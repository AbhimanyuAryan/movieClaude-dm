    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on reviews from 41 critics. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Drop has its finger on the pulse and a game cast trying to keep it alive, but despite its heart being in the right place, this comedy's electrocardiogram is as flat as the Great Plains.\"",
        "Fletcher Powell of KMUW said, \"The Drop is funny. Sometimes very funny. And a lot of that has to do with its relaxed pace\u2014a lot of movies like this would play up the shock and zaniness. These things tend to get a little too in your face. And there is plenty of shock, or at least surprise, but director and writer Sarah Adina Smith and her fantastic cast aren\u2019t concerned with telling you very loudly that this is funny, they just let it be funny.\" Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote that while the film \"doesn't always work as a comedy, it does have the ring of hard-won truth\" by demonstrating \"how someone's seemingly rock-solid reputation can be undone in an instant.\"",
        "Tara Bennett of IGN gave the film a grade of six out of ten, asserting, \"The Drop has a great premise that doesn\u2019t get fleshed out in a way that honors such an audacious idea. While Konkle and Fowler are very strong as the central relationship being tested, the script treats them more as easy punchlines trying to navigate a series of escalating, cringe-worthy friend faux paus. While there\u2019s a good amount to laugh at because of the caliber of comedians involved, by the end it lands more like great potential, mostly wasted.\" Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com gave the film one and a grade of half out of four stars, saying that despite an \"intriguing premise, The Drop never reaches its full cringe comedy potential.\"",
        "Sarah Adina Smith was nominated for Best U.S. Narrative Feature at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival."
