    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 48% of 98 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Beanie Bubble's cast makes the movie an easy watch, but that enjoyment is lessened by its shallow treatment of the real-life story.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "The New York Times critic Calum Marsh unfavorably compared The Beanie Bubble to other \"corporate biopics\" released in 2023, including Air and Tetris, and said that it \"deploys every storytelling clich\u00e9 in the book\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian criticised the film's \"deeply muddled non-storytelling and tonal blandness\", and the Evening Standard's Charlotte O'Sullivan said its \"clich\u00e9d\" script offers \"a lazy take on power and greed\". Digital Spy's Mireia Mullor called the film \"understuffed\" but said Geraldine Viswanathan's performance \"steals the show\"."
