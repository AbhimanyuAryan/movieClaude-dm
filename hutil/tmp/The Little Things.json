    "Plot": [
        "One night in 1990, a teenaged girl drives on a highway, stalked by a motorist. After stopping at a closed gas station, she catches the attention of a passing truck driver and escapes her pursuer.",
        "Some time later in Bakersfield, Kern County Sheriff's Office Deputy Sheriff Joe \"Deke\" Deacon is sent to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to collect evidence pertaining to a recent murder. A former LASD detective, he accompanies recently appointed lead detective Jimmy Baxter to the scene of a new murder in L.A. Deacon notices similarities between the M.O. of the killing and the M.O. of an old serial murder case he was unable to solve.",
        "That night, a woman named Ronda Rathbun is followed by a car while jogging and is reported missing the following morning. Baxter learns from Captain Farris that Deacon had gotten divorced and suffered a heart attack due to his obsession with the unsolved case. So, he is advised not to involve him any further, but Deacon takes vacation leave from his station to assist in solving Baxter's case.",
        "The next night, the police discover the body of another victim washed up beneath a bridge. Baxter learns the M.O. is consistent with the earlier murder and others: the victims were all prostitutes who were stabbed to death. Deacon begins investigating Albert Sparma, a suspect working at a repair store in proximity to the murders. He tails him but is thwarted, so he takes him in for questioning. While under interrogation, Sparma taunts the detectives and is released after provoking Deacon into an angry outburst. The young woman pursued in the desert is interviewed but has seen Sparma in handcuffs at the police station, which compromises her eligibility as an objective witness to identify him as a suspect.",
        "The FBI will take charge of the investigation within the week, giving Deacon and Baxter less time to resolve it. Farris informs Baxter that eight years prior, Sparma confessed to a murder which he couldn't possibly have committed and is thus an unlikely suspect. Baxter and Deacon nonetheless continue investigating. Sparma's fingerprint is similar to the killer's but not a definitive match. Their next move is an illegal search at Sparma's apartment. With Baxter standing guard outside, Deacon unsuccessfully searches the apartment for incriminating evidence, only finding newspaper clippings related to the cases. Suddenly Sparma's police scanner goes off and Deacon hears an \"officer down\" alert for this very address. As police converge on the building, Deacon narrowly escapes over the roof, with Sparma watching his ordeal and casually waving his hand at Baxter.",
        "While surveilling Sparma, Baxter corners the suspect alone and demands to know Rathbun's location. Sparma offers to drive him to where he supposedly hid Rathbun's body. Baxter cautiously agrees while Deacon secretly follows. Sparma takes Baxter to a remote area in the desert and has him dig several holes before telling him that he never killed anyone. Skeptical, he continues digging. Sparma begins to taunt him until Baxter snaps and strikes him in the face with the shovel, killing him.",
        "As Deacon arrives, a flashback reveals that he accidentally shot the one survivor of his last murder case and that Farris and Dunigan, the coroner, helped cover it up. Deacon instructs Baxter to bury Sparma in the desert, while he spends the night collecting everything in Sparma's apartment and disposing of his vehicle. Then he returns to the desert the following morning to find that Baxter has not buried Sparma but is instead still searching for the victim, desperate to believe he is the killer. Deacon (whose waking dreams are haunted by the earlier victims) advises Baxter to forget about the case or it will haunt him for life.",
        "Later, at his home, Baxter receives an envelope sent by Deacon, containing a red barrette like the one Ronda Rathbun was wearing when she was abducted. Back in Kern County, Deacon burns everything he collected in the apartment, along with a brand new pack of barrettes that is similar to the missing red one. Then, he walks away."

        "In addition, the current victims are portrayed by Sofia Vassilieva as the narrowly escaping Tina Salvatore, and Maya Kazan as Rhonda Rathbun, while the earlier victims\u00a0\u2013 seen in photos and haunting the waking dreams of Deacon\u00a0\u2013 are Anna McKitrick as Mary Roberts (whom Deacon had accidentally shot), Sheila Houlahan as Paige Callahan, and Ebony N. Mayo as Tamara Ewing."

    "Production": [
        "The first draft was written by Hancock in 1993 for Steven Spielberg to direct, but Spielberg passed because he felt the story was too dark. Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty, and Danny DeVito were all separately attached to direct before Hancock decided to helm his own screenplay. Hancock said actor Brandon Lee, who died that year, wanted a role in the film after reading the script. Lee can be seen on the TV series Ohara playing in Sparma's apartment.",
        "In March 2019, Denzel Washington signed on to star in the film. In May, Rami Malek joined the cast. In August, Jared Leto entered into talks for the role of the suspected serial killer, Albert Sparma. Natalie Morales, Joris Jarsky, Sheila Houlahan and Sofia Vassilieva were cast in September, with Michael Hyatt, Kerry O'Malley, Jason James Richter, Isabel Arraiza and John Harlan Kim joining the cast of the film in October. In November, Chris Bauer was also added.",
        "Principal photography began on September 2, 2019, in Los Angeles, California. Filming wrapped in December 2019.",

        "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 44% of 264 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.4/10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported 67% of filmgoers gave the film a positive score, with 40% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of B and compared it to Seven, writing, \"The Little Things is pulpy and ridiculous and requires some major suspension of disbelief, but \u2014 if you didn't know any better \u2014 you might even say it's beautiful.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"If the director's generally taut original screenplay settles on an ending too cryptic to be fully satisfying, the performances of Denzel Washington and Rami Malek as cops from the old school and the new who end up having more in common than they anticipated supply enough glue to hold everything together. Add in Jared Leto as the taunting weirdo who becomes their prime suspect in a series of brutal murders, and you have a suspenseful crime thriller with a dark allure.\"",
        "Writing for The Globe and Mail, Barry Hertz gave the film two and a half out of four stars, explaining, \"Hancock keeps the action moving briskly and with little tonal confusion, highlighting just what a polished studio-favoured professional can do when given gobs of money and zero intellectual-property obligations. And his trio of leading men are all given ample space to play to their strengths.\"",
        "Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, specifying, \"at a time when even small-screen procedurals have perma-frowned detectives who spend more time haunted by their past than actually solving crimes in the present, it all feels a little too familiar and a little too minor.\" Writing for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico gave the film two out of four stars, and said, \"It feels like Hancock is trying to tell a very True Detective story\u2014one about how a case can pull the people investigating it apart from the inside in a way that breaks them forever\u2014but he can't figure out how to shape that into an intriguing mystery simultaneously.\"",
        "Nick Schager of The Daily Beast wrote, \"The ghost of Seven lives on with The Little Things, as does Denzel Washington's search for the type of great serial killer thriller he missed out on when he turned down the lead role in David Fincher's 1995 genre classic. John Lee Hancock's film [...] is deeply indebted in both style and plot particulars to that predecessor, although unfortunately for it\u2014and its headliner\u2014its modest suspense is largely offset by the fact that there's nothing substantial or especially original lurking beneath its eerie exterior.\""
