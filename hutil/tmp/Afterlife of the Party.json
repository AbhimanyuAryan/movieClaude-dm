        "Christy Lemire, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film a score of 1.5/4 stars, saying that the film \"strives for both wild, physical humor and heart-tugging poignancy [but] achieves neither, occupying an uncomfortable middle ground of its own\", and added: \"Francis' authenticity and soulfulness make you wish she were at the center of the film instead of on the sidelines.\" She concluded: \"Justice may have a striking screen presence, but she can only do much with material that's less than heavenly.\"",
        "Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media gave the film a score of 3/5 stars, writing: \"Part of the problem is that the central idea of Afterlife of the Party is quite sad ... yet the film does everything it can in its first half to play this as straight comedy\"; however, she praised the film's second half, saying: \"the script delves into what Cassie is leaving behind and allows its characters to actually feel something, but the disconnect in tone is noticeable.\"",
        "Tatat Bunnag of the Bangkok Post described the film as \"a formulaic fantasy rom-com that does what's been done before, but packs it in a format for millennials and Gen Z\", and added: \"Despite being very predictable, the drama and a fair share of heartwarming elements were handled pretty well.\""
