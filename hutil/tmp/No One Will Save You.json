The film stars Kaitlyn Dever as a young woman living alone, shunned by the local townspeople, who must fight off a home invasion that has unexpected consequences. It has only five words of dialogue spoken during its entire runtime.[1]\nThe film opened in theaters on September 19, 2023, and was released to streaming services by 20th Century Studios as a Hulu original film in the United States and on Disney+ Star internationally on September 22.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nBrynn is a seamstress who lives alone in her childhood home in a forest on the outskirts of a small town. Mourning the loss of both her best friend, Maude, and her mother, Sarah, Brynn copes by constructing a model town in her living room. She leads a solitary existence and is shunned by the local townspeople. One night, she awakens to discover that a humanoid alien has broken into her home. The alien uses telekinesis to subdue her, but she accidentally kills it in self-defense with the broken fragment of a model bell tower.\nFinding that her car and all of her electrical devices have been rendered useless since the alien intrusion, Brynn cycles into town, where she uncovers evidence of alien attacks on her neighbors. The town appears unaffected as she makes her way to the local police station, where she unexpectedly encounters Maude's parents, who happen to be the chief of police and his wife. Maude's embittered mother spits in Brynn's face. Brynn flees the town on a bus, but several passengers attempt to restrain her and are revealed to be controlled by alien parasites placed in their throats. She escapes and discovers that many of the townspeople now appear to be under the parasites' control.\nBrynn returns home and fortifies her house. That evening, a tractor beam from a flying saucer carries the alien's corpse out of her house, and she is forced to fend off two more alien intruders; she impales the smaller one with a broken mop handle and immolates the bigger one when its legs become entangled in her car and she ignites the gas tank. After she runs back into her house, another alien restrains her and places a parasite in her mouth, seemingly being forced to do so against its will. Brynn experiences an intense hallucination in which her life is back to normal and Maude is still alive. She apologizes to Maude before breaking free of the hallucination and pulling the parasite from her mouth, finding herself lying in a field. A flying saucer arrives and transforms the parasite into a doppelg\u00e4nger of Brynn, which pursues the real Brynn into the woods.\nThe doppelg\u00e4nger catches Brynn and stabs her, but Brynn kills it with a box cutter and escapes to a deserted road. She encounters a gigantic alien before being sucked into a flying saucer, where she is psychically probed by a group of aliens, revealing the event that turned the town against her: during an argument she had with Maude when both were children, Maude knocked Brynn to the ground and Brynn struck Maude with a rock, killing her. The aliens converse with one another and appear to agree on a course of action. They return Brynn to the deserted road, unharmed and free of their influence.\nBrynn rebuilds her home and discovers that the other residents remain under the control of the parasites. They now treat her kindly and since she has finally overcome her trauma, she can live a normal life. In the sky, numerous flying saucers are seen stretching off into the horizon.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKaitlyn Dever as Brynn\nElizabeth Kaluev as young Brynn\nZack Duhame as the mailman\nLauren Murray as Brynn's mother\nGeraldine Singer as Mrs. Collins\nDane Rhodes as police chief Collins\nDaniel Rigamer as Mr. McCreary\nDari Lynn Griffin as Maude\nProduction[edit]\nNo One Will Save You was written as a spec script by Brian Duffield in 2019.[2] In April 2021, it was reported that 20th Century Studios had acquired the script, with Duffield set to direct and Kaitlyn Dever attached to star.[3]\nOn an estimated budget (before tax incentives) of $22.8 million, principal photography took place in New Orleans from April to June 2022.[4][5] Visual effects were provided by British company DNEG.[6] Joseph Trapanese composed the score.[7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nNo One Will Save You premiered in New York and Los Angeles theaters on September 19, 2023.[8] It was subsequently released by 20th Century Studios as a Hulu original film in the United States on September 22.[9] It premiered on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ in other territories the same day.[9]\n\nReception[edit]\nAudience viewership[edit]\nAccording to Whip Media's viewership tracking app TV Time, No One Will Save You was the most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week ending September 24, 2023,[10][11] and the third during the week of October 1, 2023.[12] According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, No One Will Save You was the third most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week of September 18 to September 24, 2023.[13]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 116 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10.
