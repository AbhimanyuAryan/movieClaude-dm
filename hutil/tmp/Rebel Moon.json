    "Plot": [
        "Atticus Noble, the sadistic admiral of the militaristic Imperium, arrives on the backwater moon of Veldt on behalf of the Motherworld, an interstellar empire fueled by centuries of conquest and war. He explains that his troops are hunting for a band of rebels led by siblings Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe, and offers to buy the village's surplus grain. The village's leader, Sindri, refuses the offer, claiming they barely have enough to survive. A farmer, Gunnar, ignores earlier warnings from Sindri and farmer Kora and indicates that the village might have some surplus. Noble kills Sindri and orders Gunnar to prepare grain for them in ten weeks, which would not leave the village with enough to survive. Noble departs, leaving a handful of soldiers and a \"Jimmy\" robot to oversee the harvest. After being harassed by a peer, Jimmy starts to become independent. One villager, Kora, finds the other soldiers holding another villager hostage, preparing to rape her, and kills them with help from Jimmy, who has defected from the soldiers. Kora warns the villagers that Noble will massacre the village once he returns, unless they mount a defense.",
        "Kora and Gunnar depart for the port town of Providence to recruit warriors for the village's defense, including Titus, a disgraced Imperium general. During their journey, she reveals to Gunnar that she once served the Imperium as a soldier, having been adopted and renamed to Arthelais by Balisarius, an Imperium commander, after he killed her family and eradicated her home planet's population. She became bodyguard to Motherworld princess Issa, who was expected to usher in an end to the Imperium's conquests. She was unable to protect Issa during her coronation, when the royal family was assassinated, and Balisarius subsequently declared himself regent before renewing its conquests.",
        "Arriving at Providence, the pair meets smuggler and criminal Kai, who agrees to take them to recruit Titus. On the way, Kai takes them to two additional warriors: Tarak, a beast tamer, and Nemesis, a talented swordswoman enhanced by cybernetics. The group arrives at a gladiator arena on a remote moon, finding Titus in a drunken stupor. Titus initially refuses but agrees to join them after Kora suggests that he avenge his fallen soldiers. Using Gunnar's previous dealings with the Bloodaxes, they then arrive at planet Sharaan to meet them and their rebellion, intending to recruit them. Darrian agrees to defend the village and brings with him a handful of rebels, including Millius, with him, while Devra and the rest of the rebellion leave Sharaan. After they depart Sharaan, Noble arrives and eradicates its population as punishment for assisting the rebels.",
        "Kai tells Kora that he has been moved by her quest to abandon his illicit life as a smuggler and that he has one last shipment to drop off to leave that life behind him. He takes the group to a trading post at which Noble's ship has arrived and restrains them save for Kai, betraying them to Noble and revealing he had always intended to do so for the bounties on their heads. Noble identifies Kora, Tarak, Nemesis and Titus for their history: Kora and Titus as deserters, Tarak as a criminal and former prince, and Nemesis as the killer of several Imperial officers in revenge for her murdered children. Kai demands that Gunnar paralyze Kora; Gunnar instead frees her and kills Kai. The other warriors are unshackled as well. Darrian is killed in the ensuing battle and Kora kills Noble. Afterwards, the surviving warriors return to Veldt together, with Jimmy watching them from afar on their way to the village.",
        "Noble's corpse is recovered by Motherworld forces, and he is resurrected after having spoken on an astral plane with Balisarius, who demands that Noble end the insurgency against him and bring Kora to him alive so he can execute her himself."

        "Rebel Moon is inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa, the Star Wars films and Heavy Metal magazines; its logo is an homage to the latter. Snyder initially conceived the idea for the film in college, before discussing it with Johnstad in 1997.",
        "Snyder then pitched it as a Star Wars film to Lucasfilm, shortly after its sale to The Walt Disney Company in 2012. He also pitched his idea as both a video game and a film to Warner Bros. Pictures \"a couple of times\". The project was at one point planned as an original television series by Snyder and producer Eric Newman, before pitching it as a film to Netflix.",
        "Following concerns from Netflix Films chairman Scott Stuber that the project would underperform due to its length, Snyder, unwilling to \"lose all the character\", decided to split the film into two parts.",
        "Sofia Boutella's casting in the lead role was announced in November 2021. Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Ray Fisher, Jena Malone, Staz Nair, Doona Bae, Stuart Martin, and Rupert Friend joined the project in February 2022. Fisher first became aware of the project around 2019 or 2020 back when Snyder planned it to be a TV show, being shown whiteboards and showing his interest when Snyder explained that those were for a \"little space thing\" he was working on. Cary Elwes, Corey Stoll, Michiel Huisman and Alfonso Herrera joined the cast in April 2022. On May 16, 2022, it was announced that Ed Skrein had replaced Friend as the film's main antagonist due to scheduling conflicts, with Cleopatra Coleman, Fra Fee and Rhian Rees joining the project. On June 8, 2022, it was announced that Anthony Hopkins had joined the cast as the voice of Jimmy, an impossibly sentient JC1435 mechanized battle robot and one-time defender of the slain king.",
        "Filming commenced on April 19, 2022, with Snyder sharing the first images from the set on Twitter that day. Snyder also served as cinematographer. It ran until December 2, with 152 days of filming taking place in California, to tap into $83 million in qualified spending and tax incentives. Stuart Martin, Cary Elwes, Rhian Rees and Ray Porter acted out and recorded the film's script for Snyder to listen to while preparing the day's shoot; they appear in the film as Den, The King, The Queen, and Hickman, respectively.",
        "For the two-part Rebel Moon, the below-the-line wages to California workers and payments to in-state vendors was $166 million.",
        "On August 20, 2023, the titles for the two parts were reported to be A Child of Fire and The Scargiver, respectively. Two days later, Zack Snyder appeared at gamescom opening night to present the teaser trailer for the two parts, which confirmed the titles."

        "Rebel Moon had a limited theatrical release on 70 mm film in four major cities: Los Angeles (Egyptian Theatre), New York City (Paris Theater), Toronto (TIFF Lightbox), and London (Prince Charles Cinema) on December 15, 2023, before its streaming debut on December 22, by Netflix. Snyder announced plans to issue an R-rated extended cut, set to release before The Scargiver, in addition to its original PG-13-rated cut."

    "Reception": [
        "After premiering December 22 on Netflix, the film garnered 23.9M views in three days, making it the #1 most viewed English-language film on the service from December 18 to 24, making it the ninth best debut for a Netflix original film released in 2023. The film stayed in first place with 34M views in its first full week of availability, following its debut weekend. The week after that, the film slipped to second place with 11.1M views. In its fourth week, it had dropped to eighth place while earning 3.9M views, as the film also earned an overall worldwide total of 72.9M views.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of 172 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Rebel Moon: Part One \u2013 A Child of Fire proves Zack Snyder hasn't lost his visual flair, but eye candy isn't enough to offset a storyline made up of various sci-fi/fantasy tropes.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 31 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. First reviews of the film were mostly negative, praising its worldbuilding and action sequences but criticizing its storytelling, character development and derivative nature.",
        "Variety writer Owen Gleiberman commented, \"while eminently watchable, [Rebel Moon] is a movie built so entirely out of spare parts that it may, in the end, be for Snyder cultists only.\" Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent gave the film 1/5 stars, calling it \"a film populated by some of the Zack Snyder's Justice League filmmaker's worst impulses: a mess of imagery, some of it attempting to shock, congregated largely around the idea of what might look good in a trailer.\" The Guardian's Charles Bramesco also gave the film 1/5 stars, writing, \"the finished product has only the vaguest contours of ambition, diminished by a half-assedness dinkifying the latest CGI-jammed saga to decide the fate of the universe.\" Roger Ebert.com's Simon Abrams gave the film 1 star out of 4 and characterized it as too similar to Star Wars and Seven Samurai, containing an over-reliance of visual spectacle with clich\u00e9d characters and themes.",
        "Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film 2/5 stars, noting its similarities to Star Wars and saying that \"this first half of Snyder's diptych... is more of a loosely doodled mood board than a functioning film \u2013 a series of pulpy tableaux that mostly sound fun in isolation, but become numbingly dull when run side by side.\" The Messenger's Jordan Hoffman gave it a score of 4/10, writing, \"As a space opera, it has none of the weight of Dune, none of the characterizations of Guardians of the Galaxy, none of the madness of Jupiter Ascending or The Fifth Element and none of the pep of Star Wars.\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Lauren Coates said, \"while Snyder may do his best to invent a dark, gripping universe to engross viewers, Rebel Moon is a limp, soulless regurgitation of tropes stolen from much more formidable films\" and gave the film a D- grade.",
        "Fred Topel of United Press International was more positive, calling the film \"an entertaining filtering of science fiction and general storytelling tropes through the lens of creator/director Zack Snyder.\" The South China Morning Post's Daniel Eagan gave it 3.5/5 stars, writing, \"What Snyder brings to the project is a sensational world-building vision and a muscular filmmaking style that can pummel viewers into submission.\" Adam Graham of The Detroit News gave it a B- grade, saying, \"To its credit, it borrows from a solid slate of sources, and while it's highly derivative, it's also highly watchable. Its referential nature helps it clip along at an expedient pace, and while it never feels like you're watching something new, it at least feels like you're watching something familiar.\""
