The film stars Anne Hathaway, Jeremy Strong, Banks Repeta, Jaylin Webb, and Anthony Hopkins. Inspired by Gray's childhood experiences,[5] the story follows a young Jewish-American boy who befriends an African-American classmate and begins to struggle with his family's expectations and growing up in a time of inequality and prejudice. It was shot in New Jersey and in Fresh Meadows, Queens, New York, where Gray grew up.\nArmageddon Time had its world premiere at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2022, and was released in the United States via a limited theatrical release on October 28, 2022, by Focus Features, before expanding wide on November 4. It received positive reviews from critics, but failed at the box office, grossing $6.6 million against a production budget of $15 million.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1980 Queens, New York City, on his first day in sixth grade, Jewish-American Paul Graff becomes friends with a rebellious African-American classmate, Johnny Davis. Johnny was held back by a year and gets harsher treatment from their teacher when they both joke around in class. Paul often disassociates from his schoolwork and draws pictures instead.\nPaul lives with his financially stable family. He is close with his maternal grandfather, Aaron Rabinowitz, who encourages him to pursue his aspiration to become an artist. His well-meaning but strict parents, Esther and Irving, are less convinced of Paul's career prospects as an artist. At night, Aaron tells Paul the story of how Aaron's mother escaped antisemitic persecution in Ukraine, fleeing to London before eventually emigrating to the U.S. with Aaron and her British husband.\nOne day, Paul and Johnny are caught smoking a joint in the restrooms, unaware that it's an illegal drug. Furious, Esther allows Irving to beat Paul as punishment. In the hope that he becomes more disciplined, Paul is sent to the Forest Manor Prep private school by his parents,[5] where his older brother Ted is studying. Meanwhile, Johnny stops going to school after being relegated to special education.\nForest Manor is financially supported by famous businessman Fred Trump, who also supports Ronald Reagan in the upcoming presidential election. Many of the students are also Reagan supporters. On Paul's first day, Fred's daughter Maryanne, one of the school's famous alumni, delivers a speech to the students about working to earn their success. Paul sees the school's advantages over his previous school but doesn't feel welcome. He is also unnerved by other students' racist comments when Johnny meets with him during recess. Johnny begins living in secret at Paul's clubhouse, having nowhere to go other than living with his sick grandmother, where foster system workers searching for Johnny have begun to visit regularly.\nWhile playing at the park on the weekend, Paul tells Aaron of his struggles at school and how he did nothing when he witnessed racism. Aaron encourages Paul to stand up against prejudice when he sees it, reminding him that while antisemitism still covertly persists, he and his family still have the privilege of being white. Shortly after, Aaron dies of bone cancer, with the family mourning his loss.\nTired of living under high expectations from family and school, as well as the unfair treatment of Johnny, Paul convinces Johnny to steal a computer from school and sell it so they can run away together. After stealing the computer, they are arrested for trying to pawn it. While being interrogated, Paul confesses that it was all his plan. But knowing that he has no options in life, Johnny takes the blame to let Paul go, much to Paul's dismay. Paul and Johnny bid farewell, as Irving arrives to take him home with no consequences because Irving once did the interrogating officer a favor. At home, Irving confesses to Paul that he is sympathetic to his frustration with America's unfair racial inequality, but tells him that they need to survive to have a good life. The two agree to not tell Esther what happened, as she is still mourning her father.\nDays later, the Graff family are disappointed by Reagan's victory in the election, while Paul is focused on schoolwork. During a Thanksgiving dance at school, Fred Trump addresses the students, expressing hope that they'll become the next successful elite. A disillusioned Paul leaves during the speech.\n\nCast[edit]\nBanks Repeta as Paul Graff\nAnne Hathaway as Esther Graff, Paul's mother and Aaron's daughter\nJeremy Strong as Irving Graff, Paul's father\nJaylin Webb as Johnny Davis, Paul's African-American friend and public school classmate\nAnthony Hopkins as Aaron Rabinowitz, Paul's grandfather\nTovah Feldshuh as Mickey Rabinowitz, Paul's grandmother and Aaron's wife\nRyan Sell as Ted Graff, Paul's older brother\nJohn Diehl as Fred Trump, a famous businessman and financier of Forest Manor Prep private school[6]\nJessica Chastain as Maryanne Trump, Fred's daughter[6]\nAndrew Polk as Mr. Turkeltaub, Paul and Johnny's public school teacher\nTeddy Coluca as Uncle Louis, Paul's uncle\nMarcia Haufrecht as Aunt Ruth, Paul's aunt\nDane Zagarino (aka Dane West) as Topper Lowell, Paul's friend at Forest Manor\nRichard Bekins as Forest Manor Headmaster Fitzroy\nDomenick Lombardozzi as Police Sergeant D\u2019Arienzo\nMarcia Jean Kurtz as Forest Manor Student Guide\nLandon James Forlenza as Chad Eastman, Topper's friend\nEva Jette Putrello as Veronika Bronfman, a Forest Manor student\nJacob MacKinnon as Edgar Romanelli, a public school student\nProduction[edit]\nWriter, director, and producer James Gray\nOn May 16, 2019, Variety reported that James Gray would write and direct Armageddon Time, a film based on his upbringing in Queens, New York.[7] Cate Blanchett was cast in May 2020,[8] with Gray saying she would shoot all her scenes in three days, including a long monologue.[9] The next month, Robert De Niro, Oscar Isaac, Donald Sutherland, and Anne Hathaway were added to the cast, with plans to film in New York City once the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were minimal.[10]\nFilming began in October 2021 in New Jersey.[11] It was initially expected to start in early 2021.[12] In October it was reported that Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Strong would also star alongside newcomers Banks Repeta, Jaylin Webb, and Ryan Sell, with Hopkins and Strong replacing De Niro and Isaac, respectively.[13][14] Production wrapped in December 2021 and Andrew Polk and Tovah Feldshuh were confirmed to star.[15][16] Domenick Lombardozzi was revealed as part of the cast in March 2022.[17] Jessica Chastain was later revealed to have replaced Blanchett in a cameo role.[18]\nThe title comes from The Clash's song \"Armagideon Time\", which is heard several times in the film.[19]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2022, where it received a seven-minute standing ovation.[20] It began a limited release in the U.S. on October 28, 2022, before expanding nationwide on November 4.[21] It was distributed in the U.S. by Focus Features and internationally by Universal Pictures.[21]\nArmageddon Time was released on VOD platforms on November 22, 2022,[22] followed by release on home media (Blu-ray and DVD) on January 3, 2023, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Studio Distribution Services.[23]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe film grossed $1.9 million domestically and $4.7 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $6.5 million. Sources such as Variety attributed this performance to poor marketing, a mixed audience reception and the general public losing interest in supporting prestige films in favor of MCU franchise and horror films in a movie-going environment altered by the pandemic.[24][25]\nGray called the film's financial performance a \"failure\" and warned that films of its kind would continue to fail commercially, adding,[26]\n\nYou\u2019re now in a situation where literally every single one of these [non-franchise] movies is not doing well, and in some ways, that\u2019s the great equalizer ... But you also know as a film person that has absolutely no bearing on the long-term reaction to a film. I\u2019m a film person, and I have no idea what the box office receipts were of, you know, A Clockwork Orange or something. So I try to divorce myself from that as well. Because I can\u2019t do anything about it.\nCritical reception[edit]\nThis section needs expansion with: Please add critical reviews. You can help by adding to it.  (January 2023)\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of 224 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Armageddon Time finds writer-director James Gray excavating his own past and returning with a well-acted drama refreshingly free of nostalgia.\"[27] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[28]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward or film festival\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAARP Movies for Grownups Awards\n\n28 January 2023\n\nBest Intergenerational Film\n\nArmageddon Time\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\n\nBest Time Capsule\n\nNominated\n\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\n28 May 2022\n\nPalme d'Or\n\nJames Gray\n\nNominated\n\n[30]\n\n\nCritics' Choice Awards\n\n15 January 2023\n\nBest Young Actor/Actress\n\nBanks Repeta\n\nNominated\n\n[31]\n\n\nCasting Society of America\n\n9 March 2023\n\nStudio or Independent Feature \u2013 Drama\n\nDouglas Aibel and Matthew Glasner\n\nNominated\n\n[32]\n\n\nGij\u00f3n International Film Festival\n\n19 November 2022\n\nBest Film\n\nJames Gray\n\nNominated\n\n[33]\n\n\nGotham Independent Film Awards\n\n28 November 2022\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nJames Gray\n\nNominated\n\n[34]\n\n\nGuild of Music Supervisors Awards\n\n5 March 2023\n\nBest Music Supervision for Film Budgeted Under 25 Million Dollars\n\nJoe Rudge\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nLas Vegas Film Critics Society\n\n11 December 2022\n\nBest Male Youth Performance (Under 21)\n\nBanks Repeta\n\nNominated\n\n[36]\n\n\nMusic City Film Critics Association\n\n9 January 2023\n\nBest Young Actor\n\nBanks Repeta\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nNational Board of Review\n\n8 December 2022\n\nTop Ten Independent Films\n\nArmageddon Time\n\nWon\n\n[38]\n\n\nNational Society of Film Critics\n\n7 January 2023\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nJames Gray\n\nRunner-up\n\n[39]\n\n\nPortland Critics Association Awards\n\n16 January 2023\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nNominated\n\n[40]\n\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society Awards\n\n6 January 2023\n\nBest Youth Performance (Under 16)\n\nJaylin Webb\n\nWon\n\n[41]\n\n\nBanks Repeta\n\nRunner-up (tied)\n\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area Film Critics Circle\n\n9 January 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nNominated\n\n[42]\n\n\nSanta Barbara International Film Festival\n\nFebruary 10, 2023\n\nVirtuoso Award\n\nJeremy Strong\n\nWon\n\n[43]\n\n\nSatellite Awards\n\n3 March 2023\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nJeremy Strong\n\nNominated\n\n[44]\n\n\nSeattle Film Critics Society\n\n17 January 2023\n\nBest Youth Performance\n\nBanks Repeta\n\nNominated\n\n[45]\n\n\nWashington D.C.
