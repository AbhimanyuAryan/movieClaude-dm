        "During the US war in Afghanistan (initial scene says in Mosul, Afghanistan which is incorrect because Mosul is in Iraq), a Marine platoon is ambushed by the Taliban, leaving only Jake Atherton and his commanding officer Captain Tom Mason as survivors. After being discharged, Jake works as a mechanic in an auto-shop owned by former gang member Earl. After Jake dispatches a group of Mexican gangsters who come to collect the debt Earl owes them, the gangsters slaughter his family in retaliation. Jake enters the nightclub where the gang members gather and kills them all. Before he is executed, the leader of the gang tells Jake that someone forced them to kill his family.",
        "Jake is extricated from prison by Mason to be recruited by a man named Sam Ramsey for a secret organization called Section 8, which is sanctioned to \u201celiminate any threats, anywhere in the world.\u201d The group of assassins goes on various missions including one to kill a senator. At this point Jake realizes the secret organization is not what it seems. He must eventually turn against the people he\u2019s working with."
