After being discharged, Jake works as a mechanic in an auto-shop owned by former gang member Earl. After Jake dispatches a group of Mexican gangsters who come to collect the debt Earl owes them, the gangsters slaughter his family in retaliation. Jake enters the nightclub where the gang members gather and kills them all. Before he is executed, the leader of the gang tells Jake that someone forced them to kill his family.\nJake is extricated from prison by Mason to be recruited by a man named Sam Ramsey for a secret organization called Section 8, which is sanctioned to \u201celiminate any threats, anywhere in the world.\u201d The group of assassins goes on various missions including one to kill a senator. At this point Jake realizes the secret organization is not what it seems. He must eventually turn against the people he\u2019s working with.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nRyan Kwanten as Jake Atherton\nDolph Lundgren as Captain Tom Mason\nDermot Mulroney as Sam Ramsey\nScott Adkins as Leonard Locke\nMickey Rourke as Earl Atherton\nRobert LaSardo as Fresh\nMaurice Compte as US Attorney General Martin Savoy\nGeoffrey Blake as Senator Jim Graham\nJessica Medina as Miss Martinez\nJustin Furstenfeld as Ajax Abernathy\nDan Matteucci as FBI Agent\nTracy Perez as Liza Mueller\nKimi Alexander as Ashton Atherton\nNoah Alexander Sosnowski as Weston Atherton\nMary Christina Brown as Agent Morrow\nPaul Sloan as Roland Brunner\nStephen Cyrus Sepher as Edward Grayson\nRobert Laenen as Enod Bacharav\nZachary Michael Cruz as Landon\n\nProduction[edit]\nCasting[edit]\nThe casting of Lundgren, Adkins and Kwanten was announced on October 20, 2021.[1]  The casting of Mulroney and Furstenfeld was announced on October 29, 2021.[2]  The casting of Rourke was announced in November 2021.[3] [2]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nIn July 2022, it was announced that RLJE Films and AMC+ acquired the rights to the film, which was released on September 23, 2022.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nIn a negative review of the film, Ewan Gleadow wrote that the feature relied on \"blind patriotism and villainous stereotypes\" yet marked \"the most minor improvements\" in Christian Sesma's direction.[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Ritman, Alex (October 20, 2021). \"Dolph Lundgren, Scott Adkins and Ryan Kwanten to Face Off in Action Movie 'Section Eight' (Exclusive)\".
