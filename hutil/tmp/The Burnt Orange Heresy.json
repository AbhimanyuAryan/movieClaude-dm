        "In February 2018, Elizabeth Debicki and Christopher Walken were cast in the film adaptation of Charles Willeford's book The Burnt Orange Heresy, to play Berenice Hollis and artist Jerome Debney, respectively. In April 2018, Claes Bang joined the film to play the lead role of James Figueras, a fiercely ambitious art critic and thief. In early September 2018, Mick Jagger was cast to play Joseph Cassidy, an art dealer. In late September 2018, Donald Sutherland was cast in the film, replacing Walken, to play an enigmatic painter who becomes the target of an art-world heist.",
        "Principal photography on the film began late September 2018 at Lake Como, Italy."

        "The Boston Herald notes that the fraudulent artist adds the image of a fly to each of his paintings, \"a metaphor for sin and evil\"; the image recurs throughout \"this dark fable\"."
