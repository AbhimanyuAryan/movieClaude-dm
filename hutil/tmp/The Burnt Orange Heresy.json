The film is based on the book of the same name by Charles Willeford and stars Claes Bang, Elizabeth Debicki, Mick Jagger, and Donald Sutherland.\nThe Burnt Orange Heresy was selected as the closing film at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and was released on March 6, 2020, by Sony Pictures Classics.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nArt critic James Figueras is enlisted by a wealthy art dealer to steal a painting from reclusive painter Jerome Debney.[3]\n\nCast[edit]\nClaes Bang as James Figueras\nElizabeth Debicki as Berenice Hollis\nMick Jagger as Joseph Cassidy\nDonald Sutherland as Jerome Debney\nRosalind Halstead as Evelina Macri\nAlessandro Fabrizi as Rodolfo\nProduction[edit]\nIn February 2018, Elizabeth Debicki and Christopher Walken were cast in the film adaptation of Charles Willeford's book The Burnt Orange Heresy, to play Berenice Hollis and artist Jerome Debney, respectively.[4] In April 2018, Claes Bang joined the film to play the lead role of James Figueras, a fiercely ambitious art critic and thief.[5] In early September 2018, Mick Jagger was cast to play Joseph Cassidy, an art dealer.[6] In late September 2018, Donald Sutherland was cast in the film, replacing Walken, to play an enigmatic painter who becomes the target of an art-world heist.[7]\nPrincipal photography on the film began late September 2018 at Lake Como, Italy.[7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on September 7, 2019.[8] Shortly after, Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights to the film.[9] It was released on March 6, 2020.[10] Following the closure of theaters a week later due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sony Pictures Classics opted to hold the film for when theaters re-open instead of putting the film on digital platforms.[11] It was re-released on August 7, 2020.[3]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 66% approval rating based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Burnt Orange Heresy has a certain stylish charm, even if -- much like the art world it depicts -- it'll strike some viewers as pretentious.\"[12] On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[13]\nThe Boston Herald notes that the fraudulent artist adds the image of a fly to each of his paintings, \"a metaphor for sin and evil\"; the image recurs throughout \"this dark fable\".[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Burnt Orange Heresy (2020)\".
