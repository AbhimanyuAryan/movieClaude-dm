It was released on April 10, 2020, by Netflix.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\n11-year-old Leo dreams of being a successful WWE wrestler. His grandmother Denise supports his love of wrestling. Leo's dad, Steve and Denise send him off to school and he rides his bike, where he meets up with his friends. They get bullied by another boy, a teacher intervenes and sends them all to the principal.\nAfter school, the bullies confront and chase him on their bikes, but Leo manages to hide inside a house holding an estate sale. Inside, Leo finds a box with a wrestling mask inside. He takes it home after the man in charge gives him permission. On TV, he sees an ad for an upcoming WWE competition. Later, Leo overhears how his mom left his dad. Also, his father needs to pay $20,000 for the mortgage to not lose the house.\nLeo tries on the mask, discovering it transforms him: his voice deepens, he takes on a very strong personality and he has super strength. Doing a Google search, he finds the legend of the mask: only a genuinely deserving champion can use its powers.\nLeo confronts his bullies, overpowering them using the mask. Erica, a girl he likes, is impressed and they become friends, but he is also punished and sent home from school. Donning the mask and alter ego \u201cKid Chaos\u201d, Leo decides to audition for the competition. After defeating fellow competitor Smooth Operator in the semi-finals, he reaches the final, against famous wrestler Samson. Leo's fame begins to alienate his friends and Erica. He later realizes and confesses to Denise that he thought the mask would solve all of his problems, but things are only getting worse. Leo apologizes to his friends, and is forgiven.\nSamson and his manager switch Leo's mask with a regular one. The competition begins, with Steve watching on TV. Samson is brutally beating Leo, when Leo realizes the mask is a fake. Steve rushes to the match. Leo climbs up the cage around the ring to avoid Samson. Realizing Samson is afraid of heights, he dares him to climb, causing him to pass out. Leo jumps down on him, officially winning the match.\nLeo gets the $50,000 check and he asks them to pass the wrestling contract with NXT to Smooth, as he is only a kid. WWE tells Leo when he is older, there will be a place for him in the organization. Two weeks later, Leo is on the school wrestling team. He has gained self-confidence without the mask and has the opportunity to wrestle his bully with his dad cheering him on from the audience.\n\nCast[edit]\nSeth Carr as Leo/Kid Chaos\nTichina Arnold as Grandma Denise\nAdam Pally as Steve\nKen Marino as Frankie Albano\nAryan Simhadri as Riyaz\nMomona Tamada as Erica\nGlen Gordon as Caleb\nKeith Lee as Smooth Operator[1]\nBabatunde Aiyegbusi as Samson\nJosh Zaharia as Trevor\nDallas Dupree Young as Mason\nBodhi Sabongui as Luke\nRenee Paquette as Renee Young (herself)\nMatt Polinsky as Corey Graves (himself)\nKofi Kingston as himself\nSheamus as himself\nMike \"The Miz\" Mizanin as himself\nLucie Guest as Ms. Cartwright\nNikola Bogojevic as Stinkface\nStephanie Bell as Lights Out Leslie\nEric Bugenhagen as Big Billy Beavers\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2019, it was announced that production on the film would begin that week in Vancouver.[2] Moreover, it was announced that Seth Carr, Tichina Arnold, Ken Marino and Adam Pally would star in the film, with professional wrestlers Kofi Kingston, The Miz, Sheamus, Otis, Mia Yim and commentators Renee Young and Corey Graves also appearing.[2]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Main Event was released on April 10, 2020 by Netflix.[3]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on 20 reviews, and an average rating of 4.9/10.[4] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"In 'The Main Event,' a magical mask helps an 11-year-old boy topple the wrestling stars of the WWE\".
