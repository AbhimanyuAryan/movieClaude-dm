        "In July 2015, a remake of Nosferatu was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing. The film was intended to be produced by Jay Van Hoy and Lars Knudsen for Studio 8. In November 2016, Eggers expressed surprise that the Nosferatu remake was going to be his second film, saying, \"It feels ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting for a filmmaker in my place to do Nosferatu next. I was really planning on waiting a while, but that's how fate shook out.\" During an interview with Den of Geek around the release of The Lighthouse in 2019, Robert Eggers revealed that although he had dedicated a lot of time to bringing the iconic horror film into the 21st century, he didn't know when or if it would happen. Despite that, Eggers said, \"Look, I spent so many years and so much time, just so much blood on it, yeah, it would be a real shame if it never happened\".",
        "In an interview with Den of Geek around the release of The Northman, Eggers was asked if he and Anya Taylor-Joy still communicated about the project, saying, \"We definitely talk about it, and I don't know why it's been so hard to make happen.\" It was revealed in March 2022 that English singer Harry Styles was briefly attached to an undisclosed role in the film, but eventually dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.",
        "In September 2022, it was announced that Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd was set to star in the titular Nosferatu, Count Orlok, with Lily-Rose Depp also attached to co-star. Nicholas Hoult entered negotiations the following month to join the cast, with all three confirmed to star by January 2023 alongside the addition of Willem Dafoe, who had previously portrayed Max Schreck/Count Orlok in the 2000 film Shadow of the Vampire. Emma Corrin would join the cast the following month. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Simon McBurney, and Ralph Ineson were revealed to be in the cast at the start of production in late February 2023.",
        "Principal photography began in the Czech Republic on February 20, 2023. Some exterior shots were also captured in Romania. Among the noteworthy filming locations was the 14th-century Ro\u017emit\u00e1l Castle in Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod Trem\u0161\u00ednem and Prague's Invalidovna complex, a Baroque building registered as a national landmark. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke revealed that the film was shot in color and was reminiscent of 19th-century Romanticism. Filming wrapped on May 19, 2023."
