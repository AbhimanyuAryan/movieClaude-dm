        "In September 2021, William Friedkin announced plans to develop an adaptation of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and that he was beginning the process of casting the film. The following year, in August, Deadline Hollywood officially reported that a new adaptation of Herman Wouk's novel The Caine Mutiny directed by Friedkin was in the works for Paramount Global Content Distribution and Showtime Networks. Kiefer Sutherland was announced to star, with Friedkin having altered Wouk's script himself to reflect a more modern timeline, setting it in the Persian Gulf, as opposed to the original's World War II setting. Principal photography began presumably in January 2023 and was completed sometime before star Lance Reddick's death in March. In the wake of his death, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro posted a tweet, praising the actor's performance in the film.",
        "Del Toro himself served as back-up director on the film for liability reasons, due to Friedkin's age, and had sat beside him every day during the shoot. Since the production had been operating on a tight schedule, Friedkin expected that everyone come to the set prepared so as to avoid doing any retakes. According to del Toro, rather than scold a particular actor who stumbled over a crucial line several times, Friedkin instead asked, \"You wanna do it in an hour or so? Or we pick it up tomorrow?\":"
