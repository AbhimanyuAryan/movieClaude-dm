    "Plot": [
        "Lennon is a backcountry ranger starting a new job in Arvores National Park where in the past, a number of fellow rangers as well as members of the public have gone missing, including Lennon's predecessor. In her ranger cabin, Lennon keeps track of these missing people. During a hike, she becomes lost and her handheld transceiver's batteries give out. Lennon hears distorted sounds and messages over the transceiver, even with its batteries out. She is found by fellow ranger Jackson, who guides her back and asks her why she joined the park rangers. Lennon avoids the question.",
        "The rangers receive a notice that a hiker, Sarah Greenberg, has gone missing. The rangers, coordinated by head ranger Zhang form a search party, but Jackson orders Lennon to stay at base camp in case Sarah returns. Spurred by her memories of when her own younger sister, Jenny, disappeared in the woods during her childhood, Lennon disobeys orders and searches for Sarah. She finds Sarah in the woods at night, bloody and disoriented, asking Lennon if she is real. Lennon notifies the team, and Sarah is rescued and taken to receive care. Zhang notifies Lennon that she is fired for disobeying a direct order from Jackson and to await airlift out of Arvores in five days. When Lennon rebuffs that they found Sarah, Jackson pointedly responds that she found Sarah.",
        "Rather than wait, Lennon hikes through the park, but begins experiencing disturbing visions. She hears Jackson over the transceiver, informing her of another missing hiker and instructing her to go find him. She searches for the hiker, but finds herself inexplicably miles away on the other side of the park by the lake. Jackson's voice distorts over the transceiver and tells her that she is where she is meant to be, and that she took something she must replace. Jenny appears and tells her that \"they\" will keep Lennon unless she replaces what she took, implying that by rescuing Sarah she took from \"them\". She finds two hikers camped in the woods, but finds that they cannot see or hear her. She sees a vision of herself, instructing herself to kill one of the campers, thereby replacing what she took. She refuses and continues to have disturbing visions, finally telling \"them\" that if murder is what will free her, then they can keep her.",
        "Lennon makes her way back her cabin, but when she enters, she finds herself in her childhood home, and is forced to relive memories of Jenny's disappearance and the devastation it caused her family. She sees missing people in the distorted house, including her predecessor and Jenny. Messages from the past reveal that Zhang found Jenny during the search, but recognized her as being \"taken\" by the entities rather than lost, and the rangers lied to her parents about Jenny's whereabouts. Zhang appears and Lennon, distraught, asks her if she is real. Zhang tells her that she is, and explains that the entities take people away for unknown reasons, keeping them in this place, and that the rangers allow them to. The entities allow the rangers to explain the phenomenon to other recruits who experience strange encounters, she speculates, because the rangers protect their dark, forested, domain. However, Zhang expresses regret for how many people she has let them take, most especially Jenny. She refuses to let them take Lennon and opts to stay behind as a replacement. She bids her goodbye, telling Lennon she will make a fine ranger, before Lennon is dragged underwater and Zhang is pulled away. Lennon emerges in the lake, and is rescued by Jackson. Lennon tells him that she knows the secret.",
        "Some time later, the new ranger recruits are sent out to their assignments, with Zhang listed as another missing person. Lennon returns to her cabin, and is called upon to find another missing hiker. She searches for him, and finds him disoriented, but when he asks her if she is real, she recognizes that he is one of the \"taken\". She responds that she is not real and walks away, leaving him to his fate."
