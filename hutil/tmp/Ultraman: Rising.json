        "The film, inspired by the character of the same name, originally began as an original idea developed by director Shannon Tindle. He conceived it while working as a character designer on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends in the mid-to-late 2000s. Tindle further developed the film, writing a script and creating art, at Sony Pictures Animation from 2016 to 2018; at the time, the plot would have followed \"a billionaire forced to grow up when he takes on the orphaned children of his former foe.\" After leaving Sony, Tindle moved to Netflix Animation to produce the live-action/animation hybrid series Lost Ollie with fellow Sony Animation director Peter Ramsey, where he had the opportunity to repurpose the plot for his film to fit with the \"Ultraman\" IP.",
        "The project was announced as a Netflix exclusive in May 2021, with Tindle to direct and co-write the film with Marc Haimes (Tindle and Haimes previously co-wrote Kubo and the Two Strings), Tom Knott to produce, Lisa Poole to co-produce, John Aoshima to co-direct, and Industrial Light & Magic to animate the film. In July 2022, Netflix released an image teasing the film's animation style and Ultraman design."
