        "In 1987 El Paso, Aristotle \"Ari\" Mendoza is a surly teenager frustrated by his parents' refusal to tell him about his incarcerated brother Bernardo. At a public pool, Ari meets unconventional fellow Mexican-American Dante Quintana, who teaches him how to swim. The two boys become fast friends despite their differences. Dante's well-off parents invite Ari on a camping trip, where both he and Dante appreciate the vastness of the night sky. During a rainy evening near the end of the summer, Dante tells Ari that the Quintanas will be moving to Chicago for the following school year due to his father's professor job. Dante gets distracted by a baby bird and is nearly hit by a car; Ari gets injured pushing him out of the way.",
        "In the year that follows, Ari adopts a dog, is gifted a truck by his parents, and slowly begins to fit in at school. He begins fooling around with a female classmate, Elena. Meanwhile, Dante's letters speak of burgeoning homosexuality. Ari finally learns what caused Bernardo's imprisonment \u2013 he had killed a trans prostitute as a teenager.",
        "The Quintanas return at the beginning of the next summer. Ari and Dante drive out to the desert, where Dante asks Ari to kiss him. The kiss makes Ari uncomfortable and he insults Dante. Ari's Tia Ophelia also passes away, and he learns that she had been disavowed by most of the extended family for living with a female partner.",
        "Dante is hospitalized after some homophobic boys attacked him in an alley after seeing him with his boyfriend Daniel. A furious Ari tracks down Daniel, then one of the perpetrators, and brutally attacks the latter. A discussion with his parents causes Ari to realize that he is in love with Dante. The two boys drive out to the desert, where Ari confesses his feelings. The film ends with them lying in the back of Ari\u2019s truck, holding hands."
