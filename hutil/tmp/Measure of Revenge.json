The film stars Melissa Leo, Bella Thorne, Jake Weary, Kevin Corrigan, Benedict Samuel, and Adrian Martinez. It follows a theater actress whose son dies mysteriously.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nBroadway actress Lillian Cooper is making her final on-stage appearance when her famous son, Curtis, is found dead. When his death is ruled as an accidental overdose, a suspicious Lillian decides to take matters into her own hands. On a quest for answers, she strikes up an unlikely alliance with her son's drug dealer, Taz, setting in motion a bloody warpath to uncover the truth and punish those who killed her son.\n\nCast[edit]\nMelissa Leo as Lillian Cooper\nBella Thorne as Taz\nJake Weary as Curtis Cooper\nKevin Corrigan as Claude Felson\nBenedict Samuel as Ronin\nAdrian Martinez as Addison\nIvan Martin as Billy\nRoma Maffia as Mona\nJasmine Carmichael as Olivia Jones\nAnnapurna Sriram as Zoe / Hamlette\nMichael Potts as Detective Eaton\nJason A.

Jen Gatien produced with Peter Wong and Timur Bekbosunov for ACE Pictures Entertainment.[2] The film's original score was composed by Nick Urata.[3]\nPrincipal photography took place in New York City, New York.[4]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn October 2021, Blue Fox Entertainment acquired international distribution rights to Measure of Revenge.[4] In February 2022, it was announced that Vertical Entertainment acquired North American distribution rights to the film and would release it in select theaters, on digital, and VOD on March 18, 2022.[2][5][6][7][8]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 12% of 17 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 2.3/10.[9] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 30 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[10]\nNadir Samara of Screen Rant gave the film two stars out of five, and said: \"Though Measure of Revenge is not an excellent film, it does have some flare. [\u2026] The script is far from perfect but if one squints, there is occasional fun to be had.\"[11] John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal commented that it \"moves with too much trepidation\u2014or too much style, one might say\u2014for a convincing urban thriller. Director Peyfa's oblique approach to the narrative leads one astray.\"[12] Michael Nordine of Variety called the film \"a mess from start to finish\" and wrote that Leo \"does her utmost to make it work, but there's simply nothing here to save.\" Nordine criticized it for \"the washed-out, smartphone-esque cinematography and incoherent screenplay, neither of which are done any favors by a series of jarring edits.\"[13] John Serba of Decider opined that \"Measure of Revenge is like Death Wish if it sucked and didn't always make sense\" and \"Leo normally is the type of actress who can find at least a nugget of credibility in a bad movie, but the odds are really stacked against her here.\"[14] Alex Saveliev of Film Threat wrote that the film \"stuffs a lot into a 90-minute narrative, and the strain shows. The plot lurches from one awkwardly-staged, heavy-handed, poorly-lit, bathed in eye-scorching soft-focus sequence to another with little regard for tonal shifts or narrative fluidity.\" Saveliev concluded by stating: \"For a film that deals with a mother's child passing, Measure of Revenge is depressing for all the wrong reasons. [\u2026] Maybe it's best for Peyfa to remain in the shadows for a while. The cinematic world may not be for him.\"[15] \nMartha K. Baker of KDHX radio, was positive about the film, praising it for \"masterful use of flashbacks, in particular scenes from Lillian's famous roles, in The Scarlet Letter and Hamlet, for example, with allusions to literature that include Edgar Allan Poe. Lines from the plays spider in and out of Lillian's mind. \"Measure of Revenge\" almost demands a second viewing to catch all the lines and allusions.\"[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ N'Duka, Amanda (September 12, 2018). \"Melissa Leo & Bella Thorne To Star In 'Leave Not One Alive'\".
