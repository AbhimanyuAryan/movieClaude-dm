It is intended to be the sixth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) and the sequel to Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), concluding the Venom trilogy. The film is directed and co-produced by Kelly Marcel, who wrote the screenplay from a story conceived with Tom Hardy, who stars as Eddie Brock and Venom. Juno Temple, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Clark Backo also star in the film.\nHardy revealed in August 2018 that he was signed on to appear in a third Venom film, and development had begun by December 2021, after the second film was released. Marcel and Hardy were writing the script by June 2022, and Marcel was set to make her directorial debut with the film that October. Additional cast members joined in mid-2023, and filming began in late June 2023 in Spain but was halted the next month due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Filming resumed in November after the strike concluded and it was nearly completed by early 2024 when the title was revealed.\nVenom: The Last Dance is scheduled to be released in the United States on October 25, 2024.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nTom Hardy as Eddie Brock / Venom: An investigative journalist who is the host of Venom, an alien symbiote that imbues him with super-human abilities.[2]\nAdditionally, Juno Temple has been cast as an undisclosed lead character,[3][4] while Chiwetel Ejiofor and Clark Backo have been cast in undisclosed roles.[4][5]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nStar Tom Hardy stated in August 2018 that he had signed on to star in three Venom films.[2] In September 2021, Hardy noted that the producers would have to continue to develop Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in future films but said they were also interested in crossing over with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) more.[6] Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) director Andy Serkis expressed interest in returning to direct another Venom film,[7] and felt there was more to explore with Venom in future films before the character could meet Spider-Man in a future crossover film,[8] including further exploration of the Ravencroft Institute and other potential villains being held there.[7] In October, Tom Holland said he and producer Amy Pascal had discussed him potentially reprising his MCU role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in future Venom sequels, after he made a cameo appearance in Let There Be Carnage via footage from the MCU film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).[9] That December, Pascal said they were in the \"planning stages\" of Venom 3.[10]\nSony Pictures confirmed the film was in development at CinemaCon in April 2022.[11] In June, Hardy revealed that Kelly Marcel was writing the screenplay after previously working on the prior Venom films and that he was co-writing the story with her.[12] Hardy was set to be paid $20\u00a0million for his involvement.[13] Serkis was unable to return as director due to his commitments to Animal Farm, which he had delayed to work on Let There Be Carnage,[14] and Marcel signed on in October to make her directorial debut with the film, which was expected to conclude the Venom trilogy.[15] She was also set to produce the film alongside Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, Pascal, Hutch Parker, and Hardy,[15] all doing so through their respective production companies Arad Productions, Matt Tolmach Productions, Pascal Pictures, Hutch Parker Entertainment, and Hardy, Son & Baker. Columbia Pictures also produces in association with Marvel Entertainment.[16]\n\nPre-production[edit]\nHardy revealed in February 2023 that pre-production work had begun.[17] Juno Temple entered negotiations to join the cast in an undisclosed \"lead role\" in April.[3] The next month, filming was expected to begin in June in London,[18][19] and Chiwetel Ejiofor joined the cast along with Temple.[4] In June, the film was set for release in October 2024.[20]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on June 26, 2023, at Los Mateos in Cartagena, Spain, as well as at the Calblanque Regional Park,[21][22] under the working title Orwell.[23] Fabian Wagner serves as the cinematographer after previously serving as an additional cinematographer on Let There Be Carnage.[18] The start of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike in mid-July 2023 resulted in filming being halted.[24] Later that month, the film was set to release on July 12, 2024.[25] When the actors' strike ended in early November 2023, Sony delayed the film to release on November 8, 2024, filling the November 2024 date that the studio had previously reserved for an untitled Marvel film. Production was preparing to resume at that time.[26] Filming resumed on November 16.[27] In February 2024, Clark Backo joined the cast in an undisclosed role,[5] and Temple said at the end of the month that filming was nearly completed.[28] The following month, the film was titled Venom: The Last Dance and its release date was moved forward to October 25, 2024.[29]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nVenom: The Last Dance is scheduled to be released in the United States on October 25, 2024, in IMAX and other premium large formats (PLFs).[29] The film was originally expected to receive an October 2024 release before it was scheduled for release on July 12, 2024, when Sony adjusted their release schedule due to the SAG-AFTRA strike.[20][25] After the strike concluded, the film's release was delayed to November 8, 2024,[26] before it was moved forward back to the October 2024 timeframe.[29]\n\nHome media[edit]\nSony signed deals with Netflix and Disney in April 2021 for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the films' theatrical and home media windows.[30][31] Netflix signed for exclusive \"pay 1 window\" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window and included future Venom films following Venom: Let There Be Carnage.[30] Disney signed for \"pay 2 window\" rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.[31][32]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Murphy, J.
