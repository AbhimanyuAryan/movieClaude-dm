    "Plot": [
        "During Alejandro\u2019s childhood in El Salvador, he and his mother create various imaginative creations, with him being his mother\u2019s finest. His mother recounts a recurring dream of him venturing into a mysterious cave, symbolizing his arrival to the unknown, otherwise the United States.",
        "In the present day, Alejandro resides in Bushwick, sharing an apartment with two roommates, including the vivacious party-lover Spray. Despite his dreams to be a wondrous toy maker at Hasbro, offering ideas like a Barbie with crossed fingers or Cabbage Patch Kids with smartphones, Alejandro faces an automated rejection email from the toy giant.",
        "Left with very few options, Alejandro acquires a job as a minder at FreezeCorp, where he is tasked with overseeing the cryogenically frozen artist Bobby. A supervisor spots him \u201ctampering\u201d with one of the machine\u2019s vital plugs, which lands him an immediate termination from his manager, Sharon, despite any damage to Bobby's health. A chance encounter with Bobby\u2019s eccentric and demanding art critic wife, Elizabeth, leads to their proposal to work together. She tasks him with collecting Bobby\u2019s 13 egg paintings for an upcoming exhibition, where she promises sponsorship upon completion. However, Alejandro is informed he cannot collect any form of payment until Elizabeth becomes his sponsor, which demeans the show\u2019s possible success due to lack of funds.",
        "Navigating the complexities of immigration bureaucracy, symbolized by surrealistic exchange rooms, Alejandro faces deportation if he fails to find a sponsor within 30 days. Desperate for payment to cover the extreme visa fees, Alejandro turns to a whimsically-presented Craigslist, taking several sketchy opportunities and jobs. He continues juggling the perplexing jobs for cash, even lending his room out and becoming a cleaning boy. He also discovers through social media that Hasbro has taken his design ideas for profit, particularly the Cabbage Patch Kids line.",
        "As Alejandro grapples with these challenges, Elizabeth introduces another assistant, the privileged Bingham, further jeopardizing Alejandro's position. Alejandro reconciles Elizabeth with Dalia, a student artist who possesses Bobby's final egg painting. Elizabeth, jealous of Dalia\u2019s relationship with Bobby, had previously written a scathing review of Dalia's work, negatively impacting her career. Alejandro writes a heartfelt apology letter on Elizabeth's behalf, leading to Dalia's tearful acceptance and release of the painting.",
        "Alejandro secures a solo show for Bobby at a Roosevelt Island gallery Elizabeth despises and chastises. However, she begrudgingly agrees and they are both disappointed to find out they are only afforded a singular wall. A frustrated Elizabeth begins to belittle the gallery's owner before hesitantly accepting to sell all of Bobby\u2019s paintings to them. Alejandro calls his mom to inform of their success, but Elizabeth interrupts with a shocking voice message. She reveals her decision to cryogenically freeze herself to remain with Bobby in the future. As well, she urges Alejandro to stand up for himself and to confront Hasbro with three things: a job in their internship program, a sponsorship from one of the higher-ups, and a visa.",
        "Empowered by Elizabeth's message, Alejandro confronts Hasbro with evidence of his stolen design, securing a job within the company. The film concludes centuries later, with a now-elderly Alejandro, who also chose cryogenic preservation, reuniting with a reawakened Elizabeth, their bond transcending time."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 114 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With Problemista, Julio Torres' utterly unique sensibilities prove a perfectly cracked lens through which to find the surreal humor in bleak aspects of the human experience.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine criticized the movie as a \"wannabe satire\" that \"succumbs to grating silliness,\" and calls the film a \u201ccase for Ale\u2019s frustrations with a world that doesn\u2019t coddle him like his mother, as well as for Torres\u2019s belief in art as a narcissistic act of self-care.\"",
        "Peter Debruge of Variety praised Swinton's performance but felt that \"Torres lacks the technical experience to pull off even a fraction of the ideas to which he aspires,\" and that \"A24 seems to have put too much faith in its director here,\" while \"there\u2019s hardly any rhyme or reason to the cast.\"",
        "Writing for Vulture, Alison Willmore observed that \"The film, like its protagonist, feels stuck in a nascent state, leaning into Elizabeth\u2019s shrill voice because it\u2019s not yet certain of its own.\""
