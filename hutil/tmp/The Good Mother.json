It stars Hilary Swank, Olivia Cooke, Jack Reynor and Hopper Penn.  \nThe film was released by Vertical Entertainment on September 1, 2023.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nAfter the murder of her estranged son, journalist Marissa Bennings forms an unusual alliance with his pregnant girlfriend to track down those responsible for his death. Together, they confront a realm of narcotics and dishonesty within the city of Albany, unearthing a deeper, more sinister revelation.[3]\n\nCast[edit]\nHilary Swank as Marissa\nOlivia Cooke as Paige\nJack Reynor as Toby\nDilone as Gina\nNorm Lewis as Jim\nHopper Penn as Ducky\nLarry Fessenden as Gary\nProduction[edit]\nIn July 2022, Variety reported that Miles Joris-Peyrafitte would direct the film, then titled Mother's Milk, which he co-wrote with Madison Harrison. Hilary Swank, Olivia Cooke and Jack Reynor were cast in leading roles. Shaun Sanghani of SSS Entertainment produced and financed the film, with Siena Oberman of Artemis Pictures and Emma Tillinger Koskoff of First Love Films also producing.[4]  Joris-Peyrafitte told People that the idea of the film came from on-set discussions about the opioid epidemic while directing As You Are (2016).[5]\nPrincipal photography took place from June to July 2022 in Albany, New York.  Filming was done at Times Union, Empire State Plaza, the Capitol, the Amtrak station in Rensselaer, and on a constructed set inside the New Scotland Avenue (Troop B) Armory on the Sage College of Albany campus.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn June 2023, Vertical Entertainment acquired the distribution rights for North America, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.  The film had a limited theatrical release in the United States on September 1, 2023.[3] It was released on digital on-demand platforms in the United States on September 19, 2023. In Australia it was released on DVD and digital platforms on November 1, 2023.[7]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe Good Mother made $367k on 419 screens over its first four days.[8] It grossed $503,378 in the United States and Canada, with $49,804 from Russia, for a worldwide total of $553,182.[2]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 21% of 53 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Good Mother has dramatic potential, a talented cast, and deals with important subjects\u2014but none of that's enough to compensate for the movie's drearily underwhelming story.\"[9] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 45 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Good Mother (15)\".
