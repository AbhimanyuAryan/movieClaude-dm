        "In July 2022, Variety reported that Miles Joris-Peyrafitte would direct the film, then titled Mother's Milk, which he co-wrote with Madison Harrison. Hilary Swank, Olivia Cooke and Jack Reynor were cast in leading roles. Shaun Sanghani of SSS Entertainment produced and financed the film, with Siena Oberman of Artemis Pictures and Emma Tillinger Koskoff of First Love Films also producing.  Joris-Peyrafitte told People that the idea of the film came from on-set discussions about the opioid epidemic while directing As You Are (2016).",
