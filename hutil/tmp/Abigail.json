Based on and a reimagining of the 1936 Universal Classic Monsters film Dracula's Daughter, the film stars Alisha Weir as the eponymous daughter of Count Dracula, alongside Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Will Catlett, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud, and Giancarlo Esposito.\nA reboot of Dracula's Daughter was announced to be in development in April 2023, with Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett attached as directors, and Shields and Busick hired to write the screenplay. It was also announced that the film would be a co-production between Bettinelli-Olpin, Gillett, and Chad Villella's Radio Silence Productions, James Vanderbilt, Paul Neinstein, and William Sherak's Project X Entertainment, and Tripp Vinson's Vinson Films. Barrera was cast that same month, with Weir, Stevens, Newton, Durand, Cloud, and Catlett hired the next month, and Esposito rounding out the main cast in June.\nPrincipal photography began that month in Dublin, Ireland, but was suspended at the beginning of July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Filming resumed at the end of that month and wrapped in December. This was the last film that Cloud worked on during his lifetime, as he died on July 31, 2023, shortly after wrapping his scenes; the film is dedicated to him. Brian Tyler, a frequent collaborator of Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett, was hired to compose and conduct the film's score.\nAbigail had its world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival on April 7, 2024, and was theatrically released by Universal Pictures in the United States on April 19, 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nSix criminals capture the ballet dancer Abigail, the daughter of a powerful underworld figure within New York, and bring her to a secluded mansion. The group, led by informant Lambert, is told not to disclose any personal information. Using aliases derived from the Rat Pack, the group consists of former Army medic and recovering drug addict Joey; former NYPD detective Frank; wealthy hacker Sammy; sociopathic driver Dean; Marine sniper Rickles; and dimwitted Canadian mob enforcer Peter. After 24 hours, each will receive a $7 million check so long as they complete the only task: ensuring Abigail's safety. Joey is sent to watch over Abigail and, as they bond, Joey reveals that she has a son. As Joey leaves, Abigail warns her about what will transpire during the night.\nAfter Dean unsuccessfully flirts with Sammy, he enters the basement and is dragged away by an unseen assailant. Sammy hears his screams but only finds a headless corpse. Frank confronts Abigail and demands to know who her father is, finding out that Abigail's father is Kristof Lazar, a feared crime-lord. Rickles tries to leave, but the home's security system activates and bars them inside. As they look for another way out, Rickles is mauled to death. Frank tells Peter to kill Abigail, Joey stops him, during the altercation Abigail suddenly transforms into a vampire, causing the group to run away in terror.\nDistressed, the group discusses how to kill Abigail, as gunshots don't harm her. Three of the four find Abigail dancing with Dean's body and use garlic, stakes, and crosses, but each prove unsuccessful. They regroup once more, and Joey suggests using the tranquilizer Lambert had given them earlier for the kidnapping. They split up again and Sammy falls into a swimming pool filled with Abigail's former victims \u2013 proving that the ransom plan was all an elaborate trap. The four manage to find Abigail and tranquilize her, though not before she manages to bite Sammy.\nUpon awakening, Abigail reveals each surviving kidnapper's identity and backstory. They leave Frank in charge of watching her; Abigail easily breaks out of her makeshift cage and starts choking him. Joey rips wooden planks off a window and exposes her to sunlight, which turns out to be her weakness. With only hours left before nightfall, the group splits up to find a way out. Sammy suddenly turns into a vampire under Abigail's control and feeds on Peter before killing him. Abigail then has Sammy attack Frank and Joey, forcing Joey to destroy her with reflected sunlight.\nHoping to deactivate the security measures, Joey and Frank find the mansion's control room and run into Lambert, who is revealed as a vampire. Lambert explains he was turned by Abigail for betraying her father and offers to turn Frank to help him kill Abigail. Frank accepts, but stakes Lambert after he turns and overpowers Abigail before drinking her blood, enhancing his new abilities. He then tells Joey that he intends to turn her into a vampire under his control after biting her. Joey resists Frank's control and teams up with Abigail, eventually managing to stake him. With Frank dead, Joey is free from the vampire's curse. She begins to leave, but Abigail's father enters. He threatens her, but when Abigail stands up to him and reveals that she saved her life, he relents and permits her to leave. Joey departs the estate to find her son, treating herself to a lollipop.\n\nCast[edit]\nMelissa Barrera as Joey[6]\nDan Stevens as Frank[1][7]\nAlisha Weir as Abigail[8]\nWill Catlett as Rickles[1]\nKathryn Newton as Sammy[9]\nKevin Durand as Peter[10][1]\nAngus Cloud as Dean[1]\nGiancarlo Esposito as Lambert[11][1]\nMatthew Goode as Kristof Laza\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn April 2023, it was reported that Radio Silence Productions was developing a monster thriller film for Universal Pictures, with Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett attached to direct, with Chad Villella serving as producer alongside William Sherak, Paul Neinstein and James Vanderbilt at Project X Entertainment, while Stephen Shields and Guy Busick would write the screenplay. The project was stated to be a modern-day adaptation of one of the Universal Classic Monsters characters similar in approach to The Invisible Man (2020) or Renfield (2023), with the synopsis being described as \"a unique take on legendary monster lore and will represent a fresh, new direction for how to celebrate classic characters\". Originally intended to be Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett's next project following the release of the fifth Scream installment, the duo delayed its realization until after Scream VI.[12]\nThe project was later stated to have originally been titled Dracula's Daughter, the same name as the 1936 film upon which it is based;[8] with Universal restating that while they had considered a singular continuity with The Mummy (2017), each release will continue to be \"rooted in the horror genre, with no restrictions on budget, rating or genre. They are not part of a shared interconnected universe, which allows each film to stand on its own. This new direction is filmmaker-driven, inviting innovative filmmakers with original, bold ideas for these characters to develop the stories and pitch them.\"[6][8][7][10] The film was officially titled Abigail in January 2024.[13]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn April 2023, Melissa Barrera was cast one of the main roles of the film after previously appearing in the filmmaking duo's Scream films.[6] The following month, Dan Stevens, Kevin Durand, Alisha Weir, Kathryn Newton, Angus Cloud, and Will Catlett joined the cast.[7][10][8][9] In June 2023, it was announced that Giancarlo Esposito was cast in a supporting role.[11] Weir, known for her role as Matilda Wormwood in the 2022 Netflix musical film, was later revealed to be playing Dracula's daughter.[14]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on June 30, 2023, in Dublin, Ireland,[15] under the working title Abducting Abigail,[16] but filming was suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[17] Aaron Morton serves as the cinematographer.[18] Cloud finished filming his scenes prior to his death on July 31, 2023.[19] Filming wrapped on December 15 of the same year.[20]\n\nMusic[edit]\nBrian Tyler composed the film's score; he collaborated with Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett on prior projects.[21]\n\nRelease[edit]\nAbigail had its world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival on April 7, 2024,[22] and was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on April 19, 2024.[9]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, Abigail was released alongside The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare and Spy \u00d7 Family Code: White, and is projected to gross $12\u201315 million from 3,300 theaters in its opening weekend.[3]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 124 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Carrying off well-worn vampire tropes with a balletic flourish, Abigail dances around the familiarity of its premise with a game cast and slick style.\"[23] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[24]\nTim Robey of The Telegraph awarded the movie four stars out of five, saying: \"Alisha Weir goes impressively off the deep end in this horror-thriller about six criminals who get more than they bargained for.\"[25]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f \"Abigal Production Information\".
