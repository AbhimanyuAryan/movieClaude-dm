        "In April 2023, it was reported that Radio Silence Productions was developing a monster thriller film for Universal Pictures, with Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett attached to direct, with Chad Villella serving as producer alongside William Sherak, Paul Neinstein and James Vanderbilt at Project X Entertainment, while Stephen Shields and Guy Busick would write the screenplay. The project was stated to be a modern-day adaptation of one of the Universal Classic Monsters characters similar in approach to The Invisible Man (2020) or Renfield (2023), with the synopsis being described as \"a unique take on legendary monster lore and will represent a fresh, new direction for how to celebrate classic characters\". Originally intended to be Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett's next project following the release of the fifth Scream installment, the duo delayed its realization until after Scream VI.",
        "The project was later stated to have originally been titled Dracula's Daughter, the same name as the 1936 film upon which it is based; with Universal restating that while they had considered a singular continuity with The Mummy (2017), each release will continue to be \"rooted in the horror genre, with no restrictions on budget, rating or genre. They are not part of a shared interconnected universe, which allows each film to stand on its own. This new direction is filmmaker-driven, inviting innovative filmmakers with original, bold ideas for these characters to develop the stories and pitch them.\" The film was officially titled Abigail in January 2024.",
        "In April 2023, Melissa Barrera was cast one of the main roles of the film after previously appearing in the filmmaking duo's Scream films. The following month, Dan Stevens, Kevin Durand, Alisha Weir, Kathryn Newton, Angus Cloud, and Will Catlett joined the cast. In June 2023, it was announced that Giancarlo Esposito was cast in a supporting role. Weir, known for her role as Matilda Wormwood in the 2022 Netflix musical film, was later revealed to be playing Dracula's daughter.",
        "Principal photography began on June 30, 2023, in Dublin, Ireland, under the working title Abducting Abigail, but filming was suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Aaron Morton serves as the cinematographer. Cloud finished filming his scenes prior to his death on July 31, 2023. Filming wrapped on December 15 of the same year.",
        "Brian Tyler composed the film's score; he collaborated with Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett on prior projects."
