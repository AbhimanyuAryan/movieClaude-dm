Less than 10 minutes after their King Air 200 private plane takes off from Marco Island, Florida, the pilot dies of a heart attack. Fort Myers air traffic controllers and a flight instructor from Danbury, Connecticut manage to teach Doug how to fly the plane and land it while the family, who attend a Church of Christ, pray for a miracle.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDennis Quaid as Doug White[5]\nHeather Graham as Terri White[6]\nJesse Metcalfe as Kari Sorenson[7]\nAbigail Rhyne as Bailey White\nJessi Case as Maggie White[8]\nBrett Rice as Jeff White\nRocky Myers as Dan Favio\nSelena Anduze as Lisa Grimm\nE.

The website's consensus reads: \"Predictable and unsubtle, On a Wing and a Prayer proves a decidedly disappointing attempt to dramatize an uplifting fact-based story.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 19 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\".[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Vlessing, Etan (January 27, 2021). \"Dennis Quaid Boards 'On A Wing And A Prayer' Drama for MGM, LightWorkers\".
