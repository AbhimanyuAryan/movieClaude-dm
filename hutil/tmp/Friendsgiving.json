Molly is mom to a five-month old baby boy and is going through a divorce, while Abby, who came out as lesbian when she was 29 years old, has spent the past year getting over being dumped by her first girlfriend.\nWhat was supposed to be a low-key holiday with just the two of them becomes a large Friendsgiving dinner party after Molly invites her fling boyfriend, Jeff, to stay for dinner, as well as her and Abby's mutual friend Lauren with her husband and children. Meanwhile, Lauren invites a few single lesbians to the party to help Abby find a new love interest and start dating again.\nMolly's estranged mother, Helen, also arrives unannounced from Sweden to stay with her, mend mother-daughter fences, and acquaint herself with her grandchild. Unbeknownst to Molly, Helen has invited Gunnar, a former boyfriend of Molly who stayed in touch with Helen through Facebook.\nOther surprise friends and guests also arrive, including Claire, a recently certified shaman who identifies as a \"shawoman\", Rick and his new wife Brianne who cannot speak audibly due to Botox injections, and Gus, a gay man whose brother has been missing for seven years.\n\nCast[edit]\nMalin \u00c5kerman as Molly\nKat Dennings as Abby\nJane Seymour as Helen\nAisha Tyler as Lauren\nChelsea Peretti as Claire\nChristine Taylor as Brianne\nDeon Cole as Dan\nRyan Hansen as Gunnar\nWanda Sykes, Margaret Cho and Fortune Feimster as Fairy Gay Mothers\nJack Donnelly as Jeff\nRiver Butcher as Denim\nAndrew Santino as Rick\nDana DeLorenzo as Barbara\nEverly and Savannah Sucher as Eden\nRose Abdoo as Linda, Abby's mother\nJoe Lando as Handsome Man\nMike Rose as Gus\nProduction[edit]\nIn May 2018, it was announced Malin \u00c5kerman, Kat Dennings, Jane Seymour, Aisha Tyler, Chelsea Peretti, Christine Taylor, Deon Cole, Ryan Hansen, Wanda Sykes and Margaret Cho, had been cast in the film, with Nicol Paone directing from a screenplay she wrote.
