The film stars Meryl Streep, James Corden, Nicole Kidman, Keegan-Michael Key, Andrew Rannells, Ariana DeBose, Tracey Ullman, Kevin Chamberlin, Mary Kay Place, and Kerry Washington, and introduces Jo Ellen Pellman in her film debut as Emma Nolan. Logan Riley Hassel, Sofia Deler, Nico Greetham, and Nathaniel J. Potvin also appear in supporting roles.\nA film adaptation of The Prom was announced to be in development in April 2019, with Murphy confirming himself to be director and also serving as a co-producer along with Alexis Martin Woodall, Adam Anders, Dori Berinstein, and former DreamWorks Animation chief creative officer Bill Damaschke. Beguelin and Martin were soon after announced to be adapting their book into the screenplay, with Beguelin working with Sklar to rework their songs from the musical for the film. Additionally, Sklar also composed the film's incidental score with David Klotz, while Murphy, Anders, and Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m served as music producers. The cast was filled out starting in June 2019, including Pellman, Streep, Corden, Kidman, Key, DeBose, Riley Hassel, Deler, Greetham, Potvin, Rannells, Ullman, Chamberlin, Place, and Washington. Principal photography took place beginning in December 2019, but was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before resuming that July. \nThe Prom had a limited theatrical release on December 4, 2020, prior to streaming on Netflix on December 11.[2] The film received mixed reviews by critics, who praised the message, musical numbers and ensemble cast, but criticized the narrative and stereotypes, as well as Corden's performance.[3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn Edgewater, Indiana, James Madison High School's head of the PTA, Mrs. Greene announces the school's prom will be canceled as the lesbian student Emma Nolan planned to attend with a girl. Emma's girlfriend is Alyssa, Mrs. Greene's closeted daughter. Principal Tom Hawkins supports Emma, but is powerless against the PTA's decision.\nMeanwhile, in NYC, Broadway stars Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman are disappointed after their show Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Story closes on opening night as the New York Times blasts their performances. They are comforted by former sitcom star Trent Oliver, who now only plays forgettable supporting roles, and Angie Dickinson, who just quit the chorus line of Chicago after being passed over for the role of Roxie Hart.\nBarry realizes they all need a cause to revitalize their careers. Finding Emma's story on Twitter, the actors drive to Indiana with the non-Equity touring cast of Godspell and publicist Sheldon Saperstein.\nAt school, Emma is bullied and harassed by students Kaylee, Shelby, Nick and Kevin, who blame her for ruining prom. The actors barge into the next PTA meeting and attempt to rally support for Emma. Hawkins, a big fan of Dee Dee's, unsuccessfully tries to get her to back off.\nThe actors book a gig as the entertainment for a monster truck rally, but are booed off the stage for preaching about acceptance. Hawkins tells them the Indiana Supreme Court has ruled that James Madison must allow Emma to attend prom. That evening, he and Dee Dee bond over dinner.\nThe next day, is promposal day. Barry visits Emma at her grandmother Bea's. She has been living here since her sixteenth birthday when her parents threw her out for being gay. Barry tells Emma that he ran away from home at 16 because he knew his parents wouldn't accept his sexual orientation and has not spoken to them since.\nIt is later revealed that the PTA has exploited a loophole in the Court's ruling by arranging for her to attend a separate prom alone while the rest of the students go to the real one at a private club. Emma calls Alyssa for support, however she is too scared of losing her mother to come out. Hawkins is disgusted when he learns the real reason that Dee Dee came to Indiana was to use Emma to prop up her career.\nThe next day, Mrs. Greene holds a press conference about the two proms. Angie comforts a heartbroken Emma, while Barry persuades Dee Dee to get Emma on her ex-husband Eddie Sharp's talk show; in response, she insists that he call his mother Vera and make peace with her. Dee Dee apologizes to Hawkins for lying to him and they reconcile. Emma, upset that Alyssa won't stand up to her mother, breaks up with her.\nTrent confronts Emma's tormentors, persuading them to support her with help from the Godspell cast. Dee Dee arrives at the motel and tells everyone she traded Eddie her house in The Hamptons for Emma's slot on his show. However, Emma turns the offer down to tell her story her own way. She sings a song she wrote during a livestream, which goes viral.\nThe actors pool their finances to throw an all-inclusive prom for Emma. Afterward, Dee Dee tells Barry she called Vera, who wants to talk to him. Vera apologizes to Barry for her past treatment of him, so they make peace.\nKaylee, Shelby, Nick and Kevin apologize to Alyssa and Emma for their behavior. Mrs. Greene tries to stop their preparations for the prom. When Alyssa reveals who she really is, her mother leaves. Alyssa and Emma reconcile.\nLater that night, Emma and Alyssa arrive early to meet with the actors, Sheldon, Bea, and Vera. Angie learns that she has been cast as Roxie Hart as Tina Louise has contracted shingles, Trent retires from acting to become James Madison's new drama teacher, and Barry is crowned prom queen. The students and many teens from the local LGBT community show up to the prom in support of Emma. As the event begins, Mrs. Greene arrives, apologizes, and embraces Alyssa, accepting her for who she is. Dee Dee and Principal Hawkins share a kiss and start a relationship. Emma and Alyssa share their first public kiss and everyone celebrates.\n\nCast[edit]\nMeryl Streep as Dee Dee Allen, a narcissistic two-time Tony award-winning Broadway actress.\nJames Corden as Barry Glickman, a narcissistic Broadway actor.\nSam Pillow as a young Barry Glickman\nNicole Kidman as Angie Dickinson, a chorus girl who has been unable to get a chance to portray Roxie Hart in Chicago.\nKeegan-Michael Key as Principal Tom Hawkins, the principal of James Madison High School.\nAndrew Rannells as Trent Oliver, a Juilliard graduate who is between gigs and starred in the sitcom Talk to the Hand.\nJo Ellen Pellman as Emma Nolan, a lesbian 17-year-old girl.\nAriana DeBose as Alyssa Greene, a cheerleader who is Emma's closeted girlfriend.\nKerry Washington as Mrs. Greene, Alyssa's mother and the head of Edgewater's PTA.\nTracey Ullman as Vera Glickman, Barry's mother.\nKevin Chamberlin as Sheldon Saperstein, Dee Dee and Barry's publicist.\nMary Kay Place as Grandma Bea, Emma's supportive grandmother who raised her when Emma's parents kicked her out of their house for coming out to them.\nLogan Riley Hassel as Kaylee, Alyssa's cheerleader friend who disapproves of Emma taking a girl to prom and has a small tattoo on her wrist.\nSofia Deler as Shelby, Alyssa and Kaylee's cheerleader friend who also disapproves of Emma taking a girl to prom and has lost her virginity.\nNico Greetham as Nick, Kaylee's boyfriend whose parents are divorced.\nNathaniel J.

Jo Ellen Pellman was also cast as Emma following a nationwide search.[12][13][14] Madelaine Petsch also auditioned for Pellman's role.[15] The project is the first film under Murphy's $300 million deal with Netflix, and fifth overall.[9][16] On January 25, 2020, Awkwafina dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts and Kevin Chamberlin was recast as Sheldon Saperstein.[17][18] On June 25, 2020, Tracey Ullman and Mary Kay Place were revealed to star in the film.[19]\nFilming commenced on December 11, 2019, in Los Angeles.[20] On March 12, 2020, production was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to this, the leads had wrapped filming, with only two days of second unit filming left, which was initially scheduled to resume in mid-April, but was ultimately delayed to summer.[21][22] Production resumed on July 23, 2020.[23]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Prom had an awards-qualifying limited theatrical release on December 4, 2020, before being released digitally on December 11 by Netflix.[24] It was the second-most watched film over its first weekend on the platform, before falling to tenth in its second week.[25][26]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Through fiery songs and dance breaks, The Prom's bonanza of glitz, glitter, and jazz hands might be enough to whisk audiences away.\"[27] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[28]\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars, writing that it is \"so goofy that you just have to enjoy it\". He went on to praise the musical numbers and the film's message of self-love.[29] Brian Pruitt of USA Today also gave the film four stars out of four, calling it a \"joyous adaptation\".[30] In AfterEllen, Claire Heuchan described the film as \"a sweet homage to all the young lesbians and gays finding the courage to live and love authentically.\"[31]  In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney noted that \"there\u2019s something to be said for the wide reach of a Netflix feature that champions the rights of LGBTQ teens, sharing a message that\u2019s easy to endorse even if the delivery tends to grate.\"[2]\nOf the opposing opinion, Mary Sollosi of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"D\" grade calling it \"narratively sloppy, emotionally false, visually ugly, morally superior, and at least 15 minutes too long\".[32] Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club gave the film a \"D+\" describing it as \"all-star, feel-good, zazzy nonsense\".[33]\nJames Corden's performance was criticized as offensive by some; Corden himself is straight while the character is gay and some said his performance perpetuated, and capitalized on, stereotypes of gay men.[3]  Regarding his depiction of a flamboyant gay man, David Rooney wrote that \"perhaps aware of the potential minefield for a straight actor playing a flaming gay stereotype, Corden channels the mannerisms without the joy.\"[2]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nArt Directors Guild Awards\n\nApril 10, 2021\n\nExcellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film\n\nJamie Walker McCall\n\nNominated\n\n[34]\n\n\nCostume Designers Guild Awards\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\nExcellence in Contemporary Film\n\nLou Eyrich\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nApril 8, 2021\n\nOutstanding Film \u2013 Wide Release\n\nThe Prom\n\nNominated\n\n[36]\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nFebruary 28, 2021\n\nBest Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy\n\nThe Prom\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nBest Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy\n\nJames Corden\n\nNominated\n\n\nMake-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards\n\nApril 3, 2021\n\nBest Contemporary Make-Up\n\nEryn Krueger Mekash, J.
