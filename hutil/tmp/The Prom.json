        "The film is based on the same premise as the musical of the same name, that uses music by Matthew Sklar, lyrics by Chad Beguelin, and a book by Bob Martin and Beguelin, based on an original concept by Jack Viertel. The film is also loosely based around the 2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy.",
        "CNN notes the film project is on \"theme with Murphy's advocacy for more inclusivity in Hollywood\" including his spearheading the 2017 Half Initiative, to \"create equal representation for women and minorities behind the camera\". Murphy announced plans for the adaptation during a charity performance of the musical at New York's Longacre Theatre in April 2019.",
        "On June 25, 2019, Meryl Streep, James Corden, Andrew Rannells and Nicole Kidman were revealed to be cast as the four leads, with Keegan-Michael Key as the school principal. Ariana Grande was initially cast as Alyssa Greene, a popular but closeted cheerleader and Emma's girlfriend, but scheduling conflicts with the Sweetener World Tour forced Grande to drop out. Kerry Washington was cast in October, with Ariana DeBose joining in November, replacing Grande in the role of Alyssa. Jo Ellen Pellman was also cast as Emma following a nationwide search. Madelaine Petsch also auditioned for Pellman's role. The project is the first film under Murphy's $300 million deal with Netflix, and fifth overall. On January 25, 2020, Awkwafina dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts and Kevin Chamberlin was recast as Sheldon Saperstein. On June 25, 2020, Tracey Ullman and Mary Kay Place were revealed to star in the film.",

    "Reception": [
        "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Through fiery songs and dance breaks, The Prom's bonanza of glitz, glitter, and jazz hands might be enough to whisk audiences away.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars, writing that it is \"so goofy that you just have to enjoy it\". He went on to praise the musical numbers and the film's message of self-love. Brian Pruitt of USA Today also gave the film four stars out of four, calling it a \"joyous adaptation\". In AfterEllen, Claire Heuchan described the film as \"a sweet homage to all the young lesbians and gays finding the courage to live and love authentically.\"  In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney noted that \"there\u2019s something to be said for the wide reach of a Netflix feature that champions the rights of LGBTQ teens, sharing a message that\u2019s easy to endorse even if the delivery tends to grate.\"",
        "Of the opposing opinion, Mary Sollosi of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"D\" grade calling it \"narratively sloppy, emotionally false, visually ugly, morally superior, and at least 15 minutes too long\". Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club gave the film a \"D+\" describing it as \"all-star, feel-good, zazzy nonsense\".",
        "James Corden's performance was criticized as offensive by some; Corden himself is straight while the character is gay and some said his performance perpetuated, and capitalized on, stereotypes of gay men.  Regarding his depiction of a flamboyant gay man, David Rooney wrote that \"perhaps aware of the potential minefield for a straight actor playing a flaming gay stereotype, Corden channels the mannerisms without the joy.\""
