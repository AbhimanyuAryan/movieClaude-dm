Chu and written by Winnie Holzman. It is the first of a two-part film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman, which in turn was based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire. The film stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, with Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Peter Dinklage, Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James, and Keala Settle in supporting roles. Set in the Land of Oz before and continuing after Dorothy Gale's arrival from Kansas, the film revolves around Elphaba Thropp, a green-skinned woman, and explores the path that leads her to ultimately become the Wicked Witch of the West, all while forming an unlikely friendship and later rivalry with Galinda Upland, who would go on to become Glinda the Good.\nIn 2012, Universal Pictures announced the film's development with Marc Platt as a producer. After a long development and multiple delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chu was hired to direct, with Erivo and Grande cast in their respective roles in 2021. Principal photography began in December 2022 in England, but was paused from July until November 2023 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Filming eventually resumed and concluded in January 2024.\nWicked is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on November 27, 2024. The sequel, simply entitled Wicked Part Two, is set to be released on November 26, 2025.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nThe film stars Cynthia Erivo (left) as Elphaba and Ariana Grande (right) as Glinda.\nCynthia Erivo as Elphaba Thropp, a young woman born with green skin who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.[1][2]\nAriana Grande as Glinda Upland, a popular young woman who later becomes Glinda the Good.[1][2]\nMichelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, the headmistress of Shiz University[3]\nJeff Goldblum as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz[4]\nJonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar, a Winkie prince who meets Elphaba and Glinda at school.[5]\nEthan Slater as Boq, a Munchkin in love with Galinda[2]\nMarissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp, Elphaba's paraplegic younger sister who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the East[6]\nPeter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond, a Goat and a History professor at Shiz University[7]\nBowen Yang as Pfannee, one of Galinda's college friends[6]\nBronwyn James as ShenShen, another of Galinda's college friends[6]\nKeala Settle as Miss Coddle, a new character created for this film\nAaron Teoh as Averic, Fiyero's friend\nGrecia de la Paz as Gilligan\nColin Michael Carmichael as Professor Nikidik, a professor at Shiz University\nAdam James as Glinda's father, another new character created for this film\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nDirector Jon M. Chu (left) and composer Stephen Schwartz\nIn 2003, the Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, a revisionist exploration of the characters and setting of L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was adapted as the Broadway musical Wicked. The musical was produced by Universal Pictures' stage division and directed by Joe Mantello, with musical staging by Wayne Cilento. The Broadway production has inspired long-run productions in Chicago, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, as well as Germany and Japan. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning three, and is the 4th longest-running Broadway show in history, with over 7,500 performances. The original Broadway production starred Idina Menzel as Elphaba and Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda.\nIn a 2009 interview, Maguire stated that he had sold the rights to ABC to make an independent non-musical TV adaptation of Wicked. It would not be based on Holzman's script.[8] On January 9, 2011, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly that ABC would be teaming up with Salma Hayek and her production company to create a TV miniseries of Wicked based solely on Maguire's novel. No further information, such as casting, had been revealed yet.[9]\nChenoweth and Menzel were mentioned as possible film leads. Lea Michele and Amy Adams were also rumored to be potential leads. Potential writers included Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz, while J. J. Abrams, Rob Marshall,  James Mangold, and Ryan Murphy were mentioned as possible candidates for director.[10] In December 2012, following the success of Les Mis\u00e9rables,[11][12] Marc Platt, also a producer of the stage version, announced the film was going ahead,[13] later confirming the film was aiming for a 2016 release.[14] After a long development, Universal announced in 2016 that the film would be released in theatres on December 20, 2019, with Stephen Daldry directing.[15] By 2024, Holzman was credited as the sole writer.[16]\n\nPre-production[edit]\nIn May 2017, Schwartz stated that the film would feature \"at least two\" new songs.[17] On August 31, 2018, Universal put the film on hold, due to production scheduling, and gave the film adaptation of Cats the release date formerly held by the film.[18] On February 8, 2019, Universal announced a new release date of December 22, 2021, for the Wicked film.[19] On April 1, 2020, Universal put the film on hold once again due to Universal shifting release dates amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and gave Sing 2 the 2021 release date.[20] On October 20, 2020, it was announced that Daldry had left the production due to scheduling conflicts. On February 2, 2021, it was announced that Jon M. Chu will take over as director.[21][22] In August, Alice Brooks was confirmed as the film's cinematographer, after working with Chu before on the film version of In the Heights.[23]\n\nThe film's main supporting cast includes Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.\nIn November, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo were cast as Glinda and Elphaba.[1] Grande had previously performed \"The Wizard and I\", a song from the musical, in the NBC special Wicked 15th Anniversary. Erivo previously had performed \"I Couldn't Be Happier\", a song from the musical, in the PBS special Wicked in Concert.[24] In June 2022, Chu confirmed the hiring of Nathan Crowley as production designer.[25] On September 21, 2022, it was reported that Jonathan Bailey had joined the cast as Fiyero.[5] In October 2022, it was announced that Jeff Goldblum was in final talks to star as The Wizard.[26] Goldblum completed talks by December,[4] when Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James, Keala Settle, Aaron Teoh and Colin Michael Carmichael were added to the cast.[2][3][6] In April 2024, it was revealed at the 2024 CinemaCon that Peter Dinklage had been cast as Dr. Dillamond.[27]\n\nAbout preparing for the role of Elphaba, Erivo said to Variety, while expressing her desire to see the stage version on Broadway again before filming: \"I'm relearning everything ... I want to go and see it again. ... When I get to New York at some point I'll pop in and see the show again, that'll be my fifth time.\" She also said at that time that discussions were underway on what the film will look like, particularly its production design and visual style, and confirmed the hiring of Paul Tazewell as costume designer. Her request to him for Elphaba's costume when she becomes the Wicked Witch of the West involved \"a Jean Paul Gaultier collection with a 'new world, kind of gilded age' feeling\".[28] \nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography was set to commence in June 2022 at the Sky Studios Elstree facilities in the United Kingdom.[29] In July 2021, Stephen Schwartz indicated there were plans to film in Atlanta that year.[30] On April 26, 2022, Chu announced the adaptation will be filmed in two parts, Wicked and Wicked Part Two, saying:[31]As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of 'Wicked' into a single film without doing some real damage to it ... As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one 'Wicked' movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of 'Wicked' as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.\nIn June 2022, Stephen Schwartz confirmed that a new song would be written for one of the two films:[32]We found it very difficult to get past 'Defying Gravity' without a break ... That song is written specifically to bring a curtain down, and whatever scene to follow it without a break just seemed hugely anti-climactic ... Even as a very long single movie, it required us cutting or omitting things that we wanted to include and that we think fans of the show and the story will appreciate. What we have discussed is that changes need to be 'additive,' to use (producer) Marc Platt's term. They need to add something to the story or the characters. They can't just be changes to do something different. I feel confident that by the time the movie is made, if we all continue to have the same degree of input, I could have a conversation with anyone who has a question about any of the changes made from the stage show and justify why I think it's better for the movie.\nOn July 18, it was revealed that with the filming process settled at the newly-built Sky Studios in Elstree, England, rehearsals would begin in August with principal photography beginning in November.[33] On December 9, Chu confirmed on Twitter that filming had begun.[34]\nOn September 23, Planning Statement, in support of a planning application submitted on behalf of Western Sky Limited, indicated that outdoor filming would occur at a site being developed at Ivinghoe Turf[35] in Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire, UK. The original planned shooting dates were between April 6, 2023 and July 14, 2023, with principal photography set to wrap on July 25, 2023,[36][37] before filming was suspended from July 13, 2023 to November 8, 2023 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[38] Filming resumed on January 24, 2024 and concluded on January 26, with Chu then revealing that the vocals of the actors during the musical numbers were recorded live on set. Academy Award-winning production sound mixer Simon Hayes collaborated with Chu on the recordings of the actors' vocals, using a variation of the same recording techniques that were implemented on Les Mis\u00e9rables.[39][40][41][42]\n\nPost-production and visual effects[edit]\nOn February 6, 2024, it was confirmed on Twitter that Industrial Light & Magic and Framestore[43] will provide the film's visual effects with Pablo Helman serving as production visual effects supervisor, and that post-production work was in progress, with Chu working remotely with editor Myron Kerstein via communication through the newly-released Apple Vision Pro.[44][45][46]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe soundtrack albums for both Wicked and Wicked Part Two will be released by Republic Records/Verve Label Group, Grande and Erivo's respective record labels.\n\nMarketing[edit]\nOn April 16, 2023, first-look pictures of the film were released through social media, featuring Erivo's Elphaba and Grande's Glinda.[47][48] Exclusive work-in-progress footage from the film, featuring first listens to Grande and Erivo's respective renditions of \"Popular\" and \"Defying Gravity\", was then presented at CinemaCon on April 26, 2023, introduced on stage by Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna Langley.[49] The first trailer for the film premiered during Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024.[50][51] The film returned to CinemaCon on April 10, 2024 to present new footage and marked the first time the cast and crew appeared together in public to promote the film. Costumes and props were also on display in the lobby of the venue during this event.[52]\n\nRelease[edit]\nOriginally announced as one film, Wicked was split into two films in April 2022. The first half, titled simply Wicked, is scheduled to be released theatrically, with engagements in IMAX and Dolby Cinema, on November 27, 2024, by Universal Pictures. It was originally scheduled to be released theatrically on December 20, 2019, December 22, 2021 and December 25, 2024,[31] but on March 14, 2023, it was announced that it would be moved up to its current November release date to avoid competition with Avatar 3 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the former of which was later delayed to 2025 after Thunderbolts*, and later Mufasa: The Lion King took its date.[53]\n\nSequel[edit]\nMain article: Wicked Part Two\nA sequel, Wicked Part Two, is scheduled to be released on November 26, 2025, after previously being set for a December 25, 2025 release.[54]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Shaffer, Ellise; Donnelly, Matt (November 4, 2021). \"Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo to Star in 'Wicked' Musical for Universal\".
