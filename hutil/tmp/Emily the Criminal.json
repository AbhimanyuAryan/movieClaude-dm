    "Plot": [
        "Emily Benetto lives in Los Angeles and is deeply in debt. She struggles to pay off her student loans, and a felony conviction for aggravated assault prevents her from obtaining a well-paying job. She delivers food as an independent contractor for a catering company.",
        "A co-worker connects Emily to a \"dummy shopper\" service that promises to make her $200 in one hour. The service is revealed to be a credit card fraud ring. Emily meets Youcef, one of its organizers, who instructs her to purchase a flat-screen TV using a fake card and ID. The next day, Emily is sent to purchase a car. However, the dealer discovers the scam, leading to a physical altercation and Emily is injured.",
        "As Youcef tends to her wounds they discuss their aspirations. Emily, an aspiring artist, wishes to visit South America, while Youcef plans to purchase a rental property. Emily asks for a bigger role in his operation, and Youcef teaches her how to make fake credit cards. He gives her a taser for protection and instructs her not to sell stolen goods at her home or scam the same store twice a week. When Youcef's partner and cousin Khalil discovers them together, Youcef denies working with Emily. While Emily dogsits for her childhood friend Liz, a buyer finds her apartment and robs her earnings, taking the dog as well. She tases the buyer and reclaims both.",
        "Emily invites Youcef to a party, which sparks a romance between them. When there is an opening at Liz's advertising agency, she gets Emily an interview with her boss Alice. However, at the interview, Emily discovers the \"job\" is merely an unpaid internship. When Emily objects, Alice insults her and calls her spoiled.",
        "At a dinner with Youcef's family, Khalil reveals that Emily has been caught hitting the same store twice within a week, prompting the store to post security footage of her online. This leads to a falling-out between Youcef and Khalil, who cuts him out of the fraud ring and refuses to pay him for his past work. Youcef decides to rob the fraud ring itself. He and Emily arrive at the ring's storage unit to find that Khalil has already taken everything and emptied their shared business bank account. Emily then convinces Youcef to ambush Khalil at his safehouse.",
        "As they arrive at the safehouse, Youcef asks Emily what her assault conviction was for. She replies that she had been dating a guy she frequently fought with, and then implies that one day she snapped and attacked him. She then confesses that her mistake was that she \"didn't go far enough\", that she \"didn't really scare him\", because if she had, \"he would've never called the police\".",
        "They enter the safehouse, where Khalil severely injures Youcef before Emily can subdue him. Taking the ring's money and assisting Youcef to his car, she realizes they have lost his car keys and cannot drive away. As police and ambulance sirens draw closer, Emily abandons Youcef in his car and flees with the money.",
        "The police raid Emily's apartment and find it empty. Now living in South America, she returns to making art. She also establishes a credit card fraud ring of her own, recruiting dummy shoppers with the promise of making $200 in one hour."

    "Reception": [
        "Emily the Criminal grossed $2.2 million in North America, against a production budget of $2 million.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 196 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A taut thriller that contains a wealth of social commentary, Emily the Criminal is stolen by Aubrey Plaza's terrific work in the title role.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Deadline Hollywood's Damon White wrote: \"[While] Ford doesn't insult us with clich\u00e9s about kick-ass heroines, he does give us a deceptively rich script that explains where Emily has come to\u2014and where she will go, ensuring a satisfying ending that, while dark, doesn't feel too sugar-coated.\"",
        "Kate Erbland from IndieWire gave the film an A\u2212 and wrote of Plaza's character Emily: \"Is she likable? Is she redeemable? Is she a hero? As Emily might ask, who gives a fuck? With a film and a star this in control of its pitch-black material, she's not wrong. We're just along for the ride, and wouldn't have it any other way.\"",
        "Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars and praised Ford's direction, calling it \"an undeniably striking debut, slick and involving enough to have us curiously excited for whatever he decides to do next\"."
