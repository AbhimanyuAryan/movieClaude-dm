        "The film initially began development in January 2020, but fell apart amid the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. That October, producer Alex Saks approached director Katie Aselton saying she had secured about $500,000 of funding. In March 2021, it was announced Diane Keaton, Elizabeth Lail, Taylour Paige, Dustin Milligan, Simon Rex, Nicole Byer, Patti Harrison, Loretta Devine, Wendie Malick, Lois Smith and Amy Hill had joined the cast of the film, with a screenplay by Madeline Walter and Paul Welsh. Shortly after, it was reported that Elizabeth Lail joined to the cast.",
        "Principal photography began on March 25, 2021 and concluded on April 23, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. Due to a limited production budget and the ongoing pandemic, several changes had to be made to the script during shooting, including the forced removal of a Coachella sequence due to the event's cancellation and combining days of shooting into one, as well as not being able to have chemistry tests between the actors prior to filming."

    "Reception": [
        "The film made $310,000 from 1,930 theaters on its first day. It went on to debut to $1.1 million.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 23% of 64 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Diane Keaton gives Mack & Rita her all, but this cloying comedy lets her down at nearly every turn.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak gave the film a 61% overall positive score, with 46% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Lisa Kennedy of The New York Times commended Aselton's \"unexpected beats\" as a director for capturing the \"esprit de girlfriends\" quality of Insecure, despite borrowing from Nancy Meyers' \"rom-com catalog of upscale homes.\" Nell Minow, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave credit to Paige and Milligan's performances but wrote that \"[T]he film's promising setup and excellent cast are let down by a script so forgettable that even to try to summarize it is to feel it dissolve from memory.\" Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times was also critical of the film's script, saying it \"ditches character establishment and clear conflict for fish-out-of-water physical comedy and some vaguely affirmative lessons about learning to be yourself, unapologetically.\" The A.V. Club's Courtney Howard and Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt both gave the movie an overall C+ grade, the former saying it followed the same \"whimsical fantasy boilerplate\" of the body-swap subgenre with similar themes of \"confidence, regret and friendship\" and the latter calling it \"a body-swap comedy so daffy and weightless it nearly levitates.\" Amy Nicholson of Variety called it \"a bewildering generational culture-war comedy\", criticizing the mixed messages on agism and the \"underwritten\" roles given to the supporting cast."
