        "In July 2019, Justin Baldoni optioned the novel for a film adaptation, produced through his Wayfarer Entertainment company. In January 2023, Blake Lively was cast in the role of Lily Bloom. Baldoni, who will play Ryle Kincaid, is set to direct and Christy Hall will adapt the script. In April 2023, Brandon Sklenar was cast to play the role of Atlas. Filming began in Hoboken, New Jersey at Field Colony, a workspace and art gallery, on May 5, 2023. The next month, production had to temporarily pause due to the 2023 WGA strike. Just over half of the film was completed when production shut down. The production was still on hold when the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, 2023. Filming resumed in the Newport neighborhood of Jersey City on January 5, 2024. That same month, Isabela Ferrer and Alex Neustaedter joined the cast as the younger versions of Lily and Atlas."
