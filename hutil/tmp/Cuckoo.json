The film stars Hunter Schafer, Jan Bluthardt, Marton Csokas, Jessica Henwick and Dan Stevens. \nCuckoo had its world premiere at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival on February 16, 2024, and is scheduled to be released in Germany on July 18, 2024, and in the United States by Neon on August 9, 2024.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nHunter Schafer as Gretchen\nDan Stevens as Mr. K\u00f6nig\nJessica Henwick as Beth\nJan Bluthardt as Henry\nMarton Csokas as Luis\nGreta Fern\u00e1ndez as Trixie\n\u00c0strid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey as Ed\nKonrad Singer as Erik\nProschat Madani as Dr. Bonomo\nKalin Morrow as The Hooded Woman\nProduction[edit]\nIt was reported in August 2021 that Tilman Singer would be writing and directing his second film for Neon, with Hunter Schafer, John Malkovich, Gemma Chan and Sofia Boutella set to star.[2] In July 2022, Dan Stevens, Jessica Henwick, Marton Csokas and Greta Fern\u00e1ndez joined the cast, while Malkovich and Chan dropped out due to \"timing issues\".[3] Cuckoo is a co-production with Germany's Fiction Park and the United States' Waypoint Entertainment.[3] Principal photography took place in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, over a span of 35 days from May and July 2022, and was shot on 35mm film.[4][5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nCuckoo had its world premiere at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival in the Berlinale Special section on  February 16, 2024.[6] It also screened at South by Southwest on March 14, 2024, and at the Overlook Film Festival on April 4, 2024.[7][8] The film is scheduled to be released in Germany by Weltkino Filmverleih\u00a0[de] on July 18, 2024,[9] and will later be released in the United States by Neon on August 9, 2024.[10] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3, 2024.[11]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10.[12] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[13]\nAdam Solomons of IndieWire gave the film a C- grade, writing: \"Yet the biggest crime of Cuckoo is that it won't lean into being a B-movie, something it might've been good at. The performances \u2014 especially Stevens' \u2014 are silly and sincere, and the action competent enough for Cuckoo to have worked as pure pulp. But this film takes itself too seriously and pokes fun at its own silliness, a fatal combination\".[14] RogerEbert.com's Robert Daniels also praised Stevens, noting, \"Every choice Stevens makes as Mr. K\u00f6nig doubles as a lampoon and a threat, as equally hilarious and sadistic.\"[15] Jessica Kiang of Variety called it \"an energetically outlandish fusion of stylish atmospherics, old-school reproductive horror and pro-flickknife advertorial\".[1]\nThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney ended his review with, \"It's ultimately too silly to be truly chilling, but with Neon behind it, Cuckoo might just be cuckoo enough to draw some cult attention\".[16] Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave the film a score of two out of five, writing that is exudes \"more uncertainty than discipline, this wackadoo horror-thriller from German writer-director Tilman Singer can't decide if wearing a smirk will see it through a sloppily developed plot, which keeps promising more than it delivers. With another redraft, a tauter edit, it might have snapped into focus\".[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Kiang, Jessica (February 16, 2024). \"Cuckoo Review: A Superb Hunter Schafer is Menaced by a Loopy Dan Stevens in a Stylish, Enjoyably Incoherent Horror Romp\".
