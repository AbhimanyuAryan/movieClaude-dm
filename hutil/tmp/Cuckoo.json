    "Production": [
        "It was reported in August 2021 that Tilman Singer would be writing and directing his second film for Neon, with Hunter Schafer, John Malkovich, Gemma Chan and Sofia Boutella set to star. In July 2022, Dan Stevens, Jessica Henwick, Marton Csokas and Greta Fern\u00e1ndez joined the cast, while Malkovich and Chan dropped out due to \"timing issues\". Cuckoo is a co-production with Germany's Fiction Park and the United States' Waypoint Entertainment. Principal photography took place in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, over a span of 35 days from May and July 2022, and was shot on 35mm film."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Adam Solomons of IndieWire gave the film a C- grade, writing: \"Yet the biggest crime of Cuckoo is that it won't lean into being a B-movie, something it might've been good at. The performances \u2014 especially Stevens' \u2014 are silly and sincere, and the action competent enough for Cuckoo to have worked as pure pulp. But this film takes itself too seriously and pokes fun at its own silliness, a fatal combination\". RogerEbert.com's Robert Daniels also praised Stevens, noting, \"Every choice Stevens makes as Mr. K\u00f6nig doubles as a lampoon and a threat, as equally hilarious and sadistic.\" Jessica Kiang of Variety called it \"an energetically outlandish fusion of stylish atmospherics, old-school reproductive horror and pro-flickknife advertorial\".",
        "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney ended his review with, \"It's ultimately too silly to be truly chilling, but with Neon behind it, Cuckoo might just be cuckoo enough to draw some cult attention\". Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave the film a score of two out of five, writing that is exudes \"more uncertainty than discipline, this wackadoo horror-thriller from German writer-director Tilman Singer can't decide if wearing a smirk will see it through a sloppily developed plot, which keeps promising more than it delivers. With another redraft, a tauter edit, it might have snapped into focus\"."
