        "David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"it plays like a tonally uncertain blend of desert neo-noir, prickly buddy movie, misfit character study and crime thriller, with zero psychological grounding and even less suspense\". Christian Zilko of IndieWire called the film \"a competent but emotionally thin story\", and gave it a grade of B\u2212.",
        "Patrice Witherspoon of Screen Rant described the film as \"a dumpster fire from start to finish\", criticizing the plot, tonal shifts, and performances, except for Quinto's performance, which she praised as the film's highlights."
