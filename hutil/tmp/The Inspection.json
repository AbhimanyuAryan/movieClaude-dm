Inspired by Bratton's real-life experiences, the film follows a young gay black man who defiantly endures brutal training at a Marine Corps boot camp, seeking approval from his homophobic mother. It stars Jeremy Pope, Ra\u00fal Castillo, McCaul Lombardi, Aaron Dominguez, Nicholas Logan, Eman Esfandi, Andrew Kai, Aubrey Joseph, Bokeem Woodbine, and Gabrielle Union.\nThe Inspection had its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 18 by A24. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Pope's performance being praised and earning a Golden Globe nomination.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nEllis French enlists in the Marine Corps and ends up at boot camp on Parris Island, South Carolina. He initially meets the physical requirements, but is not as successful in disguising his sexual orientation, making him the target of a near-lethal hazing from training instructor Leland Laws and a fellow recruit, Laurence Harvey.\n\nCast[edit]\nJeremy Pope as Ellis French\nRa\u00fal Castillo as Rosales\nBokeem Woodbine as Leland Laws\nGabrielle Union as Inez French\nMcCaul Lombardi as Laurence Harvey\nAaron Dominguez as Castro\nNicholas Logan as Brooks\nEman Esfandi as Ismail\nAndrew Kai as Label\nAubrey Joseph as Boles\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2021, it was announced Jeremy Pope, Gabrielle Union, Bokeem Woodbine and Ra\u00fal Castillo had joined the cast of the film, with Elegance Bratton directing from a screenplay he wrote, with Gamechanger Films set to produce, and A24 set to produce and distribute.[4][5] Principal photography concluded by November 2021.[6]\n\nMusic[edit]\nBratton enlisted Animal Collective to compose and perform a score for the film. The soundtrack album, which features a collaboration with Indigo De Souza titled \"Wish I Knew You\", was released on November 18.[7] Art pop musician Serpentwithfeet composed \"The Hands\", featured in the film's end credits.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2022.[9] It also screened at the 60th New York Film Festival on October 14, 2022.[10] It was released in the United States on November 18, 2022.[11]\nThe film was released for VOD on January 24, 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on February 21, 2023.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of 140 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Although it's frustratingly clumsy in certain respects, The Inspection is an affecting actors' showcase in service of some truly worthy themes.\"[13] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[14]\nDieter O\u00dfwald, film correspondent for the Guild of German Film Art Theaters, writes that Bratton's impressive feature debut, which he describes as a \"queer Full Metal Jacket\", tells of a chapter of intolerance, discrimination and homophobia in the U.S., where until 2005 the official motto in the U.S. military was still \"don't ask, don't tell\" and coming out in uniform was considered unthinkable. In this context, O\u00dfwald quotes an instructor in the film: \"If we kicked all the gays out of the Army, there would be no more Marines.\" Showing such an ambivalent figure is part of the dramaturgical cleverness of the drama, which does not leave conflicts in the clich\u00e9, but deliberately presents the contradictions.[15]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAARP Movies for Grownups Awards\n\nJanuary 28, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nNominated\n\n[16]\n\n\nAfrican-American Film Critics Association\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nBest Actor\n\nJeremy Pope\n\nWon\n\n[17]\n\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\nBest Actor\n\nJeremy Pope\n\nNominated\n\n[18]\n\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nOutstanding Independent Film\n\nThe Inspection\n\nWon\n\n[19]\n\n\nOutstanding Director\n\nElegance Bratton\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Screenplay\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Emerging Director\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding First Screenplay\n\nWon\n\n\nOutstanding Actor\n\nJeremy Pope\n\nWon\n\n\nOutstanding Breakthrough Performance, Male\n\nWon\n\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor\n\nBokeem Woodbine\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Ensemble - Casting Director\n\nKim Coleman\n\nNominated\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nMarch 30, 2023\n\nOutstanding Film \u2013 Limited Release\n\nThe Inspection\n\nWon\n\n[20]\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nBest Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama\n\nJeremy Pope\n\nNominated\n\n[21]\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association Creative Arts Awards\n\nFebruary 17, 2023\n\nBest First Feature\n\nElegance Bratton\n\nNominated\n\n[22]\n\n\nHouston Film Critics Society\n\nFebruary 18, 2023\n\nBest New Filmmaker\n\nElegance Bratton\n\nNominated\n\n[23]\n\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards\n\nMarch 4, 2023\n\nBest Lead Performance\n\nJeremy Pope\n\nNominated\n\n[24]\n\n\nBest Supporting Performance\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest First Feature\n\nElegance Bratton, Effie T.
