    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of 140 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Although it's frustratingly clumsy in certain respects, The Inspection is an affecting actors' showcase in service of some truly worthy themes.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Dieter O\u00dfwald, film correspondent for the Guild of German Film Art Theaters, writes that Bratton's impressive feature debut, which he describes as a \"queer Full Metal Jacket\", tells of a chapter of intolerance, discrimination and homophobia in the U.S., where until 2005 the official motto in the U.S. military was still \"don't ask, don't tell\" and coming out in uniform was considered unthinkable. In this context, O\u00dfwald quotes an instructor in the film: \"If we kicked all the gays out of the Army, there would be no more Marines.\" Showing such an ambivalent figure is part of the dramaturgical cleverness of the drama, which does not leave conflicts in the clich\u00e9, but deliberately presents the contradictions."
