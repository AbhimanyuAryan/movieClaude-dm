    "Plot": [
        "Children\u2019s book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Jessica is plagued by nightmares that include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear named Chauncey and forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor, Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, shares memories of Jessica's childhood that she cannot remember.",
        "Max leaves for tour and Chauncey begins to disturb Jessica. One day, Taylor invites over a friend, Liam, who is toyed with by Chauncey; the teddy briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail, prompting her to call child psychologist Dr. Soto. She discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto shows her footage of a past patient who used the same phrase as Alice: \"Never Ever\". Alice disappears, which Taylor blames her stepmother for.",
        "Gloria tells Taylor that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned. Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and the Never Ever. All three women complete Chauncey's scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm.",
        "Here, they find Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, she was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but became mad after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm, and is mauled by Chauncey. Jessica stops Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.",
        "After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben\u2019s institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to her and seeks revenge for her abandonment of him. Taylor saves her and Chauncey transforms into his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn them insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.",
        "They check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with a teddy bear that resembles Chauncey. They leave for another hotel for their safety."

    "Reception": [
        "As of April\u00a015, 2024, Imaginary has grossed $27.8\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $10.8\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $38.7\u00a0million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, Imaginary was released alongside Kung Fu Panda 4 and Cabrini, and was projected to gross $10\u201314 million from 3,118 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.6 million on its first day, including $725,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $9.9 million, finishing fifth at the box office. The film made $5.6 million in its second weekend, finishing in fourth.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 25% of 97 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Imaginary's core concept is solid enough to produce a handful of scares, but too much of its potential is lost in a clich\u00e9d story that gets bogged down in world-building.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 34 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 57% overall positive score.",
        "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called it \"a watchable mess of a child's-play fright flick, exemplifies the trend of overwrought too-muchness\" and also wrote \"despite a few creepy moments, [the film] is starved for scenes that make the fear it's showing you relatable\". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter praised Wise's and the younger's cast performances, but wrote \"Imaginary, which starts out as a relatively low-key suspenser with intriguing psychological depth, eventually succumbs to the inanities plaguing so many recent horror efforts (like the killer pool in the same company's Night Swim)\".",
        "Wilson Chapman of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \"C\", writing \"Even at its most entertaining, Imaginary has about as much staying power as the figments of imagination that give it its name. Just like your childhood imaginary friend, you'll probably forget about it pretty quickly\". Robert Abele writing for the Los Angeles Times criticized director Wadlow with being \"terrible with actors\", saying that he \"can even make a motionless plush animal seem poorly directed\". He wrote, \"Imaginary skips the directive to entertain, coming off as stiff, pedestrian and dreary as a March space-filler can get\"."
