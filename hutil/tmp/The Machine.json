Filming began in Serbia in April 2021 through Balkanic Media.\nThe Machine was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Screen Gems label on May 26, 2023.

During a night of hard partying, Bert befriends a tour guide named Igor along with his friends and is nicknamed \"The Machine\". \nTwenty-three years later, Bert is now a stand-up comedian and podcaster, having turned his story into a comedy special that goes viral on YouTube. Bert is in a tense relationship with his wife and elder daughter Sasha. While at a family cookout, Bert is unexpectedly reunited with his estranged father Albert.\nBert is then confronted by Irina, a Russian mobster. It is soon revealed that Bert inadvertently stole an antique pocket watch belonging to Irina's father, an act which led to the start of his own organized crime syndicate. Seeking revenge, Irina kidnaps Bert, along with his father, with the intention of punishing Bert for his wrongdoings, upon arrival in Russia.\n\nCast[edit]\nBert Kreischer as himself\nMark Hamill as Albert, Bert's father\nJimmy Tatro as young Bert Kreischer[5]\nIva Babi\u0107 as Irina, a mobster[6]\nRobert Maaser as Alexei, Irina's brother[5]\nStephanie Kurtzuba as LeeAnn\nMartyn Ford as Sponge\nJessica Gabor as Sasha, Bert's eldest daughter\nRita Bernard Shaw as Ashley[5]\nNikola \u0110uri\u010dko as Igor[5]\nOleg Taktarov as Train Igor[5]\nAmelie Villiers as Tatiana,[5] Bert's younger daughter\nMarko Nedeljkovic as young Igor\nAleksandar Sre\u0107kovi\u0107 as Fedor\nMercedes De La Cruz as a teacher[5]\nProduction[edit]\nIn September 2019, Legendary Entertainment acquired the rights to develop comedian Bert Kreischer's stand-up routine into a feature film adaptation following its viral success.[7] In April 2021, Peter Atencio was hired to direct and produce the film with Kreischer and Judi Marmel.[8][9][10] Kevin Biegel and Scotty Landes wrote the film.[11] Joseph Trapanese composed the film's original score.[12]\nIn April 2021, Kreischer was set to play himself and Mark Hamill was cast as Bert's father, Albert Kreischer Sr.[8] Jess Gabor was cast as Bert's daughter.[11] In May and June 2021, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Mercedes De La Cruz and Jimmy Tatro were cast in the film.[13][14][15] Principal photography took place in Serbia in April 2021.[11][15][16]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Machine was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Screen Gems label on May 26, 2023.[17][18]\nThe film was released for digital platforms on June 20, 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on August 15, 2023 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.[19]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe film was a box-office bomb.

The website's consensus reads: \"A sloppily lifeless movie that's strictly for hardcore Bert Kreischer fans, The Machine is broken beyond repair.\"[24] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 37 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[25] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a \"B+\" grade at the A+ to F scale, while PostTrak gave the film an overall 78% positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.[2][26]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Machine (15)\".
