Instead, White has offered a jumbled array of all-too-well-trod tropes and stereotypes that, all in all, can\u2019t seem to hit the mark in terms of finding the sweet spot of being \"so bad it\u2019s good\".\"[7] Writing for The New York Times, Brandon Yu felt the film \"struggles to establish a comedic rhythm\" and went on to say \"the laughs are lost within an overly long, meandering plot and scenes that miss visual polish or comedic concision\".[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Tyrrell, Caitlin (September 14, 2023). \"Michael Jai White Is A Force To Reckon With In Outlaw Johnny Black Clip [Exclusive]\".
