    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 65% of 31 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on five critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Joe Leydon of Variety wrote that the film was \"not nearly as free-wheeling and fleet-footed as Black Dynamite, the 2009 satirical comedy that cast White as a Shaft-like action hero, the new film nonetheless provides more than a few good laughs, even when it seems to be taking horse opera clich\u00e9s a tad too respectfully, and showcases a fine cast of actors dedicated to both the silliness and the seriousness of the enterprise\". RogerEbert.com's Rendy Jones gave the film a score of two and half out of four and wrote, \"Though it takes too long to get his gun out, Outlaw Johnny Black is a well-crafted and funny Spaghetti Western comedy with a refreshing goofiness and a delightful lead\".",
        "Sarah-Tai Black writing for Los Angeles Times said, \"Overall, Outlaw Johnny Black mostly seems unsure of how to navigate its Monty Python-inspired parodic impulses alongside its clear reverence for the genre. Instead, White has offered a jumbled array of all-too-well-trod tropes and stereotypes that, all in all, can\u2019t seem to hit the mark in terms of finding the sweet spot of being \"so bad it\u2019s good\".\" Writing for The New York Times, Brandon Yu felt the film \"struggles to establish a comedic rhythm\" and went on to say \"the laughs are lost within an overly long, meandering plot and scenes that miss visual polish or comedic concision\"."
