Wolfe, from a screenplay by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black, and a story by Breece about the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin.[2] Produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production company Higher Ground, the film stars Colman Domingo in the title role, alongside Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Aml Ameen, Gus Halper, CCH Pounder, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Johnny Ramey, Michael Potts, Jeffrey Wright, and Audra McDonald. It is based on the true story of Rustin, who helped Martin Luther King Jr. and others organize the 1963 March on Washington.\nRustin premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2023, and was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2023. The film received a limited theatrical release on November 3, 2023, before being released on Netflix on November 17. The film received generally positive reviews, with Domingo's performance garnering numerous accolades including nominations for the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and SAG Award for Best Actor.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis article needs an improved plot summary. Please help improve the plot summary. (February 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe film tells the story of the gay civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. Despite incredible odds, he managed to organize the March on Washington in 1963. This event is considered one of the high points of the civil rights movement in the United States. Over 200,000 people gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and called for an end to racial discrimination in the USA. Martin Luther King gave his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the event.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nColman Domingo as Bayard Rustin\nAml Ameen as Martin Luther King Jr.\nGlynn Turman as A.

Wolfe would direct a film based on the life of Bayard Rustin from a script by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black.[3] In October 2021, Colman Domingo was cast as Rustin. Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, and Audra McDonald also joined the cast.[4] Later that month, Aml Ameen, CCH Pounder, Michael Potts, Bill Irwin, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Gus Halper, Johnny Ramey, Carra Patterson, and Adrienne Warren joined the cast.[5] Production began in November 2021 in Pittsburgh.[6][7] In December 2021, Jeffrey Wright, Grantham Coleman, Lilli Kay, Jordan-Amanda Hall, Jakeem Dante Powell, Ayana Workman, Jamilah Nadege Rosemond, Jules Latimer, Maxwell Whittington-Cooper, Frank Harts and Kevin Mambo joined the cast.[8] Principal photography ended in Washington, D.C. in August, 2022. [9]\nLenny Kravitz wrote and performed an original song, \"Road to Freedom,\" for the film. On approaching Kravitz for writing a song for the film, Wolfe said, \"The one note I gave him was the song needed to help deliver us as an audience, from feeling to action. And trombones. I begged for trombones.\" Wolfe became fascinated with trombones after filming Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020), and Trombone Shorty was brought on board to contribute to the song.[10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Rustin (soundtrack)\nRelease[edit]\nRustin premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2023.[11] It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2023.[12][13] Michelle and Barack Obama introduced the film at the opening night of the HBCU First Look Film Festival at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.[14][15] The film was released in select theaters on November 3, 2023 and premiered worldwide on Netflix on November 17.[16][17]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nDomingo received near-unanimous praise for his performance and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 84% of 165 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Colman Domingo is sensational in Rustin, a stirring biopic that shines an overdue light on a remarkable legacy of public service.\"[18] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[19]\nDomingo garnered much critical acclaim for his performance in the title role.[20] John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal commended Domingo as a \"force of nature in this film, delivering a complex, highly sympathetic portrayal\" that \"determines what the movie actually is, while preventing it from going awry.\"[21] Maureen Lee Lenker elaborated, in her review for Entertainment Weekly, that \"Domingo infuses Rustin with a warmth and vibrancy that creates a performance of immense empathy\" and followed this by stating \"his portrait of a man fighting for both his race and his sexuality feels incredibly personal and helps hammer home Rustin's commitment to true 'justice for all.'\"[22] The Guardian's Benjamin Lee appreciated the film's intersectional coverage of Rustin's struggles and concluded that Domingo \"nails the charming persuasiveness that would explain how Rustin achieved so much in such a short amount of time and as he slowly starts to experience a level of acceptance for his whole self, rather than handpicked parts, there\u2019s a genuine poignancy to watching him crumble in front of us, a weight we can feel being lifted away.[23]\nOther critics were more lukewarm towards the film, in particular for its screenplay and direction. Bilge Ebiri from Vulture observed that the script was laden with \"ham-handed stage-setting with lines\" that equated to \"classroom-exercise level writing\", leading to a film that was \"filled with all the clich\u00e9s of the genre.\" He also elaborates that the film's \"predictable plot points\" and the \"pro forma\" nature of Rustin's \"personal affairs\" in conjunction with Wolfe's \"methodical direction\" led to \"visual inertia\".[24] RogerEbert.com's Robert Daniels similarly agreed that the film suffocated Domingo and suppressed his potential, noting that he \"ultimately clings to these emotional crescendos, gripping for dear life to a film that rarely, if ever, rises to his level.\"[25] In his review, Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post found the film's \"perfunctory plot\" to be \"as montage-y and as superficial as the film\u2019s opening reenactments\" and criticized the lack of character development across the supporting cast, noting \"none of them stands out as a three-dimensional character\".[26]\nSpecific criticism was further directed towards the film's approach of Rustin's sexuality as a narrative. Dustin Guastela of Jacobin criticized the film for caricaturing Rustin's political views: \"Rustin claims the civil rights hero has been forgotten because of his sexuality. But it was his fiery and provocative class politics that makes him both controversial and prophetic today.\" He argues that the film's lack of development in the relationship between Rustin and Tom Kahn \"weaponized\" Rustin's sexuality as a means to obscure that Rustin's \"historical neglect\" was also due, in part, to his political views, which were \"no less a reason for his official erasure from canonical civil rights history.\"[27] In his review for IndieWire, David Ehrlich also lamented the film's handling of Rustin's sexuality and stated that \"Rustin is diminished by the forced momentum of its plotting, by how inelegantly the script incorporates the social dynamics of Rustin\u2019s homosexuality (the love triangle that develops between Rustin, fellow activist Tom Kahn, and a composite character played by Johnny Ramey stops the movie dead in its tracks every time it comes up).\"[28]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nThe Queerties\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nNext Big Thing\n\nRustin\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\n\nHamptons International Film Festival\n\nOctober 12, 2023\n\nThe Sherzum Award\n\nWon\n\n[30]\n\n\nHeartland International Film Festival\n\nOctober 15, 2023\n\nAudience Choice Award \u2013 Narrative Special Presentation\n\nWon\n\n[31]\n\n\nMill Valley Film Festival\n\nOctober 16, 2023\n\nDirecting\n\nGeorge C.
