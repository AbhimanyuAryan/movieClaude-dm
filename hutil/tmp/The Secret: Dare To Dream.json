Directed by Andy Tennant, from a screenplay he wrote with Bekah Brunstetter and Rick Parks, it stars Katie Holmes, Josh Lucas, Jerry O'Connell, and Celia Weston.\nThe film was released in the United States through video on demand, and theatrically in several countries, on July 31, 2020, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Gravitas Ventures.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMiranda Wells is a hard-working young widow struggling to raise three children while managing in her boyfriend Tucker Middendorf's seafood restaurant in New Orleans. Bray Johnson is an engineering professor from Vanderbilt University looking to meet Miranda to deliver an envelope.\nAfter Bray misses Miranda on his first try going to her house, they inadvertently meet when she rearends his truck with her car. He offers to fix Miranda's broken bumper, so he follows her to her home, after which she invites him to stay for dinner. Until they drive back he doesn't realize she is the same Miranda he came looking for. Bray and Miranda's son Greg fix the car bumper together.\nMiranda's kids, Bess (the youngest), Greg and Missy, want pizza for dinner, which Miranda cannot afford. Bray stresses the power of positive thinking just as a delivery person appears at the door with pizza, that was ordered by Tucker. As Bray has never found the moment to give the envelope to Miranda, before departing, he leaves it in the mailbox. \nA hurricane hits that night, washing away the mailbox and causing a tree to fall through the roof. Bray comes back to check on them, sees the mailbox is missing, and offers to fix the roof as best as he can. Miranda and the kids leave with the kids' grandmother, Miranda's late husband Matt's mother Bobby, to stay over at her place while the house is fixed.\nThe next day, Tucker proposes to Miranda publicly at the restaurant's reopening, which she reluctantly accepts. Bobby offers to stay with the kids that night so Tucker and Miranda can be alone.\nThe day after, at Missy's 16th birthday party, Bobby shows Miranda a news article about an invention with Bray's photo. The invention was also something Matt was linked to. Bobby assumes that Bray stole it from her son, so Miranda confronts Bray. He explains that he and Matt were working on it together but in the fateful plane crash he died and Bray survived. He tries to explain that his sole purpose in coming was to give her a copy of the patent. Miranda doesn't believe him and asks him to leave.\nBray sends another copy of the patent to Miranda, who realizes the money from it would solve their family's problems. The family finds the old mailbox with the original copy of the patent, confirming that Bray was telling the truth. Miranda calls off her engagement with Tucker, knowing she does not truly love him, and also resigns her job at Tucker's restaurant.\nA few days later, Miranda ends up at Bray's house to clear the air and meets his sister, who exclaims that Bray has gone to Miranda's. They meet at a Waffle House, embracing with warmth and genuine affection.\nSome time later, Miranda's family is living with Bray, and Bray buys a pony for Bess.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKatie Holmes as Miranda Wells\nJosh Lucas as Bray Johnson\nJerry O'Connell as Tucker Middendorf\nCelia Weston as Bobby\nSarah Hoffmeister as Missy Wells\nAidan Brennan as Greg Wells\nChloe Lee as Bess Wells\nKatrina Begin as Jennifer\nSydney Tennant as Sloane\nCory Scott Allen as Matt Wells\nJeremy Warner as The Pizza Guy\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn August 2017, it was announced Katie Holmes had joined the cast of the film, with Andy Tennant directing from a screenplay he wrote alongside Bekah Brunstetter and Rick Parks, based on the 2006 self-help book The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.[4] The book has been translated into 50 languages and appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for 190 weeks.[5] In September 2018, Josh Lucas joined the cast of the film.[6] In November 2018, Jerry O'Connell and Celia Weston joined the cast of the film.[7]\n\nPrincipal photography began on October 30, 2018, in New Orleans.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn November 2019, Roadside Attractions and Gravitas Ventures acquired distribution rights to the film.[9] It was scheduled to be released on April 17, 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was pulled from the schedule.
