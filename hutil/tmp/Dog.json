The film stars Tatum as an Army Ranger who is tasked with escorting the military dog of his fallen friend to his funeral. The film also stars Jane Adams, Kevin Nash, Q'orianka Kilcher, Ethan Suplee, Emmy Raver-Lampman, and Nicole LaLiberte in supporting roles. The film was produced by Free Association on a budget of $15 million.[6]\nThe film was released in the United States on February 18, 2022, by United Artists Releasing. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, praising Tatum's direction and performance. It was also a box office success, grossing $85 million worldwide.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nJackson Briggs, a former U.S. Army Ranger suffering from PTSD, tries to apply for a rotation position in Pakistan, but is deemed unfit for service due to a brain injury. He is notified that his friend and former partner, Riley Rodriguez, was killed in a car accident the night before. The morning after attending a memorial service at a local bar, Briggs is called in to Fort Lewis on a special assignment to escort Riley's military dog, Lulu, a female Belgian Malinois with a history of aggressive behavior, to attend his funeral in Nogales, Arizona, after which he is to bring her to White Sands, where she will be euthanized. Initially hesitant, Briggs agrees when his former company commander, Captain Jones, promises to recommend him for the position.\nOn the road, when Briggs stops at a shooting range, Lulu breaks out of her cage and destroys the inside of his 1984 Ford Bronco. Frustrated, Briggs hides sedatives in a hot dog, causing Lulu to fall asleep after she eats it. In Portland, Oregon, Briggs tries to hit on women in a bar, but most are repelled by his brash personality. Outside, he meets two friends, Bella and Zoe, who invite him to their house for a threesome. While Briggs is inside, Lulu panics, alerting a neighbor. Believing her to be the victim of abuse, the neighbor frees her from the car, but is promptly attacked. Briggs runs outsides and pulls them apart, but Bella and Zoe are disturbed by the display and lock Briggs outside.\nThe next morning, while on the Pacific Coast Highway, Lulu climbs out of the back of the car, forcing Briggs to pull over and chase her through a nearby forest. They stumble across a marijuana farm in the woods, where Briggs is tranquilized by the farm's owner, Gus. He wakes up tied to a chair in the shed, but he is able to escape. He reunites with Lulu, who has injured her paw, and is being treated by Gus's wife, Tamara. Briggs and Gus reconcile by looking through Lulu's \"I Love Me\" book, which contains photos from her service during the War in Afghanistan. After Lulu is treated, Tamara gives Briggs a psychic reading before Briggs and Lulu continue on the road.\nIn San Francisco, Briggs cons a free hotel room by pretending to be a blind veteran, with Lulu as his seeing-eye dog. Briggs takes her to his room and gives her a bath. He tries to leave the room, but Lulu barks until Briggs relents and brings her with him. In the lobby, Lulu attacks a Middle Eastern man, Dr. Al-Farid, and Briggs is arrested for a hate crime. At the station, Briggs is put in a lineup, where he apologizes to Al-Farid, who agrees not to press charges on the condition that Briggs seek professional help for his behavior. While retrieving Lulu, the medic reveals that she has anxiety. In Los Angeles, Briggs tries to visit his estranged 3-year-old daughter, Sam, but his wife, Niki, does not allow him to. Briggs visits Noah, a former Army Ranger who adopted and rehabilitated Lulu's brother, Nuke. Noah teaches Briggs to bond with Lulu in terms she understands, allowing him to form a deeper connection with her.\nAfter leaving Noah's, the Bronco breaks down during a thunderstorm, forcing Briggs and Lulu to shelter in an abandoned barn. The next morning, Briggs and Lulu hitchhike to Nogales in time for the funeral, where Briggs stays with her to keep her calm during the traditional rifle salute. Afterwards, while Briggs gets his truck repaired, he calls Jones and tells him that Lulu's condition has improved, but Jones is unconcerned. Briggs drives into the desert and encourages Lulu to run away. When she does not, they stay in a motel overnight. Briggs suffers from a panic attack before going into a seizure, but is calmed by Lulu.\nIn the morning, Briggs drops Lulu off at White Sands, but changes his mind when he sees her panicking. He drives back to the gate and takes Lulu back, driving away with her. Months later, Briggs writes a letter addressed to her, revealing that he has adopted her. He thanks her for saving his life and making him a better man as Niki takes him to meet Sam.\n\nCast[edit]\nChanning Tatum as Jackson Briggs\nJane Adams as Tamara\nKevin Nash as Gus\nQ'orianka Kilcher as Niki\nEthan Suplee as Noah\nEmmy Raver-Lampman as Bella\nNicole LaLiberte as Zoe\nLuke Forbes as Captain Jones\nRonnie Gene Blevins as Keith\nAqueela Zoll as Callan\nJunes Zahdi as Dr. Al-Farid\nAmanda Booth as Tiffany\nCayden Boyd as Corporal Levitz\nEric Urbiztondo appears as Riley Rodriguez in photographs.[7] Lulu is played by three identical Belgian Malinois dogs named Britta, Zuza, and Lana 5, where Nuke is played by a Belgian Malinois named Sam.[8] Comedian Bill Burr makes an uncredited cameo appearance as a San Francisco police officer.[9]\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was inspired by a real road trip director Channing Tatum took with his dying dog, a pitbull mix also named Lulu, after she was diagnosed with cancer in 2018.[10] Tatum told Yahoo! News: \"When I went on my last road trip with my puppy, [I experienced] that feeling of, 'There's nothing I can do. There's nothing left to do. You just have to accept it and be thankful for the time that you did get and know that they're not supposed to be here forever. I'm supposed to go on and she has to go someplace else.\"[11] Tatum's dog died on December 19, 2018,[12] and the film is dedicated to her memory. Tatum described the filmmaking process as \"cathartic\", telling Forbes that: \"It gave me a lot of perspective on what she meant to me, what her purpose was in this life that we had together.\"[8]\nOn November 5, 2019, Tatum and Reid Carolin were announced as the directors, both to be making their directorial debuts, from a script Carolin wrote with Brett Rodriguez. Tatum and Carolin would also act as producers, alongside Peter Kiernan and Gregory Jacobs, through Tatum and Carolin's production company Free Association.[2] Tatum, Carolin, and Rodriguez previously collaborated as executive producers on War Dog: A Soldier's Best Friend (2017), an HBO documentary that explored the relationship between soldiers and their military working dogs.[13] On March 2, 2020, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired North American distribution rights to the film.[1]\nIn addition to co-directing the film, Tatum also stars in the lead role.[2] On November 15, 2019, principal photography was announced set to start in the middle of 2020.[2] It filmed in Valencia and Lancaster, California, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[14] In December 2020, Q'orianka Kilcher was added to the cast.[15] Composer Thomas Newman composed the score for Dog.[16]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on February 12, 2021, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,[1] but was pushed back to July, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[17] The date was later revealed to be July 16.[18] It was then pushed back again to February 18, 2022.[19]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nAccording to iSpot, United Artists Releasing spent $16.3 million in television spots that generated 1.17 billion impressions. The film was particularly advertised on Fox News, CBS, TLC, NBC, and ABC across programs including the Winter Olympics, the NFL, re-runs of Friends, and Hannity. According to social media firm RelishMix, social digital awareness hit 81.9 million across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram before opening. Tatum's 45.6 million followers on social media were highlighted as a significant factor in the film's box office performance.[20]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was released digitally on March 11, 2022, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on May 10, 2022, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[21] The film was released to Amazon Prime Video on September 16, 2022, 210 days after its theatrical release.[22]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nDog grossed $61.8\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $23.2\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $85\u00a0million.[4][5]\nIn the United States and Canada, Dog was released alongside Uncharted and The Cursed, and was projected to gross $6\u201311 million from 3,677 theaters in its opening weekend, and $7.5\u201314 million over the four-day Presidents' Day holiday frame.[23] The film earned $5 million on its first day, including $1.26 million from Valentine's Day (February 14) and Thursday night previews.

The website's consensus reads: \"Dog's dramatic breed is far from exotic, but solid narrative bones and well-trained work from co-director/star Channing Tatum make for a fetching viewing experience.\"[34] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 82% positive score, with 66% saying they would definitely recommend it.[20] Some critics found the film misclassified as a comedy.[36][37][38][39]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe score was composed by Thomas Newman.[16] An official soundtrack was not released with the film.[citation needed] The film contains music licensed from artists such as Kurt Vile, A Tribe Called Quest, Anderson .Paak, My Morning Jacket, Alabama Shakes, John Prine and Kenny Rogers.[40] Season Kent was credited as the music supervisor for the film and was solely responsible for selecting all the credited songs.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Fleming, Mike Jr. (March 2, 2020). \"MGM Acquires U.S. On Channing Tatum & Reid Carolin-Helmed Road Trip Tale 'Dog'\".
