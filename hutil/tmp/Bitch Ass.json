    "Plot": [
        "The plot opens with an introduction from the aforementioned Mr Todd who explains that the story of Bitch Ass was lost, and has since been recovered, and that despite what we know of Black Horror, the OG player we\u2019ve yet to meet is the titular \u2018Bitch Ass\u2019.",
        "A young boy, raised by his deeply religious Grandmother, and bullied by his peers for his love of boardgames, C\u00e9cile is given the cruel moniker \u2018Bitch Ass\u2019 by those who would torment him. Fast forward to the 1980s, and upon the death of his grandmother, a local gang of petty thieves\u2019 plan to raid the house, having forgotten about the boy they made life hell for; that is, until they stumble into his \u2018game room\u2019.",
        "The film plays out like a reverse home invasion movie, akin to something like \u2018Don\u2019t Breathe\u2019, but with the tone and pacing of a straight up slasher movie. Once the film gets going, which mercifully doesn\u2019t take too long at all, the films generic roster of would-be victims are predicably picked off one at a time, and then forced to play some distorted version of a classic boardgame with \u2018Bitch Ass\u2019, games such as connect-four and Jenga. Naturally there\u2019s a deadly twist involved, such as the collapse of the Jenga tower triggering a hangman\u2019s noose, and with connect-four, a guillotine.",
        "It makes for a very easy watch, as despite the film\u2019s runtime padded out with many impromptu flashback sequences \u2013 which ultimately lean really hard on developing its masked antagonist, indeed to the extent that the film doesn\u2019t really have a protagonist that is worth caring about.",
        "Aside from the obvious setups of Bitch Ass\u2019 \u2018games\u2019, the film has some nice visual flourishes, albeit reserved mainly for the key set pieces, such as title slides featuring some little cards of each of the characters in a beat-em-up style loading screen, as well as other comic book stylised graphics used liberally throughout. Equally, accenting the films otherwise typical visual style, are some interesting uses of split-screen, not just in the head-to-head game sequences, but also in some of the backstory sections. None of this adds any value beyond window dressing, but it just adds some visual padding to what is, in all other areas, a very generic no-budget slasher film."
