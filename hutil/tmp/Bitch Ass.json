Fast forward to the 1980s, and upon the death of his grandmother, a local gang of petty thieves\u2019 plan to raid the house, having forgotten about the boy they made life hell for; that is, until they stumble into his \u2018game room\u2019.\nThe film plays out like a reverse home invasion movie, akin to something like \u2018Don\u2019t Breathe\u2019, but with the tone and pacing of a straight up slasher movie. Once the film gets going, which mercifully doesn\u2019t take too long at all, the films generic roster of would-be victims are predicably picked off one at a time, and then forced to play some distorted version of a classic boardgame with \u2018Bitch Ass\u2019, games such as connect-four and Jenga. Naturally there\u2019s a deadly twist involved, such as the collapse of the Jenga tower triggering a hangman\u2019s noose, and with connect-four, a guillotine.\nIt makes for a very easy watch, as despite the film\u2019s runtime padded out with many impromptu flashback sequences \u2013 which ultimately lean really hard on developing its masked antagonist, indeed to the extent that the film doesn\u2019t really have a protagonist that is worth caring about.\nAside from the obvious setups of Bitch Ass\u2019 \u2018games\u2019, the film has some nice visual flourishes, albeit reserved mainly for the key set pieces, such as title slides featuring some little cards of each of the characters in a beat-em-up style loading screen, as well as other comic book stylised graphics used liberally throughout. Equally, accenting the films otherwise typical visual style, are some interesting uses of split-screen, not just in the head-to-head game sequences, but also in some of the backstory sections. None of this adds any value beyond window dressing, but it just adds some visual padding to what is, in all other areas, a very generic no-budget slasher film.\n\nCast[edit]\nTony Todd as Titus Darq\nSheaun McKinney as Spade\nTunde Laleye as Bitch Ass\nMe'lisa Sellers as Marsia Gatson\nTeon Kelley as Quentin\nA-F-R-O as Moo\nKelsey Caesar as Tuck\nBelle Guillory as Cricket\nJarvis Denman Jr. as Young Cecil\nTim J.

The website's consensus reads: \"It's more entertaining in theory than execution, but if you're looking for an amusingly cheesy slasher, Bitch Ass should just about fit the bill.\"[8]\nCarlos Aguilar of IndieWire graded the film a B\u2212 and wrote, \"Invoking an oft-overlooked canon, actor turned director Bill Posley fabricates a highly entertaining homage to the Black horror of decades past with Bitch Ass...\"[9]\nValerie Complex of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a funny, charming piece of B-horror cinema that has what it takes to stand firm among the many B-movie cult classics.\"[10]\nNick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"There's just not enough imagination or tact to make this all unsettling or fun, even though a serial killer named Bitch Ass is a good hook.\"[11]\nMeagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting and Mary Beth McAndrews of Dread Central both awarded the film a three out of five score.[12][13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Squires, John (March 15, 2022). \"'Bitch Ass' Clip \u2013 Tony Todd Plays Horror Host in the SXSW Slasher\".
