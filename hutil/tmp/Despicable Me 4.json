The trailer has 19 million views as of March 2024.[11] An additional trailer was revealed on February 11 during the Super Bowl LVIII, being narrated by Jon Hamm, who previously voiced Herb Overkill in the Minions spin-off, and featured cameos from Will Ferrell and Steve Carell. Ryan Gajewski of The Hollywood Reporter said the trailer had appeared to \"tout the benefits of modern technology but feature strange images supposedly generated by AI\", enjoying the Renaissance-era inspired pose of Ferrell and Carell in the trailer.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nDespicable Me 4 is scheduled to be released in the United States on July 3, 2024.[4]\nAs part of Universal's deal with Netflix, the film will stream on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Netflix for the next ten, and returning to Peacock for the remaining four.[13][14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Despicable Me 4\".
