It follows the life of lawyer and activist Pauli Murray.\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 31, 2021. It was released in a limited release on September 17, 2021, prior to digital streaming on Prime Video on October 1, 2021, by Amazon Studios.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nThe film follows the life of lawyer and activist Pauli Murray who was instrumental in arguing the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment outlawed discrimination based on sex.[1] Several scholars of Murray's work are featured in the film including Brittney Cooper and Rosalind Rosenberg. Rosenberg's research for the book Jane Crow: The Life of Pauli Murray is also highlighted.[2] The film includes significant coverage of Murray's papers housed at the Schlesinger library.[3] Murray's influence on Ruth Bader Ginsburg is covered in detail throughout the film.[4]\n\nDepiction of Murray's gender identity[edit]\nMy Name Is Pauli Murray features a nuanced analysis of Murray's gender identity. The film makes extensive connections between Murray's gender identity and groundbreaking feminist legal arguments.[4] Historian Rosalind Rosenberg explains in the film how a sense of \"in-betweenness\" contributed to the numerous innovative legal arguments presented by Murray with regards to race and gender.[4]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 31, 2021.[5] Shortly after, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film.[6] It also screened at AFI Docs in June 2021.[7] It was released in a limited release on September 17, 2021, prior to digital streaming on Amazon Prime Video on October 1, 2021.[8]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nCohen has been quoted as noting Murray was an \"unrecognized figure in so many areas\" and an intent behind the creation of the film was to bring Murray's story to a wider audience.[9] My Name Is Pauli Murray received positive reviews from film critics. It holds a 95% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.80/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"My Name Is Pauli Murray educates and uplifts in equal measure while paying stirring tribute to a largely unsung -- yet hugely important -- individual.\"[10]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nIt won the prestigious Peabody Award in 2022.[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Schulz, Kathryn. \"The Civil-Rights Luminary You've Never Heard Of\".
