    "Plot": [
        "Jenna is a waitress and expert pie baker at Joe's Pie Diner in the American South. She bakes pies to distract herself from her unhappiness with her home life (\"What's Inside\"). She begins another day at the diner with her boss Cal and fellow waitresses Becky and Dawn (\"Opening Up\"). After Jenna almost throws up, Becky and Dawn convince her to take a pregnancy test which, to Jenna's dismay, comes back positive due to a drunken night with her abusive husband, Earl (\"The Negative\"). Earl comes to the diner and suggests he wants to make Jenna quit and give up her passion for baking. He takes the tips she has earned from working so far that day. She decides not to tell him about her pregnancy and recalls her late mother, who also found solace from an unhappy marriage in baking (\"What Baking Can Do\").",
        "At her OB/GYN's office, Jenna is taunted by other pregnant women (\"Club Knocked Up\") and meets Dr. James \u201cJim\u201d Pomatter, a new doctor from Connecticut. Jenna explains she does not want to raise a child but does not want an abortion, and leaves Dr. Pomatter with a Mermaid Marshmallow pie, which he eats and loves (\"Pomatter Pie\").",
        "Word of Jenna's pregnancy reaches Joe, the diner's elderly owner, who suggests she enter a local pie-baking contest with a cash prize of $20,000, which would give Jenna enough money to leave Earl. Dawn begins using an online dating platform but is terrified of every outcome (\"When He Sees Me\").",
        "Jenna runs into Dr. Pomatter at the bus stop. He tells her he loved the Mermaid Marshmallow pie, saying it could \"win contests and ribbons and things\" (\"It Only Takes a Taste\"). Jenna arrives home to learn Earl has been fired from his job. He berates her, and his anger almost turns physical; out of impulse and fear, Jenna confesses she is pregnant. Earl softens up, but makes Jenna promise not to love the baby more than she loves him (\"You Will Still Be Mine\"). Jenna tells Dawn and Becky her plan to enter the pie contest; if she wins, she will use the prize money to leave Earl for a new life with the baby. The three waitresses see their dreams of a better life within reach (\"A Soft Place to Land\"). Jenna begins to give Earl only half her earnings, hiding the other half around the house in order to save up for entering the pie contest.",
        "Dawn's date, Ogie, visits the diner. Dawn believes that their first date did not go well, but Ogie insists on finding out more about Dawn and helping her overcome her anxiety (\"Never Ever Getting Rid of Me\"). Dawn and Ogie realize how much they have in common, such as their mutual enjoyment of American Revolution reenactments. Jenna makes an appointment with Dr. Pomatter, where he comes in two hours early just to see her again. Jenna confronts Dr. Pomatter, accusing him of being strange, but then she impulsively kisses him. Though both are married, they decide to escape their frustrating lives, and have sex in his office (\"Bad Idea\").",
        "After her tryst, Jenna discovers Becky and Cal making out at the diner. The married Becky is unashamed of giving in to passion (\"I Didn't Plan It\"). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair, as do Becky and Cal; Dawn and Ogie begin their relationship (\"Bad Idea (Reprise)\"). Jenna wonders if having an affair is a mistake, but Dr. Pomatter reassures her. Jenna begins writing a letter to her baby (\"You Matter to Me\").",
        "Several months pass and Dawn and Ogie marry (\"I Love You Like a Table\"). At the reception, Jenna asks if Cal, despite his affair, is truly happy; he responds that he is \"happy enough.\" Joe tells Jenna his sincere hopes for her (\"Take It from an Old Man\"). Note that post-pandemic, two lines of dialogue were added to the script. Becky asks what is the name of the Wedding Pie, and Jenna replies \"A Big Ol' Slice of Live Your Life Pie,\" in reference to the late Nick Cordero's song \"Live Your Life.\" Earl drags Jenna home and uncovers the money she has been hiding. She meekly tells him she has been saving for the baby, but Earl leaves with the money (\"Dear Baby\"). Jenna breaks down, lamenting her long-lost control over her life (\"She Used to Be Mine\").",
        "Jenna goes into labor (\"Contraction Ballet\"). She sees Joe at the hospital on his way to surgery. Joe gives Jenna an envelope, and tells her not to open it until she leaves the hospital. Earl, Becky and Dawn, and even Dr. Pomatter's wife, who is a resident at the hospital, crowd the delivery room, and Jenna cries out in distress and gives birth. She names her daughter Lulu. Earl reminds her of her promise not to love Lulu more than him, and Jenna finally tells him she wants a divorce. He reacts poorly, and she implies she will seek a restraining order against him if he ever comes near her or Lulu. Dr. Pomatter visits Jenna alone in her room, but Jenna refuses his kiss. Saying she does not want to remain \"happy enough\", she ends the affair. As thanks for his positive impact on her life, she gives him a moon pie. Jenna remarks on her change in outlook with Lulu in her life (\"Everything Changes\").",
        "Jenna opens Joe's envelope. Knowing he was dying, he left her the diner in his will and testament; Joe also wanted Jenna to \"name a pie after me when I'm gone\". Five years later, the diner has been rechristened \"Lulu's Pies\" and Jenna, the owner and head chef, is content that her life has finally turned around (\"Opening Up (Finale)\")."

        "Following the closure of the original Broadway production on January 5, 2020 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater (now the Lena Horne Theater), the theater district shut down for over a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, producer Barry Weissler announced that a remount of the original production, starring Bareilles, would open following the reopening of Broadway theaters. The show returned in a limited engagement on September 2, 2021 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, making it the first musical on Broadway to begin performances following the COVID-19 shutdown. The primary reason for its return was to record the production for a future public release, with Steam Motion and Sound producing the film. Several returning cast members star in the production, including Bareilles as Jenna, Gehling as Dr. Pomatter, Tippett as Earl, Dawson as Becky, Houlahan as Dawn, Matthews as Joe, Fitzgerald as Ogie, and Anderson as Cal. The run concluded on December 22, 2021, two weeks earlier than planned due to a spike of COVID-19. The film entered post-production the following year and was completed in early 2023."
