The website's critics consensus reads: \"Boogie misses its shot with a contrived plot and uneven tone.\"[11] According to Metacritic, which sampled 24 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".[12] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 70% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 55% saying they would definitely recommend it.[9]\nTeo Bugbee at The New York Times gave a mixed-to-positive review, writing \"It's a competent movie, but it doesn't quite make it to the big leagues\".[13] Chris Vognar for the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a \"sitting Little Man\", roughly translating to 3/5 stars, stating that it's \"refreshing to see the rare Asian American drama on the big screen, but a lot of the conflict in Boogie, on the court and off, feels undercooked.\"[14] Alison Willmore of Vulture gave a mixed-to-negative review, writing that the film's \"ideas about Asian American identity and being Chinese in America are vague\" and that \"it regards Blackness with a roiling mixture of covetousness and resentment.\"[15]\nRobert Daniels at IndieWire rated the film 'D', stating that \"Eddie Huang's coming-of-age sports drama uplifts the Asian American struggle while falling into the same othering it purports to despise\".[16]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of basketball films\nList of hood films\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b N'Duka, Amanda (August 26, 2019). \"'Fresh off the Boat' Author Eddie Huang To Make Directorial Debut With 'Boogie' Film At Focus Features\".
