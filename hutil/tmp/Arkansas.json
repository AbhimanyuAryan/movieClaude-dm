He explains that Kyle and Swin are to work under him, living on the park grounds with cover identities as park employees while they traffic drugs across the southern U.S.",
        "Swin begins dating Johnna, a nurse who brings him to a curio shop run by an eccentric owner. Kyle and Swin receive orders from a woman called \u201cHer\u201d to complete a deal in Castor, Louisiana, where they deliver product to a talkative Greek man. His grandson, Nick, follows them back to Arkansas. He assaults Bright in his home, and then tortures him for his stash of money, but both are killed in a struggle for Nick's gun. Believing they will be blamed if Frog's organization discovers what happened, Kyle and Swin bury the bodies. Kyle returns to Castor and kills the old Greek man.",

After an undetermined amount of time passes, Frog becomes dissatisfied with his share, and he calls the police on Almond in a set-up. The two amicably split after Almond is sent to prison, and Frog takes over his middleman on the condition that he kills Almond's hated ex brother-in-law and sets his sister up in a comfortable nursing home. The middleman later sells his wholesaler to Frog.",

Maintaining a cover story about Bright's disappearance, Kyle and Swin accept another order from Her in person.

Kyle sends him away, but contradicts the lies they had told Johnna.",

Years later, now operating out of a donut shop, Frog and the twins are approached by a Knoxville dealer's middleman for as much product as they can gather.

Kyle escapes after gouging out Tim's eyes, and gives Johnna the stash of money, telling her to find Swin's family in Gray, Kentucky.",
        "Frog advises Thomas to forgo revenge, but Thomas empties his joint accounts with Frog and euthanizes his blinded brother, leaving to hunt down Kyle. Burying Tim and burning his curios, Frog calls a contact and prepares to rebuild his business in Oklahoma, but is confronted by an injured Kyle.

        "On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 47% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Arkansas has an appealing low-key charm, but this character-driven neo-noir is too diffuse and derivative to leave much of an impression.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "Dennis Harvey of Variety Magazine praised actor Clark Duke, while Screen Rant gave 2 out of 5, saying that \"[It] struggles to find an internal rhythm - resulting in a laid-back crime film that suffers from flat execution, [despite] some bright spots.\" Devika Girish of The New York Times criticized the acting of Kyle by Liam Hemsworth, saying that his monologue about lacking a \"philosophy of life\" was delivered as a voice-over. The Hollywood Reporter called the film \"Underwhelming, despite a surprising abundance of talent\".",
        "It also got 3 out of 5 from the Rolling Stone and The Guardian. The A.V. Club gave it a grade B\u2212.",
        "Julian Roman of the MovieWeb said in his opening comments that \"[Arkansas] is backwards and lacks substance\", while Datebook, a subsidiary of the San Francisco Chronicle, said that \"Despite being in over their heads, [the main characters] actually have some good survival instincts\"."
