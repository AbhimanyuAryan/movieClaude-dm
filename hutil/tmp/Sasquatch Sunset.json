        "In August 2022, Jesse Eisenberg announced his involvement in the film as an actor and producer, with David Zellner and Nathan Zellner directing. He stated to Entertainment Weekly, \"In full makeup. In full body hair. No lines, I grunt, but no lines, and I'm so looking forward to this.\" Principal photography took place in Northern California in 2022.",
        "To help the cast prepare for their roles, Eisenberg brought in movement coach and mime coach Lorin Eric Salm, whom Eisenberg had trained with to play French mime artist Marcel Marceau in the feature film Resistance. Prior to filming, in what was dubbed \"Sasquatch School\"  or \"Ape Camp\", Salm worked with the actors to explore Sasquatch behavior and to establish consistent movement for the creatures so that they would all appear to be of the same species. Drawing inspiration both from primates and from Bigfoot lore, he helped them find a balance between human and ape-like movement. The work included creating a walk, learning animal behavior, developing non-verbal emotional expression, and exploring how a Sasquatch might interact with unfamiliar objects. The movement sessions also focused on nuances of daily Sasquatch life and their manner of eating, and it was during this training period when their vocalizations and forms of communication were chosen."
