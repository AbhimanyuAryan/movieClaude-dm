    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 36 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Adults finds enough profundity in grief and strained sibling bonds to overcome an occasionally aimless story, with subtly rewarding results.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Rory O'Connor graded the film B+ for The Film Stage and wrote, \"It\u2019s coarse to the touch but The Adults is a tender film.\" Steph Green reviewing for IndieWire graded the film B and wrote, \"A raw, sensitive, and true look at a family in flux with too much love to give and no tools to whittle it into something useful.\" Guy Lodge reviewing at Berlin Film Festival, for Variety wrote, \"From... queasiness comes bristly tension, tautening and deepening what otherwise seems a low-key, low-stakes character study, and eventually a sweet, conciliatory sliver of hope too.\"",
        "Conversely, Damon Wise reviewing for Deadline Hollywood criticising the film wrote, \"The Adults is a comedy-drama that doesn\u2019t seem to deliver much of either, and that gray, in-between state just isn\u2019t appealing anymore. Could it be that the cinema of awkwardness, or mumblecore in different clothes, has finally reached its sell-by date?\""
