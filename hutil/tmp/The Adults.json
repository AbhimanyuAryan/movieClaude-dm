It was invited to Horizons section of 57th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, where it was screened on 30 June 2023.[3]\nIt was released on August 18, 2023.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 36 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Adults finds enough profundity in grief and strained sibling bonds to overcome an occasionally aimless story, with subtly rewarding results.\"[5] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[6]\nRory O'Connor graded the film B+ for The Film Stage and wrote, \"It\u2019s coarse to the touch but The Adults is a tender film.\"[7] Steph Green reviewing for IndieWire graded the film B and wrote, \"A raw, sensitive, and true look at a family in flux with too much love to give and no tools to whittle it into something useful.\"[8] Guy Lodge reviewing at Berlin Film Festival, for Variety wrote, \"From... queasiness comes bristly tension, tautening and deepening what otherwise seems a low-key, low-stakes character study, and eventually a sweet, conciliatory sliver of hope too.\"[9]\nConversely, Damon Wise reviewing for Deadline Hollywood criticising the film wrote, \"The Adults is a comedy-drama that doesn\u2019t seem to deliver much of either, and that gray, in-between state just isn\u2019t appealing anymore. Could it be that the cinema of awkwardness, or mumblecore in different clothes, has finally reached its sell-by date?\"[10]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nBerlin International Film Festival\n\n26 February 2023\n\nGolden Bear Plaque\n\nThe Adults\n\nNominated\n\n[11]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Adults\".
