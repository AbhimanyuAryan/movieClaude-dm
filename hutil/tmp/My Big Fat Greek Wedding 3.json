The third installment in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding franchise, the film stars Vardalos, John Corbett, Louis Mandylor, Elena Kampouris, Gia Carides, Joey Fatone, Lainie Kazan, and Andrea Martin. It is the first entry not to star Michael Constantine (who died in 2021), Bess Meisler, and Ian Gomez. Filming took place in Athens, Greece, from June through August 2022.[4][5]\nThe film was released in the United States on September 8, 2023, by Focus Features. It received generally negative reviews from critics and has grossed $39 million worldwide.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn the wake of Gus Portokalos and Ian's father Rodney's passing a year ago, the Portokalos family is grappling with grief. Nick, now separated, returns home, displaying immature behavior. Athena and her husband Yiannis are caring for Maria, who is battling dementia. Toula and Ian, though happily married, are facing the challenges of parenthood as their daughter Paris struggles with the responsibility of college, this is completely unbeknownst to them.\nVictory, a distant relative and the mayor of Gus' hometown Vrisi, invites the family here for a supposed reunion. On the flight, Aunt Voula introduces her assistant Aristotle, Paris' college-mate, and Toula reveals she's bringing Gus' journal, containing his life story, to give to his three childhood friends in Greece as promised.\nThey arrive in Athens, where Victory greets them, and go sightseeing. In the nearly abandoned Vrisi, they find Gus' childhood home and meet Alexandra, Gus's old flame. There, Victory confesses there's no reunion, hoping the Portokaloses would revive the village. The family goes to a nearby town the following day, where Toula searches for Gus's friends without success and gets drunk on ouzo. Nick searches for the village's oldest tree and Ian befriends a monk, who possesses information about everyone's activities in the village. Meanwhile, Aristotle tries to communicate with Paris, who rebuffs his advances without explaining why.\nAt dinner, Toula and Ian meet Peter, Alexandra's son by Gus, whom the latter never knew about, as well as his son Christos, and Alexandra's assistant Qamar. Afterwards, Christos and Qamar take Aristotle and Paris to a club, where they reveal they are secretly betrothed. The next day, Toula informs her family about Peter, but struggles to locate Gus' friends. Fortunately, the monk gave Ian a list of those who left the village, pinpointing one who moved to Syros. Toula shares this with Nikki and Angelo, who head to Syros and return with them. \nMeanwhile, Toula discovers Nick brought Gus's ashes to Greece, following his father's wish for them to be scattered by the oldest tree in Vrisi. Later that evening, the family learns about Christos and Qamar's engagement, coupled with the revelation of Paris being on academic probation. Peter and Alexandra express disapproval, prompting Ian to offer intervention for Paris. However, the younger generation rejects external interference, opting to address their issues independently.\nThe next day, Peter comes to terms with Christos and Qamar's relationship, with Alexandra eventually doing the same. Victory recognizes the potential of a wedding to revitalize the village and initiates plans. Toula and Ian receive encouragement to unwind and relish their vacation while the rest of the family collaborates in organizing the wedding, albeit with their assistance in the final stages.\nIn a joyous celebration, Qamar's family joins them for her wedding to Christos. Paris opens up about her split with Aristotle, citing struggles with independence, and they agree to take things slow, much to Aunt Voula's delight. Nikki and Angelo arrive with Gus' friends, and Toula presents them with his journal. \nLater, Toula, Nick, and Peter privately scatter Gus' ashes around the tree, and Victory's mayorship receives praise. Toula and Nick decide to bring Peter with them to America, now as part of the family. The siblings, on the way, engage in a playful dispute over who should now lead the family, each citing their actions during the journey.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nNia Vardalos as Fotoula \"Toula\" Portokalos\nJohn Corbett as Ian Miller\nLouis Mandylor as Nick Portokalos\nElena Kampouris as Paris Miller\nLainie Kazan as Maria Portokalos\nAndrea Martin as Theia Voula\nGia Carides as Cousin Nikki\nJoey Fatone as Cousin Angelo\nMaria Vacratsis as Theia Freida\nElias Kacavas as Aristotle\nMelina Kotselou as Victory\nAnthi Andreopoulou as Alexandra\nAlexis Georgoulis as Peter\nGiannis Vasilottos as Christos\nStephanie Nur as Qamar\nGerry Mendicino as Uncle Taki\nStavroula Logothettis as Athena Portokalos\nKathryn Haggis as Marianthi\nJayne Eastwood as Mrs. White\nKathryn Greenwood as Marge\nTannis Burnett as Edie\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn late June 2016, Nia Vardalos hinted at the possibility of a third film, saying that she had an idea for the plot, although no writing had been done.[6] In April 2021, it was reported that My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 was in development as an independent film, written by Vardalos, who will also reprise her role as co-star.[7] As an independent film, the studio could not get insurance to begin filming amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.[8] In October 2021, Vardalos confirmed that the script for the third film had been completed and that it would involve another Greek wedding.[9] In June 2022, it was reported that Vardalos will serve as director on the third film.[10]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced in Athens, Greece, on June 22, 2022.[4] Large portions of the film were shot on Corfu from July 5 to August 3, 2022.[11] On August 10, 2022, filming officially wrapped.[5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 was released by Focus Features in the United States on September 8, 2023.[12] It was released on digital platforms on September 26, 2023, three weeks after its theatrical release.

The website's consensus reads: \"Amiable and sunny if often unamusing, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 repeats much of what audiences loved the first time around but suffers from diminishing returns.\"[16] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 35 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[17] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 73% overall positive score, with 55% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 (12A)\".
