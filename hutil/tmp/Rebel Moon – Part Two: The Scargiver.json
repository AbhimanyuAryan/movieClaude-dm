Much like its predecessor, it received generally negative reviews from critics.

This pitch was to be a more mature take on the Star Wars universe.[13]\nPart Two received over $16.6 million in tax credits from the state of California for spending over $83 million on production in the state.[14]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nThe titles for the two parts were revealed to be Part One: A Child of Fire and Part Two: The Scargiver, according to teaser trailers released at Gamescom in August 2023.[15][16] In March 2024, the official trailer was released.[17]\n\nMusic[edit]\nComposer Tom Holkenborg returns to compose the score for Part Two: The Scargiver, who served as composer for Part One: A Child of Fire. In March 2024, it was announced that a track list named \"Songs of the Rebellion\" will be released, based on the characters from the Rebel Moon universe. It features several artists, including Jessie Reyez, Tokischa, Tainy, Aespa, Tokimonsta, Black Coffee, and Kordhell. It was released on April 5, 2024.[18]\n\nRelease[edit]\nRebel Moon \u2013 Part Two: The Scargiver was released in select theaters in the United States for a week on April 12, 2024, and was released by Netflix on April 19, 2024.[19]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 16% of 50 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Less a course correction than a compounding of everything that tangled up its predecessor, The Scargiver is an uninvolving space opera full of flat notes.\"[20] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 36 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[21]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn April 2024, co-writer Kurt Johnstad announced that though original plans were for a trilogy of movies, the franchise will eventually consist of a total of six films; explaining that the stories for each original installment have been expanded into two parts. The writer stated that the treatments are completed for the third and fourth movie and Snyder is currently writing the third film.[22] On the same day, Snyder stated that the total number of films in the series will either be four or six, depending on whether or not the second and third entries of the trilogy each get split into a two-part movie as well.
