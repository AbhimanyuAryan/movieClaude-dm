        "Upon finally returning to Damon\u2019s home, Victoria is reunited with her daughter. Then Damon explains that he had no need for the money that Victoria had collected; instead, this night was a part of his plan to eliminate all of Victoria\u2019s enemies along with the corrupt Governor, thus cleaning the city of crime and corruption.",
        "As the dawn breaks, Damon lures all the corrupted cops that had been working for the Governor into his home, where he blows himself up along with them. Meanwhile, Victoria and her daughter escape safely."

        "Writing for RogerEbert.com, Peter Sobczynski described the film as \u201ca rehash of genre cliches that is so dull, threadbare, and bereft of thrills that the one time that its one moment of genuine excitement comes when our heroine enters a bar where danger is allegedly afoot, and the television in the background is showing curling\u201d and \u201cthe kind [of film] that almost makes the DTV drivel that Steven Seagal has been churning out for the last couple of decades seem focused and committed by comparison\u201d, rating it only one out of four stars."
