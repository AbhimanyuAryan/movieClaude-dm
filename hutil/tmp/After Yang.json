    "Plot": [
        "Jake and Kyra live with their adoptive daughter Mika, as well as Yang, a robotic teenage boy. Jake and Kyra bought Yang, a culture unit, as a way for Mika to connect with her Chinese heritage through sharing stories and facts. Yang becomes unresponsive one day after a family dance competition, but he is no longer under warranty because they purchased him from defunct reseller Second Siblings instead of his original manufacturer, Brothers & Sisters Incorporated. Jake, whose tea shop is struggling, seeks an affordable way to repair Yang.",
        "A local repair store, Quick Fix, runs a diagnostic and finds that Yang's computing core has malfunctioned and needs to be replaced. The technician recommends replacing Yang with an entirely new unit before his body begins to decompose, at a substantial cost. However, as Jake realizes how upset Mika is at the loss of her \"brother\", he becomes determined to save Yang out of principle, despite Kyra's suggestion that Mika could benefit from experiencing grief. In a flashback, Yang reassures a curious Mika that she is still part of the family despite being adopted.",
        "At the advice of his neighbor, George, Jake takes Yang to Russ, a backstreet technician. He offers to perform an illegal repair of Yang's core against the terms of Brothers & Sisters' user agreement. Russ discovers what he believes to be a hidden camera inside of Yang. Jake takes the \"camera\" to a museum specialist named Cleo, who tells him that it is, in fact, Yang's memory bank\u2014a device that records each unit's key experiences, which Brothers & Sisters has long denied exists in order to avoid a privacy scandal. Jake watches Yang's \"memories\", short clips from every day of his life, many of which feature an unknown young blonde woman. The next day, Jake picks Yang up from Russ and take him to Cleo, who attempts a more sophisticated repair of the core. In a flashback, Yang becomes sad about his inability to truly experience life the same way that humans do.",
        "Jake visits locations from Yang's memories to ask about the blonde woman. George's daughter reveals that the woman is Ada, a clone who was secretly visiting Yang when the rest of the family were at work and school. Ada then visits the house, and confirms Jake's suspicions that she and Yang had been in a relationship. Mika continues to struggle with Yang's life being in limbo, and Jake and Kyra decide the time has come to accept his death. They donate him to the museum, and both Mika and Ada say goodbye to his body. In a flashback, Yang and Kyra discuss the improbability of an afterlife.",
        "Jake tracks down Nancy, whom he believes to be Yang's first owner. However, she explains that she also bought Yang from Second Siblings as a refurbished unit before returning him after five days. Jake unlocks more of the memory bank to reveal Yang's true first life, in which he developed a relationship with another woman named Ada. This original Ada cared for the aging mother in Yang's first family, but later died in a car accident and was cloned. The cloned Ada tells Jake that she had been told the person in Yang's memories was her great-aunt, but that Yang never revealed this original relationship.",
        "Kyra and Jake agree that they don't want Yang's body to go on display at the museum, but that his memories must be preserved and shared, as his existence mattered to many people. That night, Mika tells Jake that she does not want to say goodbye to Yang. Jake agrees, and Mika begins to sing a song previously heard in one of Yang's memories."

    "Reception": [
        "In the United States and Canada, After Yang earned an estimated $46,872 from twenty-four theaters in its opening weekend. Internationally, the film grossed $625,282 for a worldwide total of $672,154, against a production budget of $9\u201320 million.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 235 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Although its reach occasionally exceeds its grasp, After Yang yields rich rewards for those willing to settle into its low-key wavelength.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Writing for The New York Times, Brandon Yu described the film as an existential crisis for humanity that asked the viewer to evaluate what it means to be alive. Polygon's Leo Kim stated the film considers many issues, including \"a testament on loss, an examination of our reliance on technology, and a deeply human story about care\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote the characters in the film live in a \"soft techno-fascism of petty pleasures and alluring surfaces that Kogonada boldly, slyly renders appealing.\" David Sims from The Atlantic wrote the film asked what it means to be human in a world filled with technology, and that \"the result is a pensive drama that plays like a quiet mystery, seeking to understand not just its human protagonist but the deeper underpinnings of all social connections.\"",
        "In 2023, IndieWire ranked it at number 9 on its list of \"The 55 Best Science Fiction Films of the 21st Century,\" with Christian Zilko writing \"While films about humans having close relationships with AI once seemed dystopian, the technology\u2019s seeming inevitability has created a need for more empathetic art about the subject. Kogonada fills that void with a beautifully subtle touch, resulting in a film that feels just as human as the \"technosapiens\" in it. Collider ranked it at number 19 on its list of the \"20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing \"While there have been countless science fiction films about the dangers of artificial intelligence (and for good reason), After Yang takes a more heartfelt approach by examining how the inclusion of a robotic child impacts a family\" and that the film \"feels surprisingly realistic in its depiction of having difficult conversations with loved ones.\""
