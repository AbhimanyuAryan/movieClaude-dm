        "In October 2021, Bruce Willis signed on to star in an action film under the working title Christmas Knight, from writer-director Edward John Drake, for a back-to-back production with Devil's Knight in Vancouver, Canada, from November 17 to December 14, 2021. Filming had wrapped by January 9, 2022, while Trevor Gretzky was confirmed to have reprised his role for both films. By September 2022, Christmas Knight was retitled to Detective Knight: Redemption, and set a December 9, 2022 release date. By November 2022, Lochlyn Munro, Corey Large, Miranda Edwards, and Beau Mirchoff, were set to reprise their roles from the first film, while John Cassini, Jerry Yu, and Paul Johansson were added to the cast. Detective Knight: Redemption is one of the last films to star Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia."

    "Release": [
        "Detective Knight: Redemption was released by Lionsgate in limited theaters and VOD on December 9, 2022, followed by its release on DVD and Blu-ray on January 17, 2023.",
        "As of January 15, 2023, Detective Knight: Redemption grossed $192,939 in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 9 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.3/10.",
        "Roger Moore, of Movie Nation, gave the film a 1.5/4 rating, summarizing that \"one just hopes the once and future John McClane was well-compensated, and that his retirement is as comfortable as he's earned, even if this is nobody's idea of \"Redemption\"\". Brian Orndorf, of Blu-ray.com, gave the film a \"D\", writing the film was \"just as dull and pointless as Rogue, adding another chapter to a shapeless, directionless saga jammed through the production process to take advantage of Willis's diminishing marquee value\". Jeffrey Anderson, of Common Sense Media, gave the film a 2/5 rating, saying \"the second movie in Willis' farewell action trilogy features even less of its star player this time, and while the tricks and cheats used to film around him sometimes work, they too often don't\".",
        "In a positive review, Film Threat writer Jason Delgado gave the film a 6/10 rating, summarizing that \"Willis is the action hero in Detective Knight: Redemption, which should be reason enough for his fans to see it\". Evan Dossey, of Midwest Film Journal, also gave the film a positive review, saying the film is \"a suitably entertaining crime caper, as long as you know what to expect going in.\""
