    "Plot": [
        "In 1962, Boston Record American reporter Loretta McLaughlin investigates three cases of older women who were raped and murdered by strangulation in the Boston area. She confirms the victims all had stockings tied around their necks in a bow, probably connecting the crimes to a serial killer. The story angers Boston law enforcement as well as Loretta's boss, who plans to kill the report to protect the company.",
        "When a fourth victim is found, Loretta and fellow reporter Jean Cole decide to continue the investigation. The two women endure rampant sexism in their workplace and society. Loretta's marriage is strained by her long hours and her family is harassed. While writing the articles, Loretta coins the name \"the Boston Strangler\".",
        "One year later, a seventh woman named Sophie Clark is murdered. A neighbor encountered a man who could be the killer and she provides a vague description. Sophie was much younger than previous victims, which breaks the Strangler's pattern. Loretta and Jean later discover that the Boston Police Department is botching the investigation and not sharing information with other cities. Similar murders, like one committed in New York City by a man named Paul Dempsey, have been overlooked.",
        "Albert DeSalvo, a suspect in the investigation, is taken into custody. Sophie's neighbor is asked to identify him in a line-up but she picks a different man, George Nassar. Despite this, in 1964, DeSalvo confesses to all 13 murders. Police do not have enough evidence to tie him to the murders, so he is instead convicted for earlier crimes of robbery and sexual offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.",
        "By 1965, Loretta learns from a police detective in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that there have been six murders there that are identical to the Boston Strangler's work. She travels to Ann Arbor and learns the most likely suspect is Daniel Marsh, an ex-boyfriend of a Strangler victim. Marsh is later arrested but refuses to cooperate with police. In 1973, DeSalvo calls Loretta and tells her to come to visiting hours the next day to hear his side of the story. Before Loretta can meet with him, he is stabbed to death by another prisoner.",
        "Following an anonymous tip, Loretta meets with Harrison, a former patient at Bridgewater State Hospital. He reveals that DeSalvo, Marsh and Nassar were all held in the same ward at the same time. Harrison also claims DeSalvo's confession was coached by Marsh and Nassar. Loretta visits Nassar in prison. He denies that he and Marsh coached DeSalvo but admits he hoped to claim the reward. He accuses Loretta and the media of creating a sensation around the Strangler and insinuates that there is more than one murderer but that the public does not want to come to terms with it.",
        "Loretta and Jean create a theory that Paul Dempsey killed the first six older women in Boston before he moved to New York. Once Dempsey left Boston, copycat murders arose, resulting in the later victims being much younger. DeSalvo confessed to all 13 murders so Nassar could collect a $10,000 reward per victim. In return, Nassar arranged for DeSalvo to be represented by high-profile lawyer F. Lee Bailey. DeSalvo was also deceived into believing he would get a million-dollar book deal that could support his family. The Record American publishes Loretta and Jean's theory.",
        "An epilogue tells of Loretta becoming an award-winning medical reporter at The Boston Globe. Jean continued working as an investigative reporter for 30 years. She and Loretta remained close friends. Marsh was never charged with murder. Nassar never received a reward and is incorrectly said to still be in prison as of 2023. In 2013, DNA evidence linked DeSalvo to the 13th murder but not the other 12."

        "Ben Kutchins served as the film's cinematographer. Filming began on December 6, 2021. A house in Belmont, Massachusetts, stood in for the home of reporter Loretta McLaughlin. That same day, the Winn Brook Elementary School was transformed into the Cambridge Police Department for second unit filming. The school was paid $5,000 to be in the film. Several private driveways on Statler and Waterhouse Roads were rented to park 1960s vehicles. For the next two days, filming took place in the South End; scenes were shot on Dwight Street between Tremont Street and Shawmut Avenue.",
        "On December 9, the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology was temporarily turned into a police headquarters for the film. Between January 26 and 27, 2022, the former Josephine M. Foster Elementary School in Braintree was used as a set. Filming also took place in Jamaica Plain, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, Roxbury, and Wellesley, Massachusetts. Several health procedures had to be followed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The entire crew was vaccinated and tested for the virus three times a week until production concluded. Filming wrapped in March 2022. During post-production, Paul Leonard-Morgan composed the musical score."

    "Reception": [
        "According to Whip Media's TV Time, Boston Strangler was the third most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week of March 19, 2023. According to the streaming aggregator Reelgood, Boston Strangler was the eighth most streamed program across all platforms, during the week of March 23, 2023.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 68% of 138 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Boston Strangler is nowhere near as gripping as it should be, but the worthy story and strong cast are often adequate compensation.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Kevin Slane writing for Boston.com praised Keira Knightley's performance, asserting, \"Knightley is perfect in the role of McLaughlin, able to convey her dogged determination with a single steely glance.\" Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave Boston Strangler a grade of two and a half out of four stars, saying, \"Boston Strangler reaches a point in which it is totally controlled by the wild course of events it is recreating, and it does make for decent, unsettling twists in a third act based on truth. But the emotional resonance is scant, even for how Boston Strangler casts another spotlight on game-changing Boston journalism. By the end, even Knightley only has so much space to construct a distinct arc from a dedication that lasted years and altered Loretta's personal life. Ruskin succeeds in paying tribute to Loretta McLaughlin and Jean Cole's hard work, but it's less successful in filling in the larger story.\"",
        "Several reviewers made unfavorable comparisons to the earlier The Boston Strangler (1968) or David Fincher's Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film a grade of two out of five stars, writing, \"A director like Jonathan Demme or David Fincher would have gone for the jugular on this kind of material, but writer-director Matt Ruskin seems a little squeamish and keeps everything on the right side of contemporary taste. The chill of fear is missing.\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times stated, \"Despite the film's flaccid gestures toward the sexism of the period\u2014to boost sales, the women's pictures are added to their bylines\u2014\"Boston Strangler\" is a dreary, painfully stylized slog.\""
