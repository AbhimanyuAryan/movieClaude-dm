Pictures, Netflix and Amazon Studios (now called Amazon MGM Studios).[3] Production began in New York City in January 2023, with Amy Ryan joining the cast.[4] Larkin Seiple serves as cinematographer, with the film titled Wolves.[5][6] In February, Austin Abrams and Poorna Jagannathan were added to the cast.[7][8]\nPrincipal photography began in early January 2023 in New York City.[9]  Clooney and Pitt filmed scenes in Harlem and Chinatown.[10][11] Filming was suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nFollowing their partnership on Napoleon, Apple entered another agreement with Sony Pictures Releasing to distribute the film in theatres.[13] It is scheduled to be released in the United States on September 20, 2024.[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ D'Alessandro, Anthony (December 13, 2023). \"Sony Wins Global Theatrical Distribution Deal For Apple's George Clooney & Brad Pitt Pic 'Wolfs' & Scarlett Johansson & Channing Tatum's 'Project Artemis'\".
