        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 27 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Manuel Betancourt of Variety wrote, \"If the film never quite finds a way to marry its high concept premise, its twee romance, and its family melodrama into one cohesive narrative, it is not for lack of trying.\" Robert Abele of TheWrap wrote, \"That\u2019s a compelling set-up for a knotty family story, but not as evidenced by the surface cutes that keep real feeling at bay in this curiously uninvolving directorial effort from Kyra Sedgwick.\" In a positive review, Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com wrote, \"[The film] isn\u2019t an overly cinematic viewing experience, but it has deep feeling for its characters and an unusual approach to the trials of grief, going in compelling directions as the whole thing works hard to avoid becoming a melodrama.\""
