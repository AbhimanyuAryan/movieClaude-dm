It tells the story of a family who comes across a box of magical animal crackers that turns anyone that consumes a cracker into the animal that the cracker represents and this animal handily saves the circus that the family was associated with.\nThe film premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 12, 2017. It was released in China on July 21, 2018.[3] It was released on Netflix on July 24, 2020, to mixed-to-positive reviews from critics.[5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1962, brothers \"Buffalo\" Bob and Horatio Huntington run a traveling circus together, doing well in spite of their vastly different personalities. After a show, the circus' resident gypsy fortune teller Esmerelda presents her beautiful niece Talia to her employers, asking them to give her a job. Bob and Horatio are both immediately smitten with the lovely woman, but her affections are solely for Bob.\nWhen the pair announce their plans to marry in 1964, Horatio becomes furious and delivers an ultimatum to his brother to choose either him or Talia. Bob marries Talia and Esmerelda gives them a mysterious box as a wedding gift, which allows them to open a new circus. Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus, known for animals performing amazing and seemingly impossible feats.\nYears later, Bob's nephew Owen marries his childhood friend Zoe at the circus where they had first met as kids. Following the initial excitement however, Owen soon discovers he now has to work as a taste tester for Zoe's father Mr. Woodley at his dog biscuit factory. His co-worker Binkley is trying to create a new type of dog biscuit which keeps getting ruined by Mr. Woodley's personal assistant Brock.\nA few years later, Horatio, whose luck has taken a serious downturn since his fight and split with Bob, sneaks into Bob and Talia's dressing rooms, trying to find the secret to the magic animals, and accidentally starts a fire which apparently kills Bob and Talia. Their funeral is attended by Owen, Zoe, and their daughter Mackenzie. Horatio makes an unexpected visit and announces that he'll be taking over the circus. Huntington and his henchmen Mario Zucchini, Samson, Stabby, and El Diablo start a fight, causing the Huntingtons to leave.\nBefore they leave, circus pets Old Blue and Zena give the Huntingtons the mysterious box, they later discover it holds animal crackers. Owen eats one and turns into a hamster. The Huntingtons return to the circus to figure out how this happened. They learn from the clown Chesterfield that the animal crackers will turn the user into the animal they eat, but it contains only one human cookie to change them back. Later, he tells them they inherited the circus. Zoe is excited, but Owen, determined to please Mr. Woodley, decides to continue his job. Zoe restores the circus while Owen stays at the dog biscuit factory. Frustrated that Zoe quit her job, Mr. Woodley begins to consider Brock as her replacement.\nBuffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus reopens, but is a disaster upon the discovery of no animals. Owen reluctantly decides to eat the animal crackers and performs stunts as an animal. By the end of the day, Owen grows to like it and decides to quit his job. As his finishes packing up though, Brock unwittingly eats one of the cookies and turns into a mandrill. To catch up with him, Owen turns into a lion, but Brock gets captured by Mario Zucchini, who also steals cookie pieces. Upon returning home, Owen soon discovers he has lost the human cookie and will remain an animal forever. He attempts to adapt to life as a different animal, but has little success. Binkley discovers the animal crackers and aggressively persuades Mr. Woodley to attend the circus.\nAt one performance, Horatio appears and offers Owen's gorilla form his human cookie (which Mario had also unknowingly stolen) in exchange for the circus. Owen refuses, thinking that remaining an animal will at least keep his family together, but he is forced into the deal by Horatio's hybridized henchmen as they help Horatio force-feed him the human cookie. The circus performers then come across the scene and a fight breaks out, with some of them assuming animal forms to fight.\nAs his henchmen are defeated, Horatio eats some crackers and turns into a six-limbed chimera. He then is confronted by Old Blue and Zena who reveal themselves as Bob and Talia, alive but forever trapped in animal form due to the destruction of their human cookies in the fire. They ask Horatio to redeem himself, but he refuses despite being horrified with what happened. Horatio flies up while grasping them. Owen uses Bullet Man in his rhinoceros form to shoot down Horatio as he, Horatio and Bob land in the net while Mackenzie turns into a Golden snub-nosed monkey to save Talia. Afterwards, Owen, Zoe, and Mackenzie, and the circus performers work together to subdue Horatio. As Horatio vows to have his revenge, Owen turns him into a hamster as Bullet Man quotes In Memoriam A.H.H. from Alfred Lord Tennyson.\nAs the circus performers, Zoe, and Mackenzie regain their human forms, Chesterfield gleefully tells the caged henchmen that their human cookies are broken as a side-effect of eating the broken pieces and it will take him awhile to figure out whose parts go to whom. Mario subsequently tells Chesterfield to take his time with the others in agreement. Horatio demands to be released from his hamster cage to no avail as he starts running on a hamster wheel.\nHaving witnessed the performance and Brock still being in mandrill form, Mr. Woodley reevaluates his views on both Owen and the circus. With Binkley, he decides to create a new circus souvenir using her failed experiments. By the next show, they have made animal crackers that cause the eater's skin to temporarily take on the color and patterns of the animal whose cracker they eat. Owen consumes a new animal cracker that just appeared in the box and takes the stage as a dragon.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJohn Krasinski as Owen Huntington, MacKenzie's father, Zoe's husband, Talia\u2019s step-nephew, Horatio and Buffalo Bob's nephew and the circus owner.[6]\nBrendan Sava portrays young Owen.[7]\nEmily Blunt as Zoe Huntington, MacKenzie's mother, Owen's wife, Talia\u2019s stepniece-in-law, Horatio and Buffalo Bob's niece-in-law.[6][8]\nNoelle Ellison Thomason portrays young Zoe.\nDanny DeVito as Chesterfield, the circus's funniest clown who had gotten fat from the foods that he ate.[9][10]\nIan McKellen as Horatio P.

In June 2013, Harvey Weinstein had seen a short film of the screenplay made by Sava[20] and two months later the Weinstein brothers made an offer to buy the rights to Animal Crackers.[21] Sava co-directed the movie with Tony Bancroft and co-wrote the screenplay with Dean Lorey.[21]\nFinancing the movie were executive producers Mu Yedong on behalf of Wen Hua Dongrun Investment Co., La Peikang, board chairman of China Film Co., and Sam Chi for Landmark Asia.[22]\nDespicable Me character designer, Carter Goodrich, was hired in October 2014.[23]\n\nPre-production[edit]\nThe voice cast was completed by casting director Jamie Thomason who also serves as the voice director.[9]\nIn the last week of October and throughout November, 2014, Sava via the Animal Crackers Facebook page, there were sneak peeks to the look of some characters along with announcing the voice cast for those characters Kevin Grevioux as Samson the Strong Man,[18] James Arnold Taylor as Buffalo Bob,[17] Tara Strong as Talia,[16] Harvey Fierstein as Esmerelda the Fortune Teller,[14] Gilbert Gottfried as Mario Zucchini,[15] and Raven-Symon\u00e9 as Binkley.[12]\nOn November 6, 2014, Blue Dream Studios announced Sylvester Stallone, Danny DeVito, and Ian McKellen as lead voice cast.[9] On February 3, 2015, John Krasinski and Kaley Cuoco joined the cast as Owen and Zoe Huntington, respectively.[6] On March 30, 2015, Emily Blunt replaced Cuoco due to a scheduling conflict.[8]\n\"When I was writing Animal Crackers I had specific voices in my head. Certain characters I wrote with actors in mind. Horatio was always Sir Ian McKellen. Brock was totally Patrick Warburton. Bullet-Man could be no one else but Stallone! To find out that each and every one of these actors have agreed to come on board this film and bring these characters to life\u2026 I'm flipping out,\" said Sava.[9]\nIt was announced via Sava's Facebook page that his son, Brendan, would play 12-year-old Owen Huntington and his wife, Donna, would play the Fat Lady.[citation needed] On May 22, 2015, it was revealed that Wallace Shawn had been cast as Mr. Woodley, Zoe's (Blunt) father.[13]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nThe film's animation is created on Autodesk Maya, and rendered on Arnold, in an effort to save costs, it was produced in Blue Dream Studios Spain an 5,000-square foot house Valencia that the director Sava founded In early 2014, more than 120 animators worked on the film.\n\nFilming[edit]\nOn January 27, 2015, Sava announced on Facebook via the Animal Crackers page that first day of \"studio sessions with the actors\" began in Los Angeles.[6]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe film's original score was composed by Bear McCreary,[1] and its soundtrack includes original songs by Toad the Wet Sprocket, Huey Lewis and the News, Howard Jones, and Michael Bubl\u00e9.[24]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nAnimal Crackers: Original Motion Picture SoundtrackSoundtrack album by Various artistsReleasedJuly 17, 2020Recorded2015-2016GenreFilm soundtrackLength46:25LabelSony Masterworks\nTrack listingNo.TitleMusicLength1.\"Welcome\" (John Adair version)Ian McKellen2:082.\"While We're Young\"Huey Lewis and the News3:403.\"Like That\"Fleur East3:084.\"The Tractor\"Chris McDougall, Leslie Austin, Dayan Kai2:395.\"Master of the Ring\"Connor Clark2:506.\"Could've Been Mine\"Ian McKellen, Gilbert Gottfried2:097.\"We're in This Together\"Howard Jones4:528.\"Don't Stop Me Now\" (2011 remaster)Queen3:129.\"One of Those Days\"Toad the Wet Sprocket2:4210.\"Today (Is Yesterday's Tomorrow)\"Michael Bubl\u00e93:2211.\"Lost and Found\"Katie Herzig4:4312.\"Animal Crackers Overture\"Bear McCreary5:2213.\"Papa Bear\"Bear McCreary2:5714.\"Showtime\"Bear McCreary2:23Total length:46:25\nScore[edit]\nAnimal Crackers: Original Motion Picture ScoreFilm score by Bear McCrearyReleasedJuly 17, 2020Recorded2017GenreScoreLength1:14:03LabelSony ClassicalBear McCreary chronology\n\n\nFantasy Island: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack(2020)\n\nAnimal Crackers: Original Motion Picture Score(2020)\n\n\n\nAll tracks written and composed by Bear McCreary. \n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLength1.\"Animal Crackers Overture\" (Extended Version)5:512.\"The Huntington Brothers\"3:283.\"Life at the Circus\"3:594.\"The Dog Food Factory\"4:545.\"News of the Fire\"1:456.\"Circus Memorial\"3:587.\"Holy Moly\"2:358.\"Zucchini Chase\"4:169.\"Little Cookie Me\"3:2210.\"The Magic Is Gone\"3:0111.\"Brock and Woodley\"3:4312.\"Papa Bear\" (Extended Version)3:1313.\"A Helping Hoof\"1:5814.\"The Tiger\"3:1415.\"Monkeying Around\"3:5816.\"An Offer From Horatio\"3:4017.\"Freak Fight\"3:5418.\"Chimera\"5:5719.\"Showtime\" (Extended Version)6:40Total length:1:12:58\nBonus tracksNo.TitleLength20.\"Fanfare for Bulletman\"0:4521.\"Blue Dream Studios Logo\"0:20Total length:1:14:03\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere in competition at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 12, 2017.[25][26] The film was originally set to be released on April 28, 2017 by Relativity Media, however, a financial crisis within the company prevented them from releasing the film. It was then set to be released on September 1, 2017 by upstart film studio Serafini Releasing before they also shut down.[27] A few months later, in November 2017, it was announced that Entertainment Studios would distribute the film worldwide. In April, Sava posted on Facebook that the film was set for a release date of August 10, 2018.[28] The deal with Entertainment Studios was dropped in June 2018.[29]\nEventually, the distribution rights were bought by Netflix and the film was released on July 24, 2020 on the platform.[30][5] It was the second-most streamed film on its opening weekend.[31]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was released on digital and on-demand on April 18, 2023 by Lionsgate and Gravitas Ventures.[32] Allied Vaughn would later release the film on DVD and Blu-Ray on October 3, 2023.[33] These releases were not authenticated or approved by director Scott Christian Sava, and are presumed to be licensed through investor Mayday Productions or another unknown outside entity.[34]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. It had a critical consensus which read: \"Animal Crackers is far from the most distinctive animated fare, but its wacky humor and zippy speed make it a decent diversion for younger viewers.\"[35] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 5 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[36]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Bear McCreary to Score 'Animal Crackers'\".
