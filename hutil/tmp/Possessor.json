It stars Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott, with Rossif Sutherland, Tuppence Middleton, Sean Bean, and Jennifer Jason Leigh in supporting roles. Riseborough portrays an assassin who performs her assignments through possessing the bodies of other individuals, but finds herself fighting to control the body of her current host (Abbott).\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020, and was released in the United States and Canada on October 2, 2020, by Neon and Elevation Pictures, while Signature Entertainment distributed the United Kingdom release on November 27, 2020. It received positive reviews, with praise for its originality and Riseborough and Abbott's performances.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn an alternate 2008, Tasya Vos is an assassin who takes control of others' bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos can use a special machine to insert her consciousness into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of each job.\nDue to the amount of time she spends imitating other people, Vos struggles with increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, Michael, and son, Ira. She \"practices\" assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael.\nVos' handler, retired assassin Girder, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it.\nDespite her fragile mental state and fatigue, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO John Parse and his daughter, Ava, by possessing Ava's fianc\u00e9, Colin Tate. The hit is only a partial success as Ava dies, but not Parse. Vos attempts to flee the scene by forcing Tate to shoot himself but discovers she cannot make him pull the trigger.\nTate instead stabs himself in the skull in an act of rebellion, damaging his implant. Vos discovers she cannot leave Tate's body or overpower his will. Tate regains control, but he does not understand why he killed his girlfriend or why he has begun to experience fragmented memories of another person's\u2014Vos'\u2014life.\nThe traumatized and disoriented Tate flees from the crime scene to his friend Reeta's apartment. He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava. Eddie, another employee from Vos's company, arrives at the apartment to help Vos regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails and Tate kills Eddie. Tate becomes aware of Vos' presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child and home.\nTate goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. Vos appears and goads Tate into killing Michael so that she can be freed of her personal attachments. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver. Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, killing him. Vos uses Tate's last moments to shoot Ira dead.\nVos returns to her own body and discovers Girder had taken control of Ira to end her struggle with Tate. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, as Girder wanted.\nIn another debriefing, Vos sorts through the same personal objects from the beginning of the film. She handles the butterfly again, but does not express any guilt for killing it. Girder smiles and replies, \"Very good.\"\n\nCast[edit]\nAndrea Riseborough as Tasya Vos\nChristopher Abbott as Colin Tate\nJennifer Jason Leigh as Girder\nSean Bean as John Parse\nRossif Sutherland as Michael Vos\nTuppence Middleton as Ava Parse\nKaniehtiio Horn as Reeta\nRaoul Bhaneja as Eddie\nGage Graham-Arbuthnot as Ira Vos\nRachael Crawford as Dr. Melis\nHrant Alianak as Lead Technician\nGabrielle Graham as Holly Bergman\nProduction[edit]\nIn May 2018, it was announced Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott had joined the cast of the film, with Brandon Cronenberg directing from a screenplay he wrote. Fraser Ash, Niv Fichman, Kevin Krikst, and Andrew Starke produced the film under their Rhombus Media and Rook Films banners. The film was also produced by Telefilm Canada, with Elevation Pictures distributing the film in Canada.[6] In February 2019, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stacy Martin and Sean Bean joined the cast of the film.[7] In May 2019, Tuppence Middleton joined the cast of the film, replacing Martin.[8]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on April 9, 2019 and concluded on May 14, in Ontario, Canada.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn November 2018, Well Go USA Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film.[10] The film later had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020.[1][11] Shortly after, Neon acquired distribution rights to the film, with Well Go USA only handling the film's home media release.[12] It was released in the United States and Canada on October 2, 2020.[13][14] The film was released in the United Kingdom on November 27, 2020, by Signature Entertainment.[15][16]\nOn May 31, 2023, it was announced that Possessor and Cronenberg's 2023 film Infinity Pool would receive a double feature in three North American theaters in June, with Cronenberg in attendance. The first for both films to theatrically screen in their uncut form, the screenings took place at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in San Francisco on the 20th, the Aero Theatre in Los Angeles on the 21st via American Cinematheque, and the Metrograph in New York City on the 23rd.[17]\n\nReception[edit]\nCronenberg's direction received praise\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 224 critic ratings are positive for Possessor, and the average rating is 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Further refining his provocative vision, writer-director Brandon Cronenberg uses Possessor's potentially over-the-top premise as a delivery mechanism for stylishly disturbing thrills.\"[18] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[19]\nThe film received a positive review by David Sims in The Atlantic, who wrote: \"Cronenberg isn't just looking to provoke with blood and guts\u2014like all good dystopian fiction, Possessor offers disturbing and timely observations about the world we already live in.\"[20] It was a New York Times Critic's Pick, with Glenn Kenny praising the film's formal sophistication.[21]\nThe film's opening sequence was singled out for praise, particularly Gabrielle Graham's performance as Holly in the sequence. David Ehrlich from IndieWire called it \"a coldly compelling prologue\"; and Wendy Ide from Screen Daily agreed: \"In a memorable cameo role in the film\u2019s opening, Gabrielle Graham also makes an impact.\"[22][23]\nMeagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting gave the film a score of four-and-a-half out of five, writing: \"Like dad David Cronenberg, Brandon Cronenberg has a unique way of testing the boundaries of comfort and exploring the human mind and body in squeamish fashion.\"[24] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's direction, visuals, as well as its performances, and special effects.[5] Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects gave the film a positive review, writing: \"While Possessor retains his family's love of body horror and morally misused electronics it also manages an engrossing pace, engaging characters, unrelentingly brutal violence, erect penises, a must-own Halloween mask, a mean-spirited Sean Bean, one hell of an ending, and more.... All of it, though, is fantastically and cruelly unforgettable.\"[25] Chris Evangelista of Slashfilm gave the film ten out of ten, writing: \"Bathed in blood and gore, and unrelentingly aggressive, Brandon Cronenberg\u2018s Possessor is unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. It is a singular work \u2013 one so ghastly, so unique, and so brutal that it will awe some and disgust others.\"[26]\nJoBlo.com's Chris Bumbray gave the film a score of eight out of ten, stating that the film \"recalls many of his father David Cronenberg's previous works\", Bunbray further praised Abbott and Riseborough's performances, as well as similar praise towards the film's visual style.[27] David Ehrlich from IndieWire also gave the film a grade of \"B\u2212\", praising Cronenberg's direction as well as the film's cinematography, visuals, and performances, while also stating it did not fully realize its potential.[22]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nPossessor won the awards for Best Feature Length Film and Best Direction at the Sitges Film Festival in 2020.[28] It was also given the Grand Prize at the 2021 G\u00e9rardmer Film Festival, where Jim Williams won for Original Score.[29] The film received three nominations at the inaugural Critics' Choice Super Awards in the Science Fiction/Fantasy category, for Best Movie, Best Actor, and Best Actress.[30] It was named to the Toronto International Film Festival's year-end Canada's Top Ten list for feature films.[31] Special makeup effects artist Dan Martin won the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for best makeup effects.[32] The film won the Golden Monster Award for Best Feature Film, as well as Best Director at the 2020 Monster Fest in Australia.\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2020\n\nSitges Film Festival\n\nBest Feature Length Film\n\nPossessor\n\nWon\n\n[28]\n\n\nBest Direction\n\nBrandon Cronenberg\n\nWon\n\n\nMonster Fest\n\nGolden Monster Award for Best Feature Film\n\nPossessor\n\nWon\n\n[33]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nBrandon Cronenberg\n\nWon\n\n\nSundance Film Festival\n\nWorld Cinema Dramatic Competition\n\nPossessor\n\nNominated\n\n[34]\n\n\nSt. Louis Film Critics Association Awards\n\nBest Horror Film\n\nPossessor: Uncut\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nIndiana Film Journalists Association\n\nBest Film\n\nPossessor\n\nNominated\n\n[36]\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nBrandon Cronenberg\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Director\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nChristopher Abbott\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Musical Score\n\nJim Williams\n\nNominated\n\n\nOriginal Vision\n\nPossessor\n\nNominated\n\n\n2021\n\nG\u00e9rardmer Film Festival\n\nGrand Prize\n\nPossessor\n\nWon\n\n[29][37]\n\n\nBest Original Score\n\nJim Williams\n\nWon\n\n\nCritics' Choice Super Awards\n\nBest Science Fiction/Fantasy Movie\n\nPossessor\n\nNominated\n\n[30]\n\n\nBest Actor in a Science Fiction/Fantasy Movie\n\nChristopher Abbott\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress in a Science Fiction/Fantasy Movie\n\nAndrea Riseborough\n\nNominated\n\n\nFangoria Chainsaw Awards\n\nBest Makeup Effects\n\nDan Martin\n\nWon\n\n[32][38]\n\n\nBest Limited Release Movie\n\nPossessor\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Score\n\nJim Williams\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Lead Performance\n\nAndrea Riseborough\n\nNominated\n\n\n46th Saturn Awards\n\nBest Independent Film\n\nPossessor\n\nNominated\n\n[39][40]\n\n\nVancouver Film Critics Circle\n\nBest Canadian Film\n\nNominated\n\n[41]\n\n\nBest Director of a Canadian Film\n\nBrandon Cronenberg\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Screenplay for a Canadian Film\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress in a Canadian Film\n\nAndrea Riseborough\n\nNominated\n\n\nVancouver Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Canadian Film\n\nChristopher Abbott\n\nWon\n\n\nVancouver Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Canadian Film\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh\n\nNominated\n\n\nCanadian Screen Awards\n\nBest Achievement in Direction\n\nBrandon Cronenberg\n\nNominated\n\n[42]\n\n\nBest Achievement in Makeup\n\nTraci Loader, Dan Martin & Dorota Mitoraj\n\nNominated\n\n\nDetroit Film Critics Society\n\nBest Actor\n\nChristopher Abbott\n\nNominated\n\n[43]\n\n\nBest Use of Music\n\nJim Williams\n\nNominated\n\nPossessor and its uncut version appeared on numerous critic's year-end lists including:\n\n1st \u2013 Jason Shawhan, Nashville Scene[44]\n3rd - Jim Ridley, Nashville Scene[45]\n4th - Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n, Vulture[46]\n5th - Elena Lazic, Sight and Sound[47]\n8th - Guy Lodge, Sight and Sound[47]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Possessor\".
