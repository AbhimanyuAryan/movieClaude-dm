The film stars Alexandra Daddario as an American English teacher in Tokyo, who loses herself to the city's nightlife and begins an affair with a member of the Yakuza gangs. It was released through video on demand on September 18, 2020, by Astrakan Film AB.[2]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMargaret is an American expatriate living in Tokyo. She works at a Japanese academy during the day teaching prospective flight attendants how to speak English. She spends her nights getting drunk with fellow expatriates Ines and Liam, and seeks out submissive sexual encounters with random men in the city's numerous love hotels. Her misadventures cause her to sometimes show up to work in a daze and disheveled, drawing the concern of her manager, Nakamura. However, Nakamura sees something of her younger self in Margaret and is sympathetic.\nOne day, Margaret crosses paths with a Yakuza enforcer named Kazu, and the two begin a relationship. Margaret is at first taken aback by Kazu's revelation that he is about to get married, but she continues with him after he admits that his marriage is more out of duty than love. Margaret confides to Kazu that she does not have a family: her father left when she was a child, her mother died from cancer, and she has a schizophrenic brother. She came to Japan to be alone.\nOn the day of graduation for Margaret's students at the flight academy, Kazu asks Margaret to spend the entire day with him in Kyoto. Initially reluctant to skip graduation, Margaret agrees when he says he will not get another day, and they take the train. He brings her to the Kiyomizu-dera temple and shows her the \"Buddha's womb\", a stone illuminated at the end of a pitch-black tunnel. Kazu explains the symbolism of being reborn by reaching the stone and says that he has brought Margaret there hoping to help her let go of her trauma; but Margaret seems unaffected. On the train ride back to Tokyo, Kazu leaves the train while Margaret is asleep, leaving her despondent and desperate to find him when she wakes up. When she returns to work the next day, she finds that she has been dismissed and replaced.\nMargaret spirals down further when Ines reveals to her that she is leaving Japan. Following numerous meaningless sexual encounters, Margaret spots Kazu with his family by chance one day and follows him into a love hotel. Kazu reprimands Margaret for following him, telling her nothing can happen between them. When Margaret insists that she loves him, they have sex one more time before he sends her away, leaving him saddened and conflicted. When Margaret returns to her apartment she finds an eviction notice. She desperately takes a job as a bar hostess for drunken businessmen, but finds herself unable to participate and leaves without getting paid.\nNow homeless and at rock bottom, Margaret is found on the street by Liam's girlfriend Louise, who reveals that Liam has been deported. After sharing a drink with Louise, Margaret gets drunk and begins wandering around Tokyo aimlessly at night until she notices of a strange man following her. She asks him to take her to a love hotel. She tells him that she likes to be submissive. On his orders she strips naked and lies down, the stranger then tying her hands and feet to the bed. When he suggests that he could kill her, she begs him to do it, but Kazu comes into the room to rescue her, having followed her. Grateful for being rescued, Margaret decides to start anew by leaving Tokyo. On the plane, Margaret notices Tamiko, one of her former students, as one of the flight attendants and they smile at each other while Tamiko demonstrates safety procedures before the plane takes off. Margaret calls Kazu to tell him she now understands the symbolism of the \"Buddha's womb\" and finally feels reborn, saying goodbye to him for good.\n\nCast[edit]\nAlexandra Daddario as Margaret\nTakehiro Hira as Kazu\nCarice van Houten as Ines\nAndrew Rothney as Liam\nMisuzu Kanno as Nakamura\nYasunari Takeshima as Used\nKate Easton as Louise\nHaruka Imo as Tamiko\nProduction[edit]\nIn December 2009, it was announced that Kate Bosworth would produce and star in Lost Girls and Love Hotels, based on the 2006 novel by Catherine Hanrahan. Jean-Marc Vallee was tapped to direct and Nadia Conners wrote the adapted screenplay.[3] However, the film never made it to production.\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Alexandra Daddario would star in a newly produced adaptation under the title I Am Not a Bird. The film later reverted to the original title. Hanrahan was hired to adapt her own novel and William Olsson was hired to direct.[4] The rest of the cast, including Carice van Houten and Takehiro Hira, was announced in November 2017.[5]\nPrincipal photography took place from October to December 2017 in Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan.[5][6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nOn July 8, 2020, it was announced that the film would be released on September 4, 2020, under Astrakan Releasing, the newly created distribution arm of Astrakan Films AB, the production company run by director William Olsson and producer Lauren Mann. The first trailer for the film was also released in conjunction with the announcement of the film's release date.[7] The official trailer was released on August 13, 2020, with a new release date set on September 18.[2] On October 5, 2020, the film was picked up for international rights in 2021 by Signature Entertainment.[8]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds approval rating of 50% based on reviews from 24 critics, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"While it's a well-acted and occasionally involving mood piece, Lost Girls & Love Hotels often dampens its erotic elements with listless ennui.\"[9] Metacritic reports a score of 57 out of 100 based on seven critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Lost Girls and Love Hotels (2020) \u2013 Financial Information\".
