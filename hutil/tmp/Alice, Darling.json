The film stars Anna Kendrick, Kaniehtiio Horn, Charlie Carrick, and Wunmi Mosaku.\nAlice, Darling had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2022, and was released in select cinemas on December 30, 2022, in Los Angeles at the AMC Sunset 5, before a wide release later in the United States on January 20, 2023, in AMC Theatres.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAlice is in a psychologically abusive relationship with her boyfriend, Simon. After taking a vacation with friends, she decides to reassess her relationship with Simon and attempts to break her codependency.\nSimon allows Alice out for a rare evening at a bar with her two best friends Tess and Sophie. The women notice that she is distracted and flinches at each ping from her phone, and throughout the evening she constantly touches her hair. It is implied that Alice met Simon in Tess' circle. However, despite Simon's connection to Tess, he seems to be removing her from her friends. Sophie proposes that they should celebrate Tess' birthday at her parents' house up north, which Alice readily agrees to. Rather than tell Simon the truth, she informs him it is a work trip to Minneapolis.\nOn the trip to the cottage, the trio makes a quick stop at a convenience store, where Alice spots a flyer for a missing girl, Andrea. The missing person case seems to consume Alice.\nThe three women spend time together at the cottage, the rural town and a lake near the cottage. Simon discovers where they are from reading Alice's emails and calls her, demanding she leave and return to him. Alice packs up but Tess hides her phone and wallet, while Sophie goes to the store as an excuse for Tess and Alice to spend time together. Tess tries to teach Alice to paddle board on the lake. She jokingly rocks the board thus Alice falls off and loses her earring, a gift from Simon. Alice in a panic dives down to find the earring. Unsuccessful, she returns to the shore where she suffers further panic attacks muttering the phrase that she \"can't do another thing wrong\". When pressed by Tess they have an argument and Alice confesses that she hid their vacation retreat from Simon. Tess questions Alice's well-being. Alice cancels her plan to leave and the next morning she joins the search party for Andrea. Somewhere near an abandoned cottage she finds lipstick and thinks it belongs to Andrea.\nBack in the cottage, the women repair their friendship and have a good time. Alice starts opening up to her friends, even at one point telling them that Simon never hurt her physically but eventually admitting Simon subjected her to emotional abuse. Alice stops responding to Simon's messages, leading him to show up unannounced with grocery bags in hand. That evening at a very tense dinner, Simon pulls out a newspaper showing the news that the body of the missing girl was found. Alice takes out the lipstick and says what she thinks about it. Simon condescendingly attempts to shut her down.\nThe next morning, Alice packs and leaves the cottage, surprising her friends. On the way to the main road, Simon stops his car at a junction allowing a long line of cyclists to pass. Sophie catches up with the car and breaks the back windshield using a maul. Alice gets out and locks eyes with Sophie, signalling to her friend that she does not want to go with Simon. Simon meanwhile demands for Alice to get back into the car, but she firmly declines. Tess steps in between Simon and Alice forcing Simon to give up. He walks back to the car and aggressively throws Alice's possessions out before driving away.\nThe film concludes with Alice riding the paddle board and taking a dive into the lake.\n\nCast[edit]\nAnna Kendrick as Alice\nKaniehtiio Horn as Tess\nCharlie Carrick as Simon\nWunmi Mosaku as Sophie\nMark Winnick as Marcus\nCarolyn Fe as Customer\nProduction[edit]\nIn July 2021, it was announced Anna Kendrick, Charlie Carrick, Wunmi Mosaku, and Kaniehtiio Horn would star in the film, with Mary Nighy directing from a screenplay by Alanna Francis, with Elevation Pictures set to distribute domestically in Canada and Lionsgate internationally.[3][4]\nPrincipal photography took place from June 21 to July 20, 2021, in Toronto.[5] The film doesn't hide the fact that the story is set in Toronto and surrounding areas, with location names and landmarks appearing clearly throughout the film.\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released in a limited capacity on December 30, 2022, in Los Angeles at the AMC Sunset 5, before having a wide release on January 20, 2023, in AMC Theatres.[6] It had its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2022.\nThe film was released for VOD on February 3, 2023.
