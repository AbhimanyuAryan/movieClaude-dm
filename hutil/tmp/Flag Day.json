        "In March 2012, Penn expressed interest in joining the cast of a Flim-Flam Man film adaptation directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.",
        "It was announced in March 2019 that a casting call for the film had been issued, with filming for the project due to commence in Winnipeg, Canada.",
        "Filming began in June with the cast including Penn and his children Dylan Penn and Hopper Penn. Josh Brolin, Miles Teller and Katheryn Winnick were also among the cast announced. In July 2019, James Russo was confirmed as part of the cast. On August 1, 2019, scenes were filmed at the Fort Garry campus of the University of Manitoba. Filming took place at Piedras Blancas in San Luis Obispo County, California.",
        "The film was produced by William Horberg, Jon Kilik and Fernando Sulichin.",
        "In an interview with Deadline Hollywood at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, Penn said that he initially thought that it would be something he might act in, but after trouble identifying the right director he took on the offer as it was a movie that he would have liked to see get made. It is the first film directed by Penn in which he also appears."

It was released on August 20, 2021. It was previously scheduled to be released on August 13, but moved back a week to avoid competing with another MGM film, Respect."

    "Reception": [
        "Flag Day was released in 24 theaters and made $40,750 in its opening weekend. According to Deadline Hollywood, the film was targeting an \"older, sophisticated demo.\" In its initial release, 56% of all audiences were over the age of 55, low numbers that were credited to the Delta variant. The film was screened in 50 theaters in its second weekend.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 86 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Flag Day benefits from powerful performances and a moving fact-based story, but it's largely lost in the movie's melodramatic din.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews."
