The film has received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nThis section needs expansion with: more details. You can help by adding to it.  (November 2020)\nThe daughter (Dylan Penn) of a con artist (Sean Penn) struggles to come to terms with her father's past, involving the fourth-largest seizure of counterfeit bills in U.S. history, nearly $20 million. \n\nCast[edit]\nDylan Penn as Jennifer Vogel\nJadyn Rylee as teenage Jennifer\nAddison Tymec as younger Jennifer\nSean Penn as John Vogel\nKatheryn Winnick as Patty Vogel\nJosh Brolin as Uncle Beck\nHopper Penn as Nick Vogel\nBeckam Crawford as Nick as a younger child\nRegina King[6] as U.S. Marshall Blake\nNorbert Leo Butz as Doc\nDale Dickey as Grandma Margaret\nEddie Marsan as Mr. Emmanuelle\nBailey Noble as Debbie\nProduction[edit]\nIn March 2012, Penn expressed interest in joining the cast of a Flim-Flam Man film adaptation[7] directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.[8][9]\nIt was announced in March 2019 that a casting call for the film had been issued, with filming for the project due to commence in Winnipeg, Canada.[10][11][12]\nFilming began in June with the cast including Penn and his children Dylan Penn and Hopper Penn.[13] Josh Brolin, Miles Teller and Katheryn Winnick were also among the cast announced.[14] In July 2019, James Russo was confirmed as part of the cast.[15] On August 1, 2019, scenes were filmed at the Fort Garry campus of the University of Manitoba.[16] Filming took place at Piedras Blancas in San Luis Obispo County, California.[17]\nThe film was produced by William Horberg, Jon Kilik and Fernando Sulichin.[18]\nIn an interview with Deadline Hollywood at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, Penn said that he initially thought that it would be something he might act in, but after trouble identifying the right director he took on the offer as it was a movie that he would have liked to see get made.[19] It is the first film directed by Penn in which he also appears.\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in July 2021. Prior to the festival, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, with plans to release it later that year through their joint venture, United Artists Releasing.[20] It was released on August 20, 2021.[21] It was previously scheduled to be released on August 13, but moved back a week to avoid competing with another MGM film, Respect.[22]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nThe soundtrack to Flag Day features original music by Eddie Vedder, Glen Hansard and Cat Power. The first single, \"My Father's Daughter\" marks the musical debut of Vedder's then-17-year-old daughter Olivia, who also sings lead on the song \"There's a Girl\".[23] The album with the thirteen-track soundtrack was released on August 20, 2021.[24]\n\nNo.TitleWriter(s)Producer(s)Length1.\"My Father's Daughter\" (Eddie Vedder, Glen Hansard and Olivia Vedder)Eddie VedderGlen HansardDavid Odlum2:502.\"Flag Day\" (Eddie Vedder and Glen Hansard)VedderHansardOdlum4:093.\"I Think of Angels\" (Cat Power)Kristj\u00e1n Kristj\u00e1nssonKK3:324.\"Tender Mercies\" (Eddie Vedder and Glen Hansard)VedderHansardOdlumAndrew Watt3:135.\"Rather Be Home\" (Eddie Vedder and Glen Hansard)VedderHansard\u00a03:256.\"I Am a Map\" (Cat Power)Chan MarshallCat Power2:017.\"As You Did Before\" (Glen Hansard)VedderHansard\u00a04:298.\"There's a Girl\" (Eddie Vedder, Glen Hansard and Olivia Vedder)VedderHansard\u00a03:339.\"I'll Be Waiting\" (Eddie Vedder and Glen Hansard)VedderHansardOdlum2:3510.\"I Will Follow\" (Cat Power)MarshallCat Power4:4811.\"Wave\" (Eddie Vedder and Glen Hansard)VedderHansardOdlum3:1912.\"Drive\" (Eddie Vedder)Michael StipeMike MillsPeter BuckBill Berry\u00a04:2413.\"Dream\" (Cat Power)MarshallCat Power5:22Total length:47:48\nControversy[edit]\nDuring promotion for the movie, at a time when thousands were dying monthly from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Penn stated he didn't want anyone who chose not to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to be allowed to see the movie in theaters, which upset the anti-vaxxer element.[25]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nFlag Day was released in 24 theaters and made $40,750 in its opening weekend. According to Deadline Hollywood, the film was targeting an \"older, sophisticated demo.\" In its initial release, 56% of all audiences were over the age of 55, low numbers that were credited to the Delta variant. The film was screened in 50 theaters in its second weekend.[26]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 86 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Flag Day benefits from powerful performances and a moving fact-based story, but it's largely lost in the movie's melodramatic din.\"[27] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[28]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Flag Day\".
