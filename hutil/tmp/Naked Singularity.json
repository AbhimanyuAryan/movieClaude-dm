        "In New York City, public defender Casi is 26 years old and has been out of law school for three years, but he is frustrated not only about his job but about the inability for many people to get the help they need. Craig visits the city impound lot and tells clerk Lea he wants to get a friend's car out, offering her a lot of money and flirting. Later, he is using the computer at her apartment. Several days later, Casi's friend Dane tells him Lea wants Casi to handle her case. Lea explains that she went to the Lincoln Navigator that Craig wanted and found the drugs he wanted. The car is scheduled to be auctioned in ten days. The police agree to let Lea help them. Lea tells Craig that for the risk she is taking, she deserves a million dollars. Later, Craig and a very large man kidnap Lea and take her to a building where she sees a body in a freezer.",
        "Casi gives bad advice to a defendant who escapes, and the strict Judge Cymberline threatens to end his career. Told he will get six month's suspension if he is lucky and disbarred if he is not, Casi starts talking with Dane about how they can benefit from the drugs in the SUV.",
        "During a power outage, Casi and Lea end up in bed at her apartment. When Casi leaves, he is confronted by Craig and his goon.",
        "On the day of the auction, Casi and Dane plot to get the SUV and the drugs, with Lea's help. Casi swaps the tracking device and Craig bids on the SUV, but a man with an accent wins the SUV. However, that man is pulled over by the police and the drugs are delivered to a building where men who appear to be Hasidic Jews are doing something illegal. Casi and Dane, dressed as Hasidic Jews, use tear gas to steal the money that was paid for the drugs. Casi and Dane rescue Lea from Craig.",
        "Casi, Lea and Dane each take a share of the money. Casi ends up back in front of Judge Cymbeline working for himself, representing a defendant who wants to sue the city."
