        "It was announced in February 2022 that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had landed the film, which Luca Guadagnino directed and Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist cast to star. Zendaya also served as a producer on the film. In a 2022 interview with Collider, Guadagnino cited Kuritzkes' screenplay, Amy Pascal, and Zendaya as inspirations for making the film.",
        "Principal photography began on May 3, 2022, in Boston, where a casting call took place for local residents to audition to play tennis players, general extras, and stand-ins. In preparation for her role, Zendaya spent three months training with pro-tennis player-turned-coach Brad Gilbert. Gilbert was also a consultant on the film. Filming occurred in and around the Back Bay and East Boston neighborhoods. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom served as cinematographer. Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Spanish luxury brand Loewe, served as costume designer. Filming wrapped on June 26, 2022.",
        "Guadagnino visited Zendaya on the set of Dune: Part Two in order to complete ADR for Challengers. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the film's score, having previously worked with Guadagnino on 2022's Bones and All. Post-production was completed by April 2023."

    "Release": [
        "Challengers premiered in Sydney, Australia on March 26, 2024 and is scheduled to be released in theaters and IMAX in the United States by Amazon MGM Studios on April 26, 2024, the same month as the centennial anniversary of the founding of MGM on April 17.",
        "The film was previously set to be released on September 15, 2023, and before that August 11, 2023. The film was also scheduled to have its world premiere as the opening film of the 80th Venice International Film Festival, but was delayed and pulled out from the festival by Amazon MGM Studios due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike at the time.",
        "Warner Bros. Pictures serves as the film's international distributor. Although the film was initially set for a direct-to streaming release on Amazon Prime Video in France instead of a theatrical release, the decision was reversed in January 2024, meaning the film would start streaming on the service 17 months after its initial theatrical release. While it was rumored the film would be released on April 24, 2024, two days before its release in the United States, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery denied this, stating the film had not been dated for a French theatrical release yet."
