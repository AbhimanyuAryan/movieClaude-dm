The film stars Zendaya, Josh O'Connor, and Mike Faist. Its plot follows a professional tennis champion who plots a comeback with the help of his wife, a famed tennis prodigy who retired after injuring her knee in a match. The final match pits him against another up-and-coming player, who also happens to be his wife's former lover.[2]\nAfter being delayed from its initial September 2023 release date and pulled out from its slot as the opening film of the 80th Venice International Film Festival due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, Challengers premiered in Sydney, Australia, on March 26, 2024, and is scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada by Amazon MGM Studios on April 26, 2024. The film received critical acclaim.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nTashi Duncan, a former tennis prodigy turned coach after a career-ending injury, is married to a champion on a losing streak. Her strategy for her husband's redemption takes a surprising turn when he must face off against his former best friend, who is also Tashi's former boyfriend.[2]\n\nCast[edit]\nZendaya as Tashi Duncan[3]\nJosh O'Connor as Patrick Zweig[3]\nMike Faist as Art Donaldson[3]\nJake Jensen[4]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIt was announced in February 2022 that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had landed the film, which Luca Guadagnino directed and Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist cast to star. Zendaya also served as a producer on the film.[5] In a 2022 interview with Collider, Guadagnino cited Kuritzkes' screenplay, Amy Pascal, and Zendaya as inspirations for making the film.[6]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on May 3, 2022, in Boston, where a casting call took place for local residents to audition to play tennis players, general extras, and stand-ins.[7] In preparation for her role, Zendaya spent three months training with pro-tennis player-turned-coach Brad Gilbert.[8] Gilbert was also a consultant on the film.[9] Filming occurred in and around the Back Bay and East Boston neighborhoods.[10] Sayombhu Mukdeeprom served as cinematographer.[11] Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Spanish luxury brand Loewe, served as costume designer.[12] Filming wrapped on June 26, 2022.[13]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nGuadagnino visited Zendaya on the set of Dune: Part Two in order to complete ADR for Challengers.[14] Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the film's score, having previously worked with Guadagnino on 2022's Bones and All.[15] Post-production was completed by April 2023.[16]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe film's original score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. A remixed version was released in collaboration with Boys Noize.[17]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nA trailer was released on June 20, 2023.[9] Zendaya revealed the film's poster on her Instagram at the new year 2024 along with its release date.[18] She jokingly called the film \"Codependency: The Movie\", while O'Connor compared it to the 2007 comedy Superbad.[19]\n\nRelease[edit]\nChallengers premiered in Sydney, Australia on March 26, 2024 and is scheduled to be released in theaters and IMAX in the United States and Canada by Amazon MGM Studios on April 26, 2024, the same month as the centennial anniversary of the founding of MGM on April 17.[20][21][22][23][24]\nThe film was previously set to be released on September 15, 2023,[25] and before that August 11, 2023.[26] The film was also scheduled to have its world premiere as the opening film of the 80th Venice International Film Festival,[27] but was delayed and pulled out from the festival by Amazon MGM Studios due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike at the time.[21]\nWarner Bros. Pictures serves as the film's international distributor.[28] Although the film was initially set for a direct-to streaming release on Amazon Prime Video in France instead of a theatrical release, the decision was reversed in January 2024, meaning the film would start streaming on the service 17 months after its initial theatrical release. While it was rumored the film would be released on April 24, 2024, two days before its release in the United States, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery denied this, stating the film had not been dated for a French theatrical release yet.[29][30]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 81 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With its trio of outstanding performers volleying their star power back and forth without ever dropping the ball, Challengers is a kinetic and sexy romp at court.\"[31] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[32]\nRobbie Collin of The Telegraph awarded the film five stars out of five, writing that the \"romantic thriller is the most purely pleasurable film of the year.\u201d[33]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Challengers (15)\".
