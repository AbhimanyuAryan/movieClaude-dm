It is Cram's feature directorial debut and Dobrev serves as an executive producer of the film.[1][2]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nWren Pepper is a thirtysomething party gal who works as a cashier at a stationery store. All of her friends since her teenage years are at different stages in their lives: Laurel is focused on competitive marathons and a new relationship, Cece is raising her young daughter, and Jill is busy with her new toddler and a bickering husband. Hoping to reunite the friend circle, Wren tells a white lie that she has cancer. The lie spirals out of control when her friends go above and beyond to support Wren, placing her in awkward situations where she\u2019s forced to lie to the public, her parents, and an actual cancer patient she befriends at a support group, named Leo.\n\nCast[edit]\nNina Dobrev as Wren Pepper[2]\nBrandon Mychal Smith as Leo\nSherry Cola as Laurel\nStephanie Koenig as Cece\nHayley Magnus as Jill\nRay McKinnon as Malcolm\nDan Bakkedahl as Fred Pepper\nWendi McLendon-Covey as Carol Pepper\nRandy Wayne as Derek\nProduction[edit]\nFilming occurred in Oklahoma.  In August 2019, it was announced that filming wrapped.[3]  The COVID-19 pandemic served as a factor as to why the film was in post-production for more than three years.[1] Patrick Stump serves as composer of the film, making it his first film score.[1]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released in theaters and on digital platforms in the United States on October 20, 2023.[4][5]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 38% of 13 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10.[6]\nCourtney Howard of Variety gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"On paper, it contains admirable notions about adult female friendships and the need to maintain that vital bond. In execution, however, those stirring sentiments are tested by taxing hijinks.\"[7]\nPete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood also gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"If you are going to do a so-called 'hilarious' comedy dealing with cancer you better know how to do it. Unfortunately, writer/director Jennifer Cram, for her first feature film in those jobs, does not knock it out of the park.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Wiseman, Andreas (May 5, 2023). \"Nina Dobrev Comedy 'Sick Girl' Heads To Cannes Market; First-Look Images Revealed\".
