All of her friends since her teenage years are at different stages in their lives: Laurel is focused on competitive marathons and a new relationship, Cece is raising her young daughter, and Jill is busy with her new toddler and a bickering husband. Hoping to reunite the friend circle, Wren tells a white lie that she has cancer. The lie spirals out of control when her friends go above and beyond to support Wren, placing her in awkward situations where she\u2019s forced to lie to the public, her parents, and an actual cancer patient she befriends at a support group, named Leo."

        "Courtney Howard of Variety gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"On paper, it contains admirable notions about adult female friendships and the need to maintain that vital bond. In execution, however, those stirring sentiments are tested by taxing hijinks.\"",
        "Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood also gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"If you are going to do a so-called 'hilarious' comedy dealing with cancer you better know how to do it. Unfortunately, writer/director Jennifer Cram, for her first feature film in those jobs, does not knock it out of the park.\""
