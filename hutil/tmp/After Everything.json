The direct sequel to After Ever Happy (2022) and the fifth installment the After film series, it stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin reprising their roles as Tessa Young and Hardin Scott, respectively.\nThe film was released in select theaters in the United States on September 13, 2023, by Voltage Pictures.\n\n\nPlot\nHardin is still pining for Tessa, a year after she broke up with him upon discovering his manuscript for 'After', their love story. His publisher Katherine urges him to produce a follow-up to the best-seller before year's end. \nForcing him to go clubbing with her and her friend, Hardin cannot enjoy himself as he has continual flashbacks of Tessa. Katherine and her friend get Hardin to take them to his place but he's not enjoying himself, drinking until he passes out.\nOver a lunch with his mother and birth father the next day, Hardin is reprimanded for drinking again, wallowing and not trying to move on. Explaining that Tessa was his whole reason for being and his muse, he has writer's block. Hardin's mum suggests he makes peace with the past, then mentions Natalie, from his youth is now living in Lisbon.\nHardin flies down to make amends with Natalie, going to the bridal shop where she works. She ushers him out, but meets with him later. Hardin has a flashback to when they'd met. To recover an expensive watch in a poker game, he accepted a bet to seduce her and record it.\nNatalie moved to Lisbon to escape the backlash from Hardin's friend making the video go viral. She's also lost her means to go to college, so decided to make a fresh start. After they've caught up, Natalie invites Hardin to meet her and her friends on the beach. There Sebastian, a guy wary of him, talks him into cliff diving.\nSailing the next day with Natalie, telling her about when Tessa broke up with him, Hardin is made to realise both situations were similar. Both had their private lives made public with no warning. Back on the beach, Sebastian and his friends beat Hardin up for making advances toward another one of his friends, who gets locked up in jail.\nHardin's birth father comes down and bails him out. He gives him a motivating pep talk, making him see that he can both hold a place in his heart for Tessa, but slowly work on moving forward. As Hardin is cleaning his space, he sees Landon's wedding invite, asking him to be his best man. He decides to stay a while longer, to try to write. \nNatalie comes by with a care package for Hardin, apologizing for Sebastian's behavior. She almost kisses him, but he reminds her he's still in love with Tessa. He thanks her for being able to forgive him. Hardin, feeling inspired, starts writing again. Finishing the manuscript entitled 'Before', he gives a copy to Natalie, asking for her OK before submitting as she's included in it. She's happy with it, Hardin surprises her with the coastal house of her dreams.\nBack in America, Nora is with Tessa, nervously hoping the ceremony proceeds without a hitch. As best man and  maid of honor, Hardin and Tessa walk down the aisle together, the first time they've seen each other in over two years. At the reception, he bribes his little half-brother to ask her to dance, so he can cut in. \nHardin's best man speech about missing half of his soul resonates with Tessa. He follows her out, they apologise to one another, then come together. Tessa calls them a mess, which he disagrees with. They decide they are inevitable. Hardin, in a moment of clarity, gets down on one knee and proposes. \nFlash forward, Hardin arrives home with his book 'Later' under his arm. He greets his little girl, then a visibly pregnant Tessa.\n\nCast\n\nHero Fiennes Tiffin as Hardin Scott\nJosephine Langford as Tessa Young\nLouise Lombard as Trish Daniels\nStephen Moyer as Christian Vance\nMimi Keene as Nathalie\nBenjamin Mascolo as Sebastian\nCora Kirk as Freya\nRosa Escoda as Kat\nJessica Webber as Maddy\nElla Martine as Naomi\nLaura Dutra as Paloma\nChance Perdomo as Landon\nKiana Madeira as Nora\nRob Estes as Ken Scott\nArielle Kebbel as Kimberly\nAya Ivanova as Emery\nCarter Jenkins as Robert\nAnton Kottas as Smith\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn August 2022, it was announced that a fifth film had been in development concurrently with After Ever Happy.
