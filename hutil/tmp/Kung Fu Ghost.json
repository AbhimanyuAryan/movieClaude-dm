        "Alan Ng at Film Threat scored it 6 out of 10 claiming \u201cdialogue is the film\u2019s greatest weakness.\u201d Jim Morazzini of Voices From The Balcony rated it 3 out of 5 and stated it should be of interest to a younger audience. That's My Entertainment praised the film, saying \"it knows exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be and leans into it.\" Space Jockey Reviews says it includes an homage to Ghost, claiming that it's a \"fun, ultimately uplifting movie.\" The Action Elite compared the film to older Jackie Chan movies and complimented the choreography. World Film Geek scored it a B+ claiming that the \"choreography is actually pretty decent for an American B movie.\" In a mixed review, Trina Boice says that that \"musical score is appropriately goofy\" but the \"dialogue is clunky and stiffly delivered.\""
