    "Plot": [
        "The film starts off in Rome, Italy 1516, where Leonardo da Vinci is using a 'telescope', made out of a mirror contraption, to examine the Moon's features in order to find if there was indeed life and seas on its surface. Leonardo is followed by members of the Papal Court into the room where Zoroastro reveals a human body for scientific probing, to search for the answer to life itself and the soul. The Pope is informed of this and orders Leonardo to cease further investigation into God's works.",
        "A soldier informs the Pope of the defeat of the army and their Milanese allies at Marignano and appoints Leonardo as a military engineer; however, his career is short-lived as he persuades the Pope to make peace with the French king, Francis I. Leonardo shows Francis his inventions and Francis decides to invite Leonardo to the royal court.",
        "Leonardo arrives in Amboise, and Francis orders Leonardo and his assistant, Cecco, to visit the under-construction castle in Remorantin, where he first meets Margeurite. Being away from the Pope, Leonardo continues his search for the soul and is confronted by Death. Leonardo explains his findings to Marguerite and she intends to help him in his research. Marguerite helps Leonardo build his 'Ideal City' instead of the castle which Francis had in mind.",
        "As Francis prepares for the festivities to which he has invited Emperor Charles V and King Henry VIII, Leonardo is forced to stop designing his Ideal City and works on inventions that Francis can show off to the other kings.",
        "Leonardo falls ill and is visited by the Papal Court, he decides to show them his research on the soul; however, Cecco disagrees with Leonardo's decision. As he is lying in bed he claims that he has discovered the \"Secret to Life itself\".",
        "As the concluding scenes of the film develop, Leonardo puts on a show on the Solar System and the understanding of what the Universe is. The lyrics of the last song before the credits, especially \"A Life well spent is long\", and that Leonardo flies into what appears to be the Milky Way may suggest his death, and the end of his story."
