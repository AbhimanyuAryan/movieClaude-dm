    "Plot": [
        "In Agua Dulce, California, the Haywood family trains and handles horses for film productions. One day at the Haywood ranch, small metallic objects violently fall from the sky. One of these objects, a nickel, strikes Otis Haywood Sr. in the eye and kills him.",
        "Six months later, his children, Otis Jr. and Emerald (\"OJ\" and \"Em,\" respectively), are fired from a set after their horse, Lucky, reacts violently to its own reflection in a chrome ball utilized for visual effects. To raise money, OJ has been selling some of the Haywood horses to Ricky \"Jupe\" Park, who operates a Western theme park called Jupiter's Claim. Jupe exploits his past traumatic experience as a child actor on the set of a family sitcom that featured a chimpanzee named Gordy. During filming of an episode, Gordy reacted violently to the sound of popping balloons and attacked most of his human co-stars, but ultimately left Jupe completely unharmed, before being fatally shot by police.",
        "One night, the Haywoods notice their electricity fluctuating and their horses violently reacting to an unknown presence. They discover an unidentified flying object (UFO) that has been taking their horses. The siblings decide to document and sell evidence of the UFO's existence, and recruit electronics store employee Angel Torres to set up surveillance cameras. The UFO arrives and abducts a horse that has broken out of the ranch stable, as well as a metal horse statue Em has stolen from Jupiter's Claim to act as a decoy.",
        "The next day, Em attempts to recruit famed cinematographer Antlers Holst to help them record the UFO. Holst declines, not wanting to encourage Em in what he sees as an endless pursuit of wealth and fame. Angel then arrives and reveals that a cloud in the valley never moves; OJ suspects this is the UFO's hiding place before theorizing, based on the UFO's flight patterns, that it is not a ship at all.",
        "Jupe introduces a live show in Jupiter's Claim, intending to use Lucky as bait to lure out the UFO. For months Jupe has been secretly offering the Haywoods' horses to the UFO to gain its trust and domesticate it before revealing it in the show. The UFO arrives earlier than expected and consumes Jupe and everyone in attendance, ultimately leaving only Lucky alive. OJ, attempting to retrieve Lucky, confirms his theory that the UFO is actually a territorial, predatory organism. After the creature showers the Haywood household with the detritus and regurgitated remains of the Jupiter\u2019s Claim crowd, OJ realizes that it only attacks those who look directly at it and devises a plan to record it. Em and Angel are hesitant until Em receives a call from Holst, who now agrees to help. OJ names the organism \"Jean Jacket\" after a horse that had been part of the Haywoods' stable in the past.",
        "To circumvent Jean Jacket's effect of shutting down all electrical equipment in its vicinity, Holst brings a hand-cranked IMAX film camera. The group sets up a field of battery-powered tube man props to track its location in the sky. However, a TMZ paparazzo trespasses onto the field and is thrown from his electric motorcycle when it shuts down near Jean Jacket, which promptly devours him. While capturing footage of Jean Jacket, Holst climbs a hill to sacrifice himself for a better view and is consumed along with his camera, forcing the remaining three to flee. Angel survives an attack from Jean Jacket by becoming entangled in a tarp and barbed wire, causing the creature to unfurl into a new, larger form resembling a jellyfish.",
        "OJ intentionally looks directly at Jean Jacket, drawing the monster's attention and allowing Em to use the motorcycle to rush to Jupiter's Claim. There, she untethers the park's large helium balloon mascot of Jupe, whose winking eye attracts Jean Jacket's attention. Jean Jacket attempts to feed on the balloon while Em uses an attraction's analog camera to photograph it; the balloon bursts inside Jean Jacket's body and destroys it. With the picture as proof of the creature's existence and reporters arriving nearby, Em sees an unharmed OJ and Lucky standing outside of Jupiter's Claim."

    "Production": [
        "On October 1, 2019, Universal Pictures announced a five-year exclusive production partnership with Peele's Monkeypaw Productions. Nope, then an untitled project, was announced on November 9, 2020, with Peele set to write, direct and produce. He said, \"I wrote it in a time when we were a little bit worried about the future of cinema. So the first thing I knew is I wanted to create a spectacle. I wanted to create something that the audience would have to come see.\" Speaking to GQ, Peele stated, \"So much of what this world was experiencing was this overload of spectacle, and kind of a low point of our addiction to spectacle.\" He added that he \"wrote [the film] trapped inside, and so I knew I wanted to make something that was about the sky. I knew the world would want to be outside and at the same time, I knew we had this newfound fear from this trauma, from this time of what it meant to go outside. Can we go outside? So I slipped some of that stuff in.\"",
        "Peele publicly cited King Kong and Jurassic Park, movies about humanity's addiction to spectacle, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Signs, and The Wizard of Oz as influences in his writing. He later identified the Angels of Neon Genesis Evangelion as the principal inspiration for the film's premise and monster in the film's production notes, impressed by the \"hyper minimalism\" and \"biomechanical design flair\" of Sahaquiel, the 10th Angel. He explained his decision to include a major focus on clouds in the film: \"The beauty of the sky is enthralling\u2014the first movies, in a way. Every now and then you'll see a cloud that sits alone and is too low, and it gives me this vertigo and this sense of Presence with a capital P. I can't describe it, but I knew if I could bottle that and put it into a horror movie, it might change the way people look at the sky.\"",
        "Peele originally wrote the character of Angel Torres as a \"happy-go-lucky\" geek-like character until Brandon Perea was cast as the character, who wanted to expand upon the character and portray him as more grounded.",
        "In February 2021, it was reported that Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya had joined the cast, while Jesse Plemons turned down a role in favor of starring in Killers of the Flower Moon. Peele wrote the script with Kaluuya in mind for the role of OJ Haywood. Kaluuya was paid $4 million for his involvement. In March, Steven Yeun was added to the cast.",
        "Principal photography took place from June 2021 to November 2021 in the Agua Dulce desert in northern Los Angeles County. The production received an estimated $8,364,000 worth of tax credits to shoot in the state of California. The film was shot on a budget of $68 million after tax incentives. It was the first to employ trainees (in this case, six) from Universal Filmed Entertainment Group's California Below-the-Line Traineeship for individuals seeking careers behind the camera. Nope was shot by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema using Kodak film, including 65mm film in IMAX, making it the first horror film in history to be shot in this format. Two cameras were used for the nighttime scenes\u2014one for infrared light with narrow bandwidth, and another that captured 70mm film. The overlaid images from these two were then added to the information captured from the film camera, creating the needed footage. On July 22, 2021, Peele revealed the film's title and shared its first promotional release poster, and further castings were confirmed. Peele chose Nope as the title because he wanted to acknowledge movie audiences and their expected reactions to the film. He said he had considered calling the film Little Green Men to reference a theme in the film of humanity's \"monetization of spectacle\". Filming also took place at the Burbank, California location of Fry's Electronics, which had closed along with all remaining Fry's locations several weeks before filming. The store was recreated in its operating state for filming. Fry's co-founder Randy Fry and his wife, reporter Vicki Liviakis, were present during filming at the Burbank store; they also had a cameo appearance at the Star Lasso Experience scene, which they filmed in two days.",
        "The 1972 Western film Buck and the Preacher, starring Sidney Poitier, is featured throughout the film; Peele said it was \"the first film that I know of that had Black cowboys represented in it. The myth that cowboys were just white guys running around, it's just not true, but we don't know that because of Hollywood and the romanticized view of a very brutalized era. The film, it shares a spirit.\" For her introductory scene, which also opens the film's first trailer, Palmer shot 14 takes of Emerald's monologue about her and OJ's family's history, which initially was not in the script prior to principal photography. Peele described each take as \"...very wildly different, uncuttably so. But just a tour de force, one of these things where you see somebody like, 'I'm going to make this choice this time and go for it.' There's improv in there.\"",
        "Caltech professor John O. Dabiri collaborated with Peele and his team on the design of the Jean Jacket monster's UFO form, and in particular its final true \"biblical angel\" form, which was inspired by those of Neon Genesis Evangelion and invertebrate aquatic locomotion among sea creatures such as jellyfish, octopuses and squid, to imagine a hypothetical undiscovered previously extinct sky predator, realistically imagining \"how could something like this hide in the clouds\", with its ability to \"generate electric field\" taken from electric eels and ghost knifefish, allowing for electric propulsion (\"Jean Jacket's fast flying without wings/sails\"). Guillaume Rocheron of Moving Picture Company (MPC) also worked with Dabiri and Peele on the visual effects shots featuring Jean Jacket, utilizing both CGI and practical effects, the latter particularly involving the use of a helicopter to swirl the dust and dirt on the ground the way the creature does when consuming its victims in the film. The film held its first test screenings just 12 weeks before its July 22 release, with the special effects still being worked on.",
        "The design for Jean Jacket's \"biblical\" form has also been compared to Orga, the \"final form\" of the Millennium alien species in the Godzilla 2000 movie, who are also living UFOs.",
        "Costume designer Alex Bovaird employed a \"method approach\" to create the characters' wardrobes, using 1990s sitcoms, indie rock bands, and the 1985 film The Goonies as inspiration. To match the film's Californian setting, Bovaird, Peele and their teams decided to create a contrast between \"super neon colors against the desert backdrop,\" and make the film's main characters \"look like action heroes, but cool ones.\" For OJ and Emerald's outfits, Bovaird went against the clich\u00e9s of how horse ranchers would dress and gave them casual clothes, an example being OJ's orange The Scorpion King crew hoodie, along with portraying Emerald as \"tomboy-like\" by having her wear clothing that she and OJ may have \"left at the ranch.\" Bovaird saw the character of Angel Torres as \"a bit of a cynical, angry guy\" and some sort of \"Latin-emo,\" but still \"perky\" due to his being a comic relief character, so he dressed him with a dark-colored palette that gets lighter as the film progresses, using band tees, cut-offs and Vans. Ricky \"Jupe\" Park's red cowboy suit that he wears in the Star Lasso Experience scene almost did not make the cut, for Bovaird was unsure if Peele wanted to go \"bold\". For the costume of Gordy, Bovaird and her team dressed human actor Terry Notary in a cardigan sweatshirt in the vein of the one Andy (Kerri Green) wore in The Goonies, with yellow and black stripes. Notary's actions were then transferred to the CGI chimpanzee created in post-production.",
        "Sound designer Johnnie Burn said in an interview with IndieWire, \"Jordan Peele is a director who really knows how to write for sound.\" He continued, \"The early conversations were along the lines of 'We want to be super realistic.'...And for that, we were kind of resisting the urge to hear anything from the monster too early on, because we wanted it to be credible that this was a predator\u2014and how could something so large be getting away with this if it was making a big noise? ... One of the main sounds we used was silence.\" Burn represented Jean Jacket's presence in the environment by stripping back layers, such as dialogue, wind, and the chirping of crickets. He additionally engineered wind soundscapes containing faint, obscured sounds, such as screams, to suggest Jean Jacket's movement through the air. The soundtrack was mixed in Dolby Atmos.",
        "The film's score was composed by Michael Abels, who had previously worked with Peele on Get Out (2017) and Us (2019). Abels described his score as having to meet the \"threat level\" described by Peele in the script and the ideas imposed by the film's quote \"What's a bad miracle?\" He added, \"The music needs to have both those senses together. Both a little bit of a sense of awe like we would have looking at the Grand Canyon, but then also the urge to run far away from the Grand Canyon because falling in would not be good. That's the dichotomy that's present in the film [...] you hear a sense of a little bit of awe and magic, and then there's sheer terror. But then there's also a sense of a real epic adventure towards the end and giant music that accompanies a giant, historic adventure.\" Working with the film's sound designer Johnnie Burn, Abels felt that the use of silence played an important role in scoring the film, saying, \"The tension between the negative space and the music is actually part of the music. Leaving room for the sound design, even when there's a cue playing, was an important part of the way I approached it. A lot of times in the scariest parts, especially in the earlier parts of this film, you're listening to what you hope you're not going to hear or what you thought you might have heard. The stillness allows you to freak out in that way.\"",
        "The soundtrack album was released by Back Lot Music on July 22, 2022, the same day as the film. The score album also features a screwed version of Corey Hart's \"Sunglasses at Night.\" Additionally, the film features the songs \"Walk On By\" by Dionne Warwick, \"Strange Animal\" by Lawrence Gowan, \"This Is the Lost Generation\" by the Lost Generation, and \"Exuma, the Obeah Man\" by Exuma."

    "Reception": [
        "Nope grossed $123.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $48 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $171.2 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, Nope was projected to gross around $50 million from 3,785 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $19.5 million on its opening day, including $6.4 million (down 14% from the $7.4 million earned by Peele's 2019 film Us) from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $44.4 million, topping the box office. It also posted the best opening weekend for an original film since Us. While the film came in on the low-end of projections, Deadline Hollywood still deemed it a success, noting its opening was higher than Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ($41 million), another R-rated original film released in July 2019, as well as its Friday-to-Saturday gross not steeply declining, indicating possible legs at the box office. Deadline also reported that despite failing to meet Universal's $50 million opening threshold for a longer 31-day theatrical window before going to premium video on demand, Universal would still honor the longer window for the film. The film dropped 58% in its sophomore weekend to $18.6 million, finishing second behind newcomer DC League of Super-Pets. It finished third and fifth the following two weekends, with $8.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. On August 9, 2022, during its third week, the film crossed the $100 million milestone in the United States and Canada, making it the first R-rated film to pass the milestone since Bad Boys for Life in January 2020. It also surpassed Universal's other horror film Halloween Kills ($92 million in the United States and Canada) to become the highest grossing R-rated film in the United States and Canada during the pandemic.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 455 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Admirable for its originality and ambition even when its reach exceeds its grasp, Nope adds Spielbergian spectacle to Jordan Peele's growing arsenal.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as Us, while PostTrak reported 79% of filmgoers gave it a positive score.",
        "A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film's \"impeccably managed suspense, sharp jokes and a beguiling, unnerving atmosphere of all-around weirdness\", and noted that, \"While this movie can fairly be described as Spielbergian, it turns on an emphatic and explicit debunking of Spielberg's most characteristic visual trope: the awe-struck upward gaze.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of four out of four stars, calling it \"an exhilarating piece of cinema filled with memorable characters\", and \"a classic example of a bold and original film that pays homage to a seemingly endless stream of great movies and yet is more than the sum of its parts.\" Odie Henderson, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, commending the film's sound mixing and calling it \"definitely Peele's creepiest movie,\" and writing that Peele himself \"remains a master of misdirection\".",
        "David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that \"Nope is tinged with the acidic satire that suffused [Peele's] previous two movies, as Peele examines why the easiest way to process horror these days is to turn it into breathtaking entertainment.\" Likewise, Michael Shindler of The American Spectator singled out Holst as a \"polite caricature\" of Werner Herzog, highlighting how the latter contrasts favorably with the film's heroes, and noted that Peele \"resists the temptation to warp the plot into a hackneyed morality play,\" instead playing \"the story straight\" in the vein of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers.",
        "Chris Evangelista of /Film wrote that \"Nope may not be Jordan Peele's best movie to date, but it is his most enjoyable. A true summer movie spectacle meant to be writ large across the screen, giving us thrills, chills, laughs, and that most precious of things: movie magic.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised the film, saying \"It doesn't hurt that Peele's latest boasts some of the most inspired [movie monster] design since H. R. Giger left his mark on the genre, or that Kaluuya's eyes remain some of Hollywood's most special effects, as Nope gets almost as much mileage from their weariness as Get Out squeezed from their clarity. It's through them that Nope searches for a new way of seeing, returns the Haywoods to their rightful place in film history, and creates the rare Hollywood spectacle that doesn't leave us looking for more.\" Screen Rant's Ben Kendrick called it \"a love letter to filmmaking\" and called Brandon Perea's portrayal of Angel Torres a \"stand-out\" among the supporting cast, while praising Kaluuya and Palmer's performances.",
        "Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair was mixed about the film, saying \"As Nope swerves and reels, it often seems distracted by itself, unable to hold its focus on any one thing long enough for deeper meaning, or feeling, to coalesce.\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote \"This ultimately feels like four very promising movies mashed together, with spectacular highlights bumping into each other in a way that's ultimately lacking, even as they all demonstrate the prowess and bravado of the filmmaker.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, writing, \"There is something clotted and heavy about this film, with sadly not enough of the humour for which Peele justly became celebrated in his double-act days with Keegan-Michael Key.\"",
        "In 2023, it ranked number 21 on IndieWire's list of films with \"The Best Cinematography of the 21st Century,\" noting that the visuals gave the film \"a unique sense of grandeur and mounting terror.\" The site also listed it at number 8 on its list of the \"62 Best Science Fiction Films of the 21st Century\" and number 4 on its list of the \"25 Scariest Alien Movies of All Time.\" Michael Abels' score also ranked number 2 on the site's list of the best film scores of 2022. Comic Book Resources ranked it at number 10 on its list of the \"10 Best Horror Movies of the 2020s (So Far),\" writing that \"There's no denying the genius-level storytelling that went into the making of Nope and its many layers that blend social satire with an overwhelming sense of dread and mystery. Nope is a mixture of the best parts of Alien and Jaws rolled into a movie that features one of the most unique creature features of the last twenty years. The fear of the unknown surrounding the creature and its unstoppable nature make for a wild ride in Nope that any horror fan will appreciate for its distinctive style.\" The site also called Jean Jacket one of the \"best movie monsters of the 21st century,\" noting the UFO creature's unpredictability and positively comparing it to the shark from Jaws. Far Out also listed the film as one of the \"10 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century,\" writing that it showcases Peele's \"unrestrained imagination in all the best ways\" and praised Jean Jacket's appearance as \"one of, if not the most, imaginative and singular alien creature designs in cinema history.\" MovieWeb ranked it as the \"Best Alien Invasion Movie of the 21st Century (So Far),\" writing that the \"Cinematography, sound design, and creature design are among the reasons that make this one of the best alien films in recent cinema.\" Marie Claire also included it on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time.\" On January 1, 2024, Rolling Stone ranked it at number 78 on its inaugural list of \"The 150 Best Sci-Fi Movies of All Time,\" writing \"Jordan Peele's third movie could be described as an alien invasion tale in the spirit of War of the Worlds. But that shorthand would miss wonderfully peculiar touches like a Black family that's wrangled horses for showbiz since the dawn of cinema or a Gold Rush-themed amusement park or sitcom cancelled after an on-set rampage by a chimpanzee. A flying saucer isn't secondary to all these elements, but Nope puts the threat of a UFO on the same uncanny footing as the Hollywood outsiders and misfits who have been summoned to combat it. For Peele to pack these ideas into a sci-fi summer blockbuster that still delivers is, frankly, a 21st century auteur flex.\""
