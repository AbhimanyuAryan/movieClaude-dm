The night of his arrival, he goes to a concert of Canadian Christian band, the Kry, where he meets the lead singer, Jean-Luc LaJoie, who becomes fast friends with Jeremy, who turns to him for musical advice.",
        "After the concert, Jeremy meets Melissa Henning, a fellow student at his school, and friend of Jean-Luc, who loves Melissa, but she does not feel the same. Jeremy and Melissa get to know each other, and quickly begin dating, causing a rift among the three. As a result, Melissa ends her relationship with Jeremy.",
        "Jeremy goes back to his family's home in Indiana for Christmas break. A few days after Christmas, he receives a phone call from Jean-Luc, saying that Melissa is sick, and asks Jeremy to come back to California.",
        "Upon his arrival, Jeremy visits Melissa in the hospital, who tells him that she has been diagnosed with Stage 3C ovarian cancer spread to her liver. She also tells Jeremy that she loves him. He says the same, proposes and Melissa accepts.",
        "During this time, Jeremy begins to make a name for himself as a Christian singer-songwriter. At one point, when Melissa is about to have an MRI. Melissa learns that the cancer has spread to her ovaries, so she needs a hysterectomy. She wakes up to Jeremy after the surgery was supposed to happen, who tells her the surgery was canceled as she is now cancer-free.",
        "Six months later, Jeremy and Melissa marry. Everything seems perfect until after their honeymoon, until she wakes up in pain. Jeremy takes her to the hospital, where they find out her cancer has returned, and that nothing more can be done for her.",
        "As Melissa grows weaker, Jeremy begins to question his faith in God. In the hospital, Jeremy sings a song he wrote (\"Walk by Faith\") during their honeymoon. Melissa passes shortly after.",
        "Jeremy becomes angry at God, and chooses to abandon his musical career, smashing his guitar until it breaks. Inside the guitar, Jeremy finds a note Melissa left for him to find after her death, telling him that suffering does not damage faith, but strengthens it. Her parting words encourage him to continue writing songs.",
        "Two years later, Jeremy performs a song he wrote after Melissa's death (\"I Still Believe\") about his suffering, but eventually restored faith. After the concert, he meets a woman named Adrienne, who tells Jeremy that she lost someone close to her, and she was angry at God, and his songs changed her life.",
        "Jeremy promises to share Melissa's story, believing that God will use it to change lives. The credits reveal that Jeremy and Adrienne got married in 2003, and have three children."

I believe that anyone, everyone can relate to this film because it's a story about love, loss, and hope.\" Apa later related that his role in I Still Believe is \"the coolest thing I've ever done\".",

Jeremy and Adrienne Camp and Jon Erwin spoke at Liberty University in early March prior to the film's release to promote I Still Believe.",
        "Due to movie theaters closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company announced on March 19 that the film would get an early digital Premium VOD release on March 27 in the United States and Canada, just two weeks after the film's theatrical debut and before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run. Lionsgate chairman Joe Drake said in a statement, \"With theaters closed nationwide due to these unprecedented events, we want to continue to make I Still Believe available to consumers... We're enormously proud of the movie that the Erwin Brothers created and are grateful to be able to share it with audiences for their home viewing pleasure.\" The Erwin brothers added, \"As filmmakers, we are heartbroken that we can't share I Still Believe on a big screen the way we intended. We make movies because we love movies and we stand firmly behind the nation's theater chains, from the largest circuits to the smallest mom and pop indies that have been so dramatically affected by these unprecedented closures. But the safety of guests comes first, and we're proud to have the opportunity to share online a movie whose inspiring message of love, hope and faith is perfect for these uncertain times.\""

    "Reception": [
        "I Still Believe grossed $10.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $16.4 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Hunt and Bloodshot, and was projected to gross $11\u201315\u00a0million from 3,250 theaters in its opening weekend. The film was number one at the box office on its first day at $4\u00a0million, including $780,000 from Wednesday IMAX screenings and Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to just $9.1\u00a0million, finishing third behind holdover Onward and Bloodshot. The weekend was also noteworthy for being the lowest combined grossing since October 1998, with all films totaling only $55.3\u00a0million, which was attributed to COVID-19 concerns.",
        "As the COVID-19 pandemic receded, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020.",
        "On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, I Still Believe holds an approval rating of 50% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"I Still Believe's palpable good intentions are offset by its predictable handling of a fact-based story that ends up preaching to the choir.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 4.5 out of 5 stars.",
        "In a favorable review, Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood said that \"I Still Believe doesn't rewrite any of the rules of this genre, but it does ask the right questions of faith in light of unimaginable tragedy without trying to sugarcoat them. For those who truly want to 'still believe', it should be enough. Fans of Apa also ought to be happy. Cynics should quarantine themselves from this; it's not for you.\" Megan Basham of World also wrote a positive review for the film, and, while criticizing it for its \"melodramatic raging\", similarly praised its depiction of faith amidst suffering, saying, \"[t]he Erwins are careful to show that God is faithful even when He says 'no.'\" Joe Leydon of Variety, in a positive review for the film, praised Apa's and Robertson's performances and commended the Erwin Brothers' direction, saying that in I Still Believe \"they amp the emotional power \u2013 subtly at first, then gradually more aggressively \u2013 with a 'Love Story'-style scenario that is all the more potent for being based on real-life events.\"",
        "Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commended the film for dealing with \"the difficulty of maintaining faith when tragedy strikes for no apparent reason\", although his review was ultimately negative, with him stating as a bottom line that \"[t]ears will be jerked, but you'll feel the machinations.\" Carla Meyer of The San Francisco Chronicle, while praising Robertson's acting and her chemistry with Apa, derided the film for the lack of \"any character development for Jeremy beyond caretaker and worried partner.\" Similarly, IndieWire writer David Ehrlich gave the film a \"C\u2212\", stating that \"[t]he power of the Camps' story is hard to deny, but it would almost be impossible to make it seem more hollow. Maybe if the Erwins depicted people with half the same detail with which they dote upon Jesus, I Still Believe wouldn't feel so insufferably forced to those of us who don't. Similarly, TheWrap contributor Carlos Aguilar, while praising Kristopher Kimlin's cinematography and the \"above-average production value\", called the film \"[s]accharine\" and \"[f]ormulaic to the core, from the protagonist's short-lived moment of doubt to the epiphany that sets him back on course.\""
