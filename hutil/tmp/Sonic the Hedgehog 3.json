        "In February 2022, Sega Sammy Group and Paramount Pictures had been in development of a third Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) film after Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022). The film was formally announced during ViacomCBS's investor event. Jeff Fowler returned as director, and Neal H. Moritz, Toby Ascher, Toru Nakahara, and Hitoshi Okuno returned as producers. In addition, a spin-off television series for Paramount+, Knuckles, was developed simultaneously with the film. The film will draw inspiration from the video games Sonic Adventure 2 (2001) and Shadow the Hedgehog (2005).",
        "On March 6, 2020, James Marsden confirmed that he had signed on for multiple sequels. In April 2022, Jim Carrey\u2013who portrays Dr. Robotnik in the films\u2013announced that he was considering retiring from acting. With his possible retirement, Moritz and Ascher confirmed that his role as Robotnik would not be recast in any sequels if he followed through with his retirement plans. However, they remained hopeful that they could develop scripts good enough for him to continue the role.",
