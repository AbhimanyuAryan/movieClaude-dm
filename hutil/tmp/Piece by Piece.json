        "In 2018, Variety reported that Illumination had plans to make a new animated film with the studio's frequent musical collaborator Pharrell Williams that would be \"made from scratch\". In January 2024, it was announced that Focus Features, Tremolo Productions, and I Am Other were developing an animated Lego style animated biographical film, about the life and career of Williams. Morgan Neville had been hired to direct, with Williams producing. Williams was not interested in making a \"traditional\" biopic, but rather convey the story in a more imaginative and \"genre-defining\" way, where audiences would \"immerse in a world where the possibilities are endless\". It was not specified if the film would be in the same computer animation style as The Lego Movie (2014) or if it would be stop motion. Williams posted the film's poster to his Instagram account as part of the announcement.",
        "Prior to the announcement, the film had been in development for about five years. Williams approached Neville with the idea for the film in early 2019, to which Neville agreed to help develop the project."
