It tells the story of the life of American musician Pharrell Williams in the style of Lego animation, making it the fifth theatrical Lego film and the first following the end of Warner Bros. Pictures' run of the film series, beginning Universal Pictures' run as holder of the Lego film rights. Williams also serves as a producer.\nPiece by Piece is scheduled to be released theatrically by Focus Features, with Universal Pictures serving as the international distributor on October 11, 2024.\n\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn 2018, Variety reported that Illumination had plans to make a new animated film with the studio's frequent musical collaborator Pharrell Williams that would be \"made from scratch\".[1] In January 2024, it was announced that Focus Features, Tremolo Productions, and I Am Other were developing an animated Lego style animated biographical film, about the life and career of Williams. Morgan Neville had been hired to direct, with Williams producing. Williams was not interested in making a \"traditional\" biopic, but rather convey the story in a more imaginative and \"genre-defining\" way, where audiences would \"immerse in a world where the possibilities are endless\".[2] It was not specified if the film would be in the same computer animation style as The Lego Movie (2014) or if it would be stop motion. Williams posted the film's poster to his Instagram account as part of the announcement.[3]\nPrior to the announcement, the film had been in development for about five years.[4] Williams approached Neville with the idea for the film in early 2019, to which Neville agreed to help develop the project.[5][6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nPiece by Piece is scheduled to be released in the United States by Focus Features on October 11, 2024.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Lang, Brent (November 6, 2018). \"Inside Illumination's Plans for Animated 'Super Mario Bros.'
