It tells the story of a Manhattan heiress (Michelle Pfeiffer) who moves to Paris with her son (Lucas Hedges) with the little money they have left.\nThe film had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 10, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on February 12, 2021. It received mixed reviews from critics, although Pfeiffer's performance was praised and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe bank seizes all the property of Manhattan heiress Frances Price several years after her husband's death. The close-to-penniless widow and her son, Malcolm, are left with few options. They sell everything in their house and relocate to a small apartment in Paris owned by Frances' friend, with the family cat, who happens to be Frances' reincarnated husband.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer as Frances Price\nLucas Hedges as Malcolm Price\nValerie Mahaffey as Mme.

The website's critics consensus reads: \"The smartly written French Exit offers proof that even the most caustic characters can be made entertaining \u2013 and even relatable \u2013 through a Michelle Pfeiffer performance.\"[17] According to Metacritic, which reports a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 critics, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".[18]\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B\u2212\" and wrote: \"Jacobs doesn't give us much else to hold on to. For all of its touching moments \u2013 and a series of closing grace notes that shimmer with a mystical flair missing from the rest of the film \u2013 this gossamer-thin adaptation is hampered by the same ambivalence that's haunted [Pfeiffer's character] Frances for so long.\"[19]\nPfeiffer received critical acclaim for her performance with many critics dubbing it Oscar-worthy and Variety's Pete Dubruge writing that she delivered a role \"for which she'll be remembered.\"[20][21][22][23][24]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nSatellite Awards\n\nFebruary 15, 2021\n\nBest Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n\nNominated\n\n[25]\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nFebruary 28, 2021\n\nBest Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nCanadian Screen Awards\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nBest Actress\n\nWon\n\n[27]\n\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards\n\nApril 22, 2021\n\nBest Supporting Female\n\nValerie Mahaffey\n\nNominated\n\n[28]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f \"French Exit (2021)\".
