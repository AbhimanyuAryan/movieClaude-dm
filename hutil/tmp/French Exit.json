The website's critics consensus reads: \"The smartly written French Exit offers proof that even the most caustic characters can be made entertaining \u2013 and even relatable \u2013 through a Michelle Pfeiffer performance.\" According to Metacritic, which reports a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 critics, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B\u2212\" and wrote: \"Jacobs doesn't give us much else to hold on to. For all of its touching moments \u2013 and a series of closing grace notes that shimmer with a mystical flair missing from the rest of the film \u2013 this gossamer-thin adaptation is hampered by the same ambivalence that's haunted [Pfeiffer's character] Frances for so long.\"",
        "Pfeiffer received critical acclaim for her performance with many critics dubbing it Oscar-worthy and Variety's Pete Dubruge writing that she delivered a role \"for which she'll be remembered.\""
