        "Director Nicholaus Goossen and comedienne Esther Povitsky have been friends for years, having worked together on many projects for Comedy Central, including her first comedy special Esther Povitsky: Hot For My Name. After working together for so long, they decided to develop a comedy vehicle for her to star in. The project first began in 2017, when it was originally conceived as a web series for the now-defunct ABC Digital. But when the site went out of business, they thought about continuing the show, but Povitsky's series Alone Together was picked up for a second season, so the two reworked the project into a feature film. The script was finished in 2020",
        "When describing the look of the movie, cinematographer Sherri Kauk described it as \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off with all the woke, millennial, modern twists.\" Filming took 19 days and was shot around the Los Angeles area."

Michael Cieply of Deadline gave the film a brief positive review, calling it a \"It\u2019s small, funny, and lands smack in the middle of a favorite genre: Off-center charmer turns world upside down. You know, Bringing Up Baby, What\u2019s Up, Doc?, Clueless, that sort of thing. Esther Povitsky is the charmer, Nick Goossen the director, and both of them wrote it.\""
