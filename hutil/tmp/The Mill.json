        "Joe, an employee of the Mallard Corporation, wakes up in a strange room with no recollection of his arrival. As he seeks help, he discovers he is not alone. The voice of another inmate explains some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the circumstances of the prisoners (\"employees\"). Any attempts to escape or ask for help during food deliveries result in further isolation. Joe's primary task is pushing a millstone. He faces the daily pressure of meeting the mill-pushing quota, and failure carries severe consequences.",
        "Over time, Joe's physical and mental strength are continuously tested. Despite exhaustion and distressing hallucinations, he remains determined to reunite with his pregnant wife, Kate. Joe confronts the malevolent AI orchestrating his ordeal, making a plea for freedom and reuniting with his wife. The AI, now threatened concedes to his request."

        "In February 2023, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film was \"recently-wrapped\" and was shot in New Jersey.",
        "O'Grady and Howery had previously worked together in the comedy film I Love My Dad (2022), in which the former produced and the latter played a supporting role.  In an interview with MovieWeb, O'Grady said that he wanted to collaborate with Howery again but in a drama film rather than a comedy.  Upon reading the screenplay of The Mill, O'Grady had Howery in mind as his first choice for the lead.  O'Grady said in an interview with Blavity that he \"read (the screenplay) in a night\", after producer Josh Feldman shared it with him.",
        "According to O'Grady, Howery chose not to know where the filming location was set and was literally blindfolded as he entered the set."

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 42% of 12 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10.",
        "Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave the film a score of two out of four. Tyler Nichols of JoBlo.com gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"Unless they're given a theatrical release, Hulu Horror films often miss the mark, so I went into this with very low expectations. Thankfully this provided a smart and poignant thriller that really takes aim at a lot of issues going on in society today\". Brandon Yu of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, writing, \"The film lacks any well-executed surprises to help it push past one-dimensional satire, and Howery is not strong enough of a dramatic actor to keep a single-setting, single-character film like this consistently engaging\"."
