    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 52 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"An impressive showcase for writer-director-star Leah McKendrick, Scrambled takes a humorous yet heartfelt approach to emotionally charged subject matter.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Samantha Bergeson writing for IndieWire gave the film a B+, saying: \"At times, Scrambled feels like a TV show, which isn't a bad thing at all. In fact, it's a compliment: the film has quick quips, good timing, and tight pacing mostly found in nowadays in episodic structures\". Nick Allen from RogerEbert.com wrote that even though he thought that some parts of the script was \"too forced with its emotions\" and its humor \"can be too broad\", he concluded that Scrambled \"proves to overall be a charismatic directorial debut from a promising writer/director/star\". He ended his review with, \"But Scrambled never loses sight of its sincerity, and McKendrick uses this space to lovingly illuminate, if not destigmatize a fertility option not given nearly as much visibility as other choices. She does so with a wealth of life wisdom and big laughs in the process\".",
        "Jessica Kiang of Variety wrote, \"Scrambled is a lot of fun when it's not trying to also deliver uplift, but it ultimately proves that white, middle-class American women in their 30s can can defeat any obstacle that stands between them and the unfettered life they want, except screenwriting convention\"."
