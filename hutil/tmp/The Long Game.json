It was theatrically released by Mucho Mas Media on April 12, 2024.[5][6]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of 119 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10.[7] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[8]\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film a positive review and wrote that it \"transcends its clich\u00e9s by being true to its characters and artistic in its approach.\"[9] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"Could have used more topspin, but a winning round nonetheless.\"[10] Therese Lacson of Collider graded the film a C and wrote, \"The Long Game isn't awful, it's perfectly serviceable as a sports flick about an inspiring all-American team, but that's all that it is: it's fine. There's little to write home about and it feels like a case of unfulfilled potential.\"[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Long Game \u2013 Financial Information\". The Numbers.
