Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it \"a solid, entertaining, insider's look at the life and times of a once-aspiring singer-dancer-actress from the Bronx who left home at 18 to pursue her dreams, got her first big break as a 'Fly Girl' on In Living Color, and for the last three decades has starred in some 40 major motion pictures and has sold more than 75 million records worldwide.\" Adam Green of The Detroit News called it \"an inspirational look at someone who has overcome the odds and continues to fight to be taken seriously and to have her voice be heard.\" Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and concluded that it \"is unlikely to majorly shift anyone's thoughts on Jennifer Lopez.\""
