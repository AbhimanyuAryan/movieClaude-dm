It is the sequel to Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) and the fifth film in the Ghostbusters franchise. The film stars Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Celeste O'Connor, and Logan Kim reprising their roles from Afterlife, alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton reprising their characters from the earlier films. Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, Emily Alyn Lind, and James Acaster also join the cast. Set three years after the events of Afterlife, the veteran Ghostbusters must join forces with their new recruits to save the world in New York City from a death-chilling god who seeks to build a spectral army.[9]\nFollowing the success of Afterlife, Sony Pictures announced the sequel in April 2022, with Reitman returning as director. Co-writer and executive producer Kenan later took over as director from Reitman that December, with the latter staying on as a co-writer and co-producer. That same month, Rudd, Coon, Grace, Wolfhard, O'Connor, Kim, Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton were all confirmed to reprise their roles. New cast members including Nanjiani, Oswalt, Lind, and Acaster were announced in March 2023, with principal photography commencing that month and wrapping in June. Dario Marianelli was hired to compose the film's score, replacing Afterlife composer Rob Simonsen. This is the first film in the Ghostbusters franchise to be released following the death of the franchise's co-creator and Jason Reitman's father Ivan Reitman, who posthumously receives credit as a producer alongside his son and Jason Blumenfeld. The film is dedicated to Reitman's memory and celebrates the 40th anniversary of the first film.[1]\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire had its world premiere at the AMC 13 Theater at Lincoln Square in New York City on March 14, 2024, and was released in the United States on March 22, by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed over $161 million worldwide, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThree years after the events in Summerville, Oklahoma,[b]  Callie Spengler, her boyfriend Gary Grooberson, her children Trevor and Phoebe, and close friends Lucky Domingo and Podcast, relocate to New York City to aid Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz in reestablishing the Ghostbusters. After capturing a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, the group face threats of closure by Walter Peck, a longtime opponent of the Ghostbusters,[c] who has since become the city's new mayor. To appease him, Callie benches Phoebe from further fieldwork until she is a legal adult. Upset at this, Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends the ghost of another chess prodigy named Melody, who died alongside her family in a stray fire.\nMeanwhile, Ray and Podcast begin collecting various cursed objects for examination and are visited by Nadeem Razmaadi. He sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings that was in his late grandmother's possession what Ray suspects is an apotropaic trap. A test of its PKE levels causes it to unleash a psionic pulse, which damages the ecto-containment unit \u00a0\u2013  dangerously near capacity \u00a0\u2013  at the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters. Winston later takes the orb for further examination at his privately owned paranormal research center run by his associate, Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device which is aimed at harnessing spiritual energy, Pinfield finds he cannot extract anything from the orb. To learn more, he joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals the orb was hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinetic powers but is oblivious about them. \nMeanwhile, Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a research librarian at the New York Public Library, for background on the orb. Wartzki reveals the orb was built by a quartet of sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a demonic god who sought to conquer the world with an army of ghosts, feeding on negative emotions[d] to lower temperatures to absolute zero. They learn Nadeem's grandmother was a descendant of the Firemasters, who prevented Garraka from escaping the orb accidentally in July 1904 in a mock ritual conducted by gentlemen's club members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. The orb's confinement by her was due to Garraka being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devilry horns as power source. \nWhen the trio attempt to stop a ghost from stealing an audio recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mom, Phoebe runs away from home, whereupon she takes Melody to Winston's research center and uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so that the pair can physically interact with each other. However, Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, offering to free him in exchange for passage to the afterlife. Forcing Phoebe to recite the ritual chant, Garraka escapes, locates his horns, and freezes the city. Realizing he seeks to free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons his grandmother's brass armor and attempts to master his powers.\nDespite their best efforts, Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Phoebe, seeking to fight back, reconfigures her proton pack with copper alloys available around the firehouse to strengthen it, whereupon Melody, betrayed by Garraka, makes amends by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka's. Ray finally entraps the god by utilizing the ruptured containment unit. Melody reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. The Ghostbusters, delighted with this, then begin a pursuit of the escaped ghosts across New York City.\n\nCast[edit]\nMain article: List of Ghostbusters characters\n\nPaul Rudd as Gary Grooberson\nCarrie Coon as Callie Spengler\nFinn Wolfhard as Trevor Spengler\nMckenna Grace as Phoebe Spengler\nKumail Nanjiani as Nadeem Razmaadi[10]\nPatton Oswalt as Dr. Hubert Wartzki[10]\nCeleste O'Connor as Lucky Domingo\nLogan Kim as Podcast[11]\nEmily Alyn Lind as Melody\nJames Acaster as Dr. Lars Pinfield[10]\nBill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman[12]\nDan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond \"Ray\" Stantz[13]\nErnie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore[14]\nAnnie Potts as Janine Melnitz[15]\nWilliam Atherton as Mayor Walter Peck[16]\nAdditionally, Kevin Mangold and Ian Whyte serve as the puppeteers for Slimer and Garraka, respectively, though the latters's voice performers were uncredited. Shelby Young and Ryan Bartley also appear uncredited as the voices of the Mini-Pufts, tiny versions and replicated forms of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, with Young returning from Afterlife.[17]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nFollowing the release of Ghostbusters: Afterlife in November 2021, Dan Aykroyd expressed interest in having the surviving cast of the original Ghostbusters team reprise their roles in up to three sequels.[18] In April 2022, it was announced that a sequel to Afterlife was in early development at Sony Pictures.[19][20]\nIn June 2022, the film was confirmed by director Jason Reitman under the working title Firehouse.[21] That same month it was announced that the sequel would take place in New York City.[22] On October 5, 2022, Mckenna Grace announced that she would reprise her role.[23] The following month, Ernie Hudson revealed he read a script for the film.[24]\nIn December 2022, it was announced that Gil Kenan would take over as director from Reitman, who still remains as a writer and producer. It was also announced that Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, and Carrie Coon would return.[25] In March 2023, it was announced that Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, James Acaster and Emily Alyn Lind had been cast in the film.[26] Lind's role was establishing during pre-production in secrecy. She met Reitman, Kenan, and casting director John Papsidera prior to filming, and was not aware she had the role shortly prior to filming.[27]\nAccording to Nanjiani, the filmmakers drew inspiration from the animated series The Real Ghostbusters (1986\u20131991), noting they \"wanted to make a long episode of the animated series\".[28]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on March 20, 2023, in London,[29] under the working title Firehouse, with Eric Steelberg serving as the cinematographer.[14][30] On April 25, 2023, Hudson indicated that Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Annie Potts would reprise their roles from previous Ghostbusters movies in the film;[31] Aykroyd confirmed he would return for the sequel in June 2023.[32]\nFilming was spotted in New York City where Casey Neistat was caught filming a stunt scene in a video posted on June 7, 2023, while documenting the effects of the 2023 Canadian wildfires in New York City.[33] Filming wrapped on June 23.[34]\n\nMusic[edit]\nOn January 18, 2024, Dario Marianelli was confirmed to compose the film's score, replacing Afterlife composer Rob Simonsen. This marked Marianelli's second collaboration with Gil Kenan after A Boy Called Christmas (2021). He recorded his score on the Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in the John Williams Music Building on the Sony Pictures Studios lot in Culver City.[35] Peter Bernstein returned as score consultant, after doing so for Afterlife.[36]\nOn March 7, 2024, Japanese girl group Atarashii Gakko! released a track called \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Summer\" as a collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan.[37] It samples Ray Parker Jr.'s song.\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire had its world premiere in New York City on March 14, 2024,[38] and was released by Sony Pictures Releasing on March 22, 2024.[2] It was previously scheduled to be released on December 20, 2023,[39][40][41] but was delayed to March 29, 2024, (taking over the original release date of Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse) in July 2023 another film made by Sony Pictures due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, before being moved up a week to March 22.[41][2]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nOn November 8, 2023, Sony released the first teaser trailer, which officially revealed the title as Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, as well as revealing the synopsis for the film.[42]\n\nHome media[edit]\nIn April 2021, Sony signed deals with Netflix and Disney for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the films' theatrical and home media windows. Netflix signed for exclusive \"pay 1 window\" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window and included Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and past Ghostbusters films. Disney signed for \"pay 2 window\" rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and/or Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.[43]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nAs of April\u00a019, 2024[update], Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has grossed $98.5\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $63.1\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $161.6\u00a0million.[8][7]\nIn the United States and Canada, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire was released alongside Immaculate and Late Night with the Devil, and was projected to gross $43\u201345 million from 4,345 theaters in its opening weekend.[6] The film made $16 million on its first day, including $4.7 million from Thursday night previews, slightly topping Afterlife's $4.5 million. It went on to debut to $45 million, landing between the opening weekends of Ghostbusters ($46 million in 2016) and Afterlife ($44 million in 2021), topping the box office, and pushing the Ghostbusters franchise past the $1 billion mark.[44] In its second weekend the film made $15.7 million (a drop of 65%), finishing second behind newcomer Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.[45]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 43% of 279 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire offers a certain amount of nostalgia-fueled fun for fans of the original, but a crowded cast and surprisingly serious tone prevent this sequel from truly sparking.\"[46] It is the lowest-rated installment in the franchise on the site.[47] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[48] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[44]\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film one star out of five, writing that \"There is a noxious undead pong emanating from this latest entry in the 1980s franchise, which is now being necromantically sustained through force of sheer commercial desperation, and nothing else.\"[49] Wendy Ide of The Observer awarded the movie two stars out of five, lamenting that the \"unoriginal\" film does not make the most of its young cast.[50] Jake Wilson of The Age gave it 2.5/5 stars, writing, \"Aykroyd and Grace are the soul of the thing, to whatever degree a soul exists. At this point, Aykroyd has shed any pretence of ironic distance, emerging as the mournful weirdo he surely always was.\"[51] CNN's Brian Lowry called it \"a very busy movie that lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor, while spending too much time on the wrong characters in a way that yields a rather lifeless, chilly affair.\"[52]\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that it \"carries the same endearingly goofy, science-nerd spirit of the first film and delivers a delightful balance of slimy ghost stuff, sharp one-liners, terrific VFX and a steady stream of callbacks to various characters, human and otherwise, from the 1984 movie.\"[53] Jake Coyle of the Associated Press gave it 2.5/4 stars, saying that it was \"A significant upgrade from Afterlife\" and \"a breezier, more serviceable sequel that has a modest charm as an '80-tinged family adventure.\"[54]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn February 2024, Gil Kenan revealed that ideas for multiple future films in the Ghostbusters franchise had been discussed.[55][56]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Although Reitman died in 2022, he received a posthumous producer credit on the film.[1][2]\n\n^ As depicted in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021)\n\n^ As first depicted in Ghostbusters (1984)\n\n^ As established in Ghostbusters II (1989) that powerful evil beings draw strength from them.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Bahr, Lindsey (February 13, 2022). \"Ivan Reitman, producer, 'Ghostbusters' director, dies at 75\".
