    "Plot": [
        "Three years after the events in Summerville, Oklahoma,  Callie Spengler, her boyfriend Gary Grooberson, her children Trevor and Phoebe, and close friends Lucky Domingo and Podcast, relocate to New York City to aid Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz in reestablishing the Ghostbusters. After capturing a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, the group face threats of closure by Walter Peck, a longtime opponent of the Ghostbusters, who has since become the city's new mayor. To appease him, Callie benches Phoebe from further fieldwork until she is a legal adult. Upset at this, Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends the ghost of another chess prodigy named Melody, who died alongside her family in a stray fire.",
        "Meanwhile, Ray and Podcast begin collecting various cursed objects for examination and are visited by Nadeem Razmaadi. He sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings that was in his late grandmother's possession what Ray suspects is an apotropaic trap. A test of its PKE levels causes it to unleash a psionic pulse, which damages the ecto-containment unit \u00a0\u2013  dangerously near capacity \u00a0\u2013  at the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters. Winston later takes the orb for further examination at his privately owned paranormal research center run by his associate, Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device which is aimed at harnessing spiritual energy, Pinfield finds he cannot extract anything from the orb. To learn more, he joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals the orb was hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinetic powers but is oblivious about them.",
        "Meanwhile, Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a research librarian at the New York Public Library, for background on the orb. Wartzki reveals the orb was built by a quartet of sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a demonic god who sought to conquer the world with an army of ghosts, feeding on negative emotions to lower temperatures to absolute zero. They learn Nadeem's grandmother was a descendant of the Firemasters, who prevented Garraka from escaping the orb accidentally in July 1904 in a mock ritual conducted by gentlemen's club members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. The orb's confinement by her was due to Garraka being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devilry horns as power source.",
        "When the trio attempt to stop a ghost from stealing an audio recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mom, Phoebe runs away from home, whereupon she takes Melody to Winston's research center and uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so that the pair can physically interact with each other. However, Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, offering to free him in exchange for passage to the afterlife. Forcing Phoebe to recite the ritual chant, Garraka escapes, locates his horns, and freezes the city. Realizing he seeks to free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons his grandmother's brass armor and attempts to master his powers.",
        "Despite their best efforts, Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Phoebe, seeking to fight back, reconfigures her proton pack with bronze to strengthen it, whereupon Melody, betrayed by Garraka, makes amends by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka's. Ray finally entraps the god by utilizing the ruptured containment unit. Melody reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. The Ghostbusters, delighted with this, then begin a pursuit of the escaped ghosts across New York City."

Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend the film.",
        "Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film one star out of five, writing that \"There is a noxious undead pong emanating from this latest entry in the 1980s franchise, which is now being necromantically sustained through force of sheer commercial desperation, and nothing else.\" Wendy Ide of The Observer awarded the movie two stars out of five, lamenting that the \"unoriginal\" film does not make the most of its young cast. Jake Wilson of The Age gave it 2.5/5 stars, writing, \"Aykroyd and Grace are the soul of the thing, to whatever degree a soul exists. At this point, Aykroyd has shed any pretence of ironic distance, emerging as the mournful weirdo he surely always was.\" CNN's Brian Lowry called it \"a very busy movie that lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor, while spending too much time on the wrong characters in a way that yields a rather lifeless, chilly affair.\"",
        "Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that it \"carries the same endearingly goofy, science-nerd spirit of the first film and delivers a delightful balance of slimy ghost stuff, sharp one-liners, terrific VFX and a steady stream of callbacks to various characters, human and otherwise, from the 1984 movie.\" Jake Coyle of the Associated Press gave it 2.5/4 stars, saying that it was \"A significant upgrade from Afterlife\" and \"a breezier, more serviceable sequel that has a modest charm as an '80-tinged family adventure.\""
