It is the third screen adaptation of the 1975 novel The Life Before Us by Romain Gary. It stars Sophia Loren, Ibrahima Gueye and Abril Zamora, and is set in Bari, Italy.\nThe film was preceded by Madame Rosa, a 1977 film based on the Gary novel, directed by Mosh\u00e9 Mizrahi and featuring Simone Signoret. Like the book, the first film version is set in Paris.[1]\nThe Life Ahead was given a limited release on November 6, 2020, followed by digital streaming on Netflix on November 13.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMadam Rosa is a former prostitute and Jewish Holocaust survivor who provides a home in her apartment for the children of other \"working women\" in the port city of Bari, Apulia, Italy. After Momo, a 12-year-old, orphaned, Senegalese immigrant, robs her, Dr. Coen, the boy's foster guardian, who also happens to be Rosa's doctor, brings her stolen items back and makes the boy apologize. Coen offers Rosa money to take in the boy and look after him for a couple of months, and she reluctantly agrees.\nMomo, who has been kicked out of school for stabbing a bully with a pencil, secretly sells drugs for a dealer in Bari, but Rosa also finds him work with Hamil, a kind Muslim shopkeeper. All of these adults try to guide the boy. Rosa's neighbor and friend Lola, a transgender prostitute, whose daughter Rosa looks after, helps Rosa as she begins to decline mentally. At times she is lucid while at others she is catatonic.\nRosa and Momo develop a deep bond, and after he becomes her only ward, he quits selling drugs. Although her health is declining, Rosa asks Momo to promise to keep her out of hospitals, of which she is terrified since being medically experimented as a child in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Momo agrees and promises, but Rosa is finally taken to the hospital after a particularly bad episode. Momo sneaks her out of the hospital at night and hides her in a basement storage room in her apartment building, where she feels safe. Momo stays there with Rosa, caring for her until she dies. Afterwards, Lola finally discovers their secret. The film ends with Rosa's funeral.\n\nCast[edit]\nSophia Loren as Madame Rosa\nIbrahim Gueye as Momo\nAbril Zamora as Lola\nRenato Carpentieri as Dr. Coen\nBabak Karimi as Hamil\nMassimiliano Rossi as drug dealer\nProduction[edit]\nIn July 2019, it was announced that Sophia Loren, Ibrahaim Gueye, Abril Zamora, Renato Carpentieri and Babak Karimi had joined the cast of the film, with Edoardo Ponti directing from a screenplay he wrote alongside Ugo Chiti, based upon the novel The Life Before Us by Romain Gary.[2]\nPrincipal photography began in July 2019 in Bari, Italy.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn February 2020, Netflix acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film.[4] It was released in a limited release on November 6, 2020, followed by digital streaming on Netflix on November 13, 2020.[5][6]\nAccording to Deadline, The Life Ahead became a streaming hit, peaking within Netflix's top ten in 37 countries.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nThe Life Ahead holds a 92% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 89 reviews, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A classic example of how a talented actor can elevate somewhat standard material, The Life Ahead proves Sophia Loren's star power remains absolutely undimmed.\"[8] On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 66 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[9]\nIn a three-starred review for The Observer, Mark Kermode said of Sophia Loren: \"The 86-year-old star\u2019s expressive performance as a former sex worker caring for an orphaned child is the main draw in this sometimes formulaic tale directed by her son.\"[10] P.J. Grisar of The Forward was critical in his review, calling the film \"treacly,\" \"derivative,\" and \"clich\u00e9d\" when compared with the 1977 film Madame Rosa, its \"nuanced and celebrated predecessor.\" He calls Loren's performance \"sturdy\" and Ponti\u2019s direction \"capable,\" but describes The Life Ahead as a \"wan exercise, free of humor or verve.\"[11]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nApril 25, 2021\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren & Laura Pausini)\n\nNominated\n\n[12]\n\n\nAARP Movies for Grownups Awards\n\nApril 25, 2021\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nSophia Loren\n\nWon\n\n[12]\n\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nNominated\n\n[12]\n\n\nBest Intergenerational Film\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nNominated\n\n[12]\n\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists Awards\n\nJanuary 4, 2021\n\nGrand Dame Award For Defying Ageism\n\nSophia Loren\n\nWon\n\n[12]\n\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\nOutstanding Foreign Film\n\nEdoardo Ponti\n\nNominated\n\n[13]\n\n\nCapri Hollywood International Film Festival\n\nJanuary 4, 2021\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nSophia Loren\n\nWon\n\n[14]\n\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nWon\n\n[14]\n\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nEdoardo Ponti\n\nWon\n\n[14]\n\n\nCritics' Choice Movie Awards\n\nMarch 07, 2021\n\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nNominated\n\n[15]\n\n\nBest Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nNominated\n\n[15]\n\n\nBest Young Performer\n\nIbrahima Gueye\n\nNominated\n\n[15]\n\n\nDavid di Donatello\n\nMay 11, 2021\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\nSophia Loren\n\nWon\n\n[16]\n\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nNominated\n\n[16]\n\n\nGeorgia Film Critics Association Awards\n\nMarch 11, 2021\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nNominated\n\n[17]\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nApril 8, 2021\n\nOutstanding Film \u2013 Limited Release\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nNominated\n\n[18]\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nFebruary 28, 2021\n\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nNominated\n\n[19]\n\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nWon\n\n[19]\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nBest Original Song in a Feature Film\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nWon\n\n[20]\n\n\nBest Music Supervision \u2013 Film\n\nBonnie Greenberg\n\nWon\n\n[21]\n\n\nHouston Film Critics Society Awards\n\nJanuary 18, 2021\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nNominated\n\n[22]\n\n\nMotion Picture Sound Editors Awards\n\nApril 16, 2021\n\nOutstanding Achievement in Sound Editing \u2013 Foreign Language Feature\n\nMaurizio Argentieri, Riccardo Righini and Mauro Eusepi\n\nNominated\n\n[23]\n\n\nNAACP Image Awards\n\nMarch 27, 2021\n\nOutstanding International Motion Picture\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nNominated\n\n[24]\n\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society Awards\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nBest International Film\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nWon\n\n[25]\n\n\nSatellite Awards\n\nFebruary 15, 2021\n\n\nBest Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama\n\nSophia Loren\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" (Diane Warren, Laura Pausini & Niccol\u00f2 Agliardi)\n\nWon\n\n[26]\n\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nEdoardo Ponti\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Zacharek, Stephanie (November 13, 2020). \"The Life Ahead Brings Sofia Loren Back to the Screen in a Tearjerker That Fully Earns Its Tears\".
