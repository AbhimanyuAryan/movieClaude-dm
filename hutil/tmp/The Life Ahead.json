        "Madam Rosa is a former prostitute and Jewish Holocaust survivor who provides a home in her apartment for the children of other \"working women\" in the port city of Bari, Apulia, Italy. After Momo, a 12-year-old, orphaned, Senegalese immigrant, robs her, Dr. Coen, the boy's foster guardian, who also happens to be Rosa's doctor, brings her stolen items back and makes the boy apologize. Coen offers Rosa money to take in the boy and look after him for a couple of months, and she reluctantly agrees.",
        "Momo, who has been kicked out of school for stabbing a bully with a pencil, secretly sells drugs for a dealer in Bari, but Rosa also finds him work with Hamil, a kind Muslim shopkeeper. All of these adults try to guide the boy. Rosa's neighbor and friend Lola, a transgender prostitute, whose daughter Rosa looks after, helps Rosa as she begins to decline mentally. At times she is lucid while at others she is catatonic.",
        "Rosa and Momo develop a deep bond, and after he becomes her only ward, he quits selling drugs. Although her health is declining, Rosa asks Momo to promise to keep her out of hospitals, of which she is terrified since being medically experimented as a child in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Momo agrees and promises, but Rosa is finally taken to the hospital after a particularly bad episode. Momo sneaks her out of the hospital at night and hides her in a basement storage room in her apartment building, where she feels safe. Momo stays there with Rosa, caring for her until she dies. Afterwards, Lola finally discovers their secret. The film ends with Rosa's funeral."

    "Reception": [
        "The Life Ahead holds a 92% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 89 reviews, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A classic example of how a talented actor can elevate somewhat standard material, The Life Ahead proves Sophia Loren's star power remains absolutely undimmed.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 66 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".",
        "In a three-starred review for The Observer, Mark Kermode said of Sophia Loren: \"The 86-year-old star\u2019s expressive performance as a former sex worker caring for an orphaned child is the main draw in this sometimes formulaic tale directed by her son.\" P.J. Grisar of The Forward was critical in his review, calling the film \"treacly,\" \"derivative,\" and \"clich\u00e9d\" when compared with the 1977 film Madame Rosa, its \"nuanced and celebrated predecessor.\" He calls Loren's performance \"sturdy\" and Ponti\u2019s direction \"capable,\" but describes The Life Ahead as a \"wan exercise, free of humor or verve.\""
