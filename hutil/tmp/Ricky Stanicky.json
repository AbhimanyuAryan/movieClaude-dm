    "Plot": [
        "Three childhood friends (Dean, Wes, and JT) prank one of their neighbors on Halloween Night by lighting a bag of dog feces on fire and leaving it on their doorstep. The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name \"Ricky Stanicky\" on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble.",
        "JT and his wife, Susan, are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin, have been setting it up. Dean gets a call from \"Ricky\" (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as \"Ricky\", and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what \"Ricky Stanicky\" has done.",
        "While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod, an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. JT's mother-in-law, Leona, does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. While Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky.",
        "At the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge as \"Ricky\", including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (Dean and JT's boss). When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. During the circumcision, the Rabbi has a reaction to the ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate.",
        "The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a  major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's \"Hero of the Week\" segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts.",
        "Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Rod begins to record Dean to ask for advice. In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life, while Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud.",
        "The next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's \"Hero of the Week\" segment. Erin meets with Dean, and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party.",
        "The \"Hero of the Week\" story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger.",
        "After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. Dean asks if she can forgive him. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps. At the party, Ricky tells the trio that Carly is now his fianc\u00e9e, and that they are all going to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend.",
        "During the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others cleaning, Carly donating her hair to children, Wes becoming a published author, JT brushing his teeth outside near his porta-potty while Susan and Whitaker watch, everyone posing at Dean and Erin's wedding, and a viral TikTok remix made with Summerhayes' comedic jerking motions at various conferences."
