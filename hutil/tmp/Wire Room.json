Robert Kojder, of Flickering Myth, gave the film a 1.5/5, saying \"Wire Room takes 95% of its running time to deliver a passable action sequence, using the term passable loosely\". Brian Orndorf, of Blu-ray.com, gave a negative review, writing \"another forgettable Emmett and Furla production determined to simply be product, not an exciting presentation of escapism with concentration on highly cinematic twists and turns.\" Mark Dujsik, of Mark Reviews Movies, gave the film a one out of four, saying \"our incompetent protagonist is in good company behind the camera, too.\" Brian Costello, of Common Sense Media, gave the film a 1/5 rating, writing: \"It's a little too easy to pick on this movie, and not really worth the time for anyone to bother watching it\"."
