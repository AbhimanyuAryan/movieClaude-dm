        "A year after forty-year-old Jenna Jones has been dumped by Brian, whose 10 year high-profile relationship defined her, her mother finally kicks her out. Moving back to NYC, she makes a career change into the world of beauty journalism.",
        "Jenna has to ask her frenemy Darcy for a job at Darzine, and is offered Creative Director on a three-month trial basis. That night she goes out with two close friends and randomly kisses a man 15 years younger than her. The next day at work, the hungover Jenna meets Eric, the same younger man. He is Darcy's son, the company's new videographer.",
        "Jenna and Eric will work together on content for the magazine's subscription relaunch. They agree to keep their hookup between them. On their first day on the rebranding mission, a visit to the reclusive Greta Blumen is an epic fail. They argue, and don't speak to each other all weekend.",
        "On Monday they call a truce, and Jenna invites Eric to bring a couple of friends to a dinner she and her friends are hosting so she can meet 50-year-old Jimmy. He is a perpetually single man, has a chip on his shoulder and antagonizes the much-younger Eric. Jenna and Eric spend some alone time together after the others leave.",
        "At work the next day, Jenna tells Eric their talk of the nostalgia for old films inspires her. She suggests they do a tribute to classic couture called Perfect Find. They get some designers to come aboard and offer some limited edition pieces, as well as some media influencers to help spread the word.",
        "Walking together on the Brooklyn Bridge with champagne to celebrate their campaign, no sooner than they say that they are going to cool it, they again end up at her place. Eric tells her about his dad Otis, who was killed when he was two. His dream project is to make a film about him. Jenna tells him about her and Brian, who met at college, were both overachievers and became a power couple.",
        "Brian is featured in Forbes, and in the article he clearly shows he misses Jenna. The NYT contacts Darcy to feature her as a media mogul for the Perfect Find. The subscriptions surpass 1 million, and when the Times article comes out, its focus is more on Jenna and Eric's work together.",
        "After Jenna shows she's jealous of Eric's ex Madison at a children' party, he leaves angry and ignores her calls and messages. Arriving home, Brian is waiting for her. He's grieving his mother's passing, so Jenna offers to drive him home, which Eric sees. Brian tries to get her to come in, but she declines.",
        "As Eric doesn't come in to work the next day and is 'editing at home', Jenna sneaks up to see him in Darcy's penthouse. They make up, then Darcy catches them post-coitus. Jenna gets fired and Eric doesn't defend them. He moves into his own apartment and works on his own film.",
        "After New Years, Jenna finally convinces Eric to meet with her in a cafe. She's teaching a fashion in film course at Columbia, he's making the film on Otis thanks to a grant. Jenna shows him her first sonogram, he is angry and leaves.",
        "A bit later, Darcy invites herself into Jenna's apartment and announces they are now family. Her own parents disowned her, so she alone raised Eric. He joins Jenna at her next obstetrician appointment and they later attend the next Darzine Gala together.",
