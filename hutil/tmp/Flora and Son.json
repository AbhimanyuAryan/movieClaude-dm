        "Principal photography took place on location in Dublin. Hewson and Gordon-Levitt were photographed with guitars while filming in Griffith Park in July 2022.",
        "Original songs for the film come from Carney and Gary Clark, with Clark also writing the score. Clark and Carney had previously collaborated on music for film, stage and television. Speaking at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, Gordon-Levitt was quoted as saying \"I finally got to play music in a movie! It's really true, I've always wanted to do it and I\u2019ve always been a musician at heart and love doing it. I\u2019ve learned to do many things for movies. I've learned to walk on a tightrope or play hockey or, certainly, lots of fighting and shooting and things like that. But this time I was practicing a skill that I've practiced most of my life, but having to do it at a bit more of a skill level than what I was used to.\" Hewson could play the guitar before they made the film and said all singing she does on screen is her and told The Hollywood Reporter although she had to overcome a \"massive, massive fear\" of singing in the film, she never turned to her father (musician Bono) for musical tips: \"I'd rather sing in front of the entire world.\""
