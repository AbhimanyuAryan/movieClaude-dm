It stars Adam DeVine, Nina Dobrev, Ellen Barkin, and Pierce Brosnan. The plot follows a bank manager on his wedding week whose bank is robbed by criminals that he very strongly suspects might be his future in-laws which gets proven right as he works with them when a crime boss that the criminals made enemies abducts his fianc\u00e9.[1]\nThe Out-Laws was released by Netflix on July 7, 2023.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOwen Browning, a young bank manager, and Parker McDermott, a yoga instructor, are about to get married. When Parker's estranged parents contact her to come to the wedding, Owen is excited that he will get to meet them, but she is concerned they can be overbearing.\nOwen calls Neil and Margie, his difficult parents, to relay the good news about Parker's parents attending the wedding. They show their ignorance of Parker's profession as a yoga instructor, believing it involves a stripper pole, and rather than being happy about the news, they criticize Parker's parents for being absent in her life.\nAt the bank, Owen has to free an employee locked in the vault as the result of a prank. In doing so, he shows and talks about how state-of-the-art their bank's security system is. They point out their rival bank's vault security is considered the best in the state. Owen also points out all vaults have an emergency escape latch.\nOut at dinner with his parents, they talk about the impending arrival of Parker's parents. Meanwhile, Owen talks with the storage space facility where they rent, as he's hoping to access photos of Parker for a wedding photo montage. His call inadvertently alerts Rehan, a crime boss, to their return.\nThe following night, Parker's parents scare Owen when they let themselves into the soon-to-be-married couple's home, while Parker is still out leading a yoga class. They insist Owen calls them Billy and Lilly. The next day, Owen takes a day off work to spend with the in-laws. They pick the agenda, so they go skydiving, get tattoos, and drink.\nWithin 12 hours, an infamous full-costumed pair of criminals called the \"Ghost Bandits\" hold up Owen's bank, with Owen, now hungover, in the building. Owen notices specific indicators such as the male's cologne, giving him flashbacks to the bar the night before. He also recalls security details he told Lilly, prompting him to believe that the robbers might be his future in-laws.\nFBI special agent Roger Oldham questions Owen as the bank manager, with Billy and Lilly behind him. Not able to say anything, Parker insists they leave once Owen breaks out in tears. Oldham has dedicated most of his career chasing the Ghost Bandits and he's convinced they are behind the robbery.\nTrying to enlist his parents' help in outing Billy and Lilly, Owen tells them his suspicions. They do ask direct and inappropriate questions at dinner, but Billy and Lilly expertly redirect the conversation. Parker later asks Owen why he is acting strangely, and while he tells her of his theory, she believes it is crazy.\nOwen follows his in-laws to Rehan's and hears Rehan threaten to kill Parker if they don't get her $5,000,000 more before the wedding. Oldham stops Owen on the highway, finds planted evidence in the trunk, and spills it on his in-laws. Oldham puts a wire on him, hoping to get Billy and Lilly to confess. Instead, Rehan shows up with her henchmen and takes Parker hostage as insurance. Disgusted, Owen joins forces with Billy and Lilly.\nThey first choose Victory Union Bank to rob, but after losing most of the cash they focus on the much bigger Atlas Reserve. Owen asks its manager, Phoebe, how he can better equip his bank, and she arrogantly shows him all of the safeguards. Just as the vault opens, Billy and Lilly create a diversion out front, while Owen locks himself in the vault and then uses the emergency escape latch to escape with the money.\nAt the ransom drop, Rehan is pleasantly surprised that Owen brought the money, but will kill them anyway. Owen miraculously guns them down as Billy and Lilly distract the cops, so Owen can sneak back into the vault with the money.\nFinally as Billy and Lilly turn themselves in, agent Oldham lets them go briefly to Owen and Parker's wedding reception.\nDuring the credits, Owen slips a paperclip into a piece of cake for Billy and Lilly to use to get free of their handcuffs.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAdam DeVine as Owen Browning, the manager of a bank\nPierce Brosnan as Billy McDermott, a member of the Ghost Bandits and Lilly's husband\nEllen Barkin as Lilly McDermott, a member of the Ghost Bandits and Billy's wife\nNina Dobrev as Parker McDermott, a yoga instructor who is Owen's fianc\u00e9 and the daughter of Billy and Lilly\nMichael Rooker as Roger Oldham, an FBI agent investigating the Ghost Bandits\nPoorna Jagannathan as Rehan Zakaryan, an Eastern European crime boss who the Ghost Bandits made enemies of\nRichard Kind as Neil Browning, the father of Owen\nJulie Hagerty as Margie Browning, the mother of Owen and wife of Neil\nBlake Anderson as RJ, the cousin of Owen\nLauren Lapkus as Phoebe King, the manager of Atlas Reserves\nLil Rel Howery as Tyree, a security guard at Owen's bank\nDean Winters as Vince Millen, the manager of Victory Union Bank\nLaci Mosley as Marisol\nDaniel Andrew Jablons as Gary\nSunny Sandler as Gracie\nPeggy Walton-Walker as Ruth, the grandmother of Owen\nMo Gallini as Boris\nJackie Sandler as Kay\nBetsy Sodaro as Ida, a chef\nProduction[edit]\nIn July 2021, Pierce Brosnan was cast in the film, alongside Adam Devine, for director Tyler Spindel.[2] In October 2021, Ellen Barkin, Nina Dobrev, Michael Rooker, Poorna Jagannathan, Julie Hagerty, Richard Kind, Lil Rel Howery, and Blake Anderson filled out the rest of the cast.[3] Principal photography took place in Atlanta, Georgia from October to December 2021.[4]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Out-Laws was released by Netflix on July 7, 2023.[5]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 21% of 73 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With a cast this talented, The Out-Laws can't help but provide some laughs -- but they're too few and far between to make up for the movie's derivative, sitcom-worthy setup.\"[6] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 36 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Lutz, John (October 29, 2021). \"'The Out-Laws': Nina Dobrev, Michael Rooker, and More Join the Netflix Action-Comedy\".
