        "A remake to Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead (1991) was announced in May 2020 to be in development by Treehouse Pictures. It was reported to be written by Chuck Hayward with Bille Woodruff attached to direct and was described as a \"present-day retelling centered on a black family\". In April 2022, Tyra Banks signed on to play Rose.",
        "In late February 2024, it was reported that the film was ultimately developed by BET+. Additionally, Wade Allain-Marcus replaced Woodruff as director. Banks was replaced by Nicole Richie to play Rose, reportedly due to a change in production schedule that did not align with Banks. She served as executive producer and creative advisor through her SMiZE Productions, where she consulted with the film's marketing strategy. June Squibb, Jermaine Fowler, Ms. Pat and Gus Kenworthy, Simone Joy Jones, Donielle Tremaine Hansley, Miles Fowler, Iantha Richardson, and Tyriq Withers round the main cast. Principal photography took place in Santa Clarita, California in June 2023."
