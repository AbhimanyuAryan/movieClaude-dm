It is intended to be the live-action styled photorealistic animated prequel to the similarly created 2019 remake of the original 1994 film The Lion King.[1] Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani reprise their character roles from the remake, and are joined by Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr., who voice their young versions of King Mufasa and Scar, respectively.\nDevelopment on a prequel to The Lion King was confirmed in September 2020, with Jenkins attached to direct and Nathanson finishing a draft of the script. Pierre and Harrison Jr. were announced as the voice cast in August 2021. The film was officially announced when its official title was revealed in September 2022 at the 2022 D23 Expo announcement. Production on the film slowed down in July 2023 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.\nMufasa: The Lion King is scheduled to be released in theaters on December 20, 2024,[2] by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nThe prequel about the rise of one of the greatest kings of the Pride Lands, goes back to the African savanna where Rafiki tells Kiara\u2014daughter of Simba and Nala\u2014the story of her grandfather while Timon and Pumbaa add color commentary.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nAaron Pierre as Mufasa\nKelvin Harrison Jr. as Scar\nSeth Rogen as Pumbaa\nBilly Eichner as Timon\nJohn Kani as Rafiki\nMufasa and Sarabi's granddaughter Kiara will appear in the film.[3]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn September 2020, it was announced that a follow-up film to the live-action-styled photorealistic CGI 2019 remake of The Lion King (1994) was in development, with Barry Jenkins attached to direct.[4] Reports indicated that the project would have a story centered on Mufasa during his formative years, with additional scenes focusing on the events after the first film; comparing the movie to a similar structure as The Godfather Part II (1974). The film will not be a remake of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), the direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film.[5] By this point, Jeff Nathanson, the previous installment's screenwriter, had completed a draft of the script.[6][7] The film was officially announced, with the title of Mufasa: The Lion King at the 2022 D23 Expo.[8]\nOn December 13, 2023, the Hollywood Handle reported that the film's plot would involve Rafiki telling the story of Mufasa to his granddaughter, Kiara, marking the character's first on-screen appearance in an animated feature film since The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.[3]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn August 2021, Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. were cast as the voices of young Mufasa and Scar, respectively.[9] By September 2022, it was revealed that Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani will reprise their roles as Pumbaa, Timon, and Rafiki, respectively.[10][11] During an interview with Fandango in April 2023 about his film Chevalier (2022), Harrison Jr. confirmed that the film will explore Scar's backstory, portraying him in a \"hilarious and very, very spicy\" way and expressing interest in how the young and sweet Scar's relationship with his brother Mufasa evolves throughout the film.[12]\n\nVisual effects[edit]\nIn September 2022, at D23, the first footage was played exclusively to attendees, thus revealing that production had been underway.[8][10][11] Moving Picture Company is returning to provide the visual effects.[13] In July 2023, production on the film slowed down due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[14]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn June 2022, Nicholas Britell was hired to serve as composer for the score on the film's soundtrack, after having previously collaborated with Jenkins on various projects.[15] In September 2022, it was announced that Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams would return for the film.[16]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nDuring the D23, an exclusive preview was shown to those who attended the D23 for the film, which revealed that Mufasa was an orphaned cub. The preview also revealed that Rafiki and Timon will tell stories about Mufasa's past and his way to becoming king.[17]\n\nRelease[edit]\nMufasa: The Lion King is scheduled to be released on December 20, 2024.[2] It was previously scheduled for release on July 5, 2024, but was delayed to its current date due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[10][11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Geisinger, Gabriella (September 30, 2020). \"The Lion King 2 has been confirmed \u2013 here's everything you need to know\".
