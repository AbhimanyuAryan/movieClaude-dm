Once he thought he spotted something otherworldly in the darkness of his studio, but he blamed it up to yesterdat's alcohol. The next day, while getting ready for sleep, Jack was amazed to see a mysterious figure outside his bedroom window. Jack and his wife Carol searched the street outside, but they found nothing. \nLater, while Jack was sleeping, the vile monster loomed over Jack again, and the very next day Jack's speech became not quite correct. As the film progresses, the being keeps on haunting Jack, destroying his physical and mental well-being. Jack suffers from new attacks, and he continues to blame the monster for his troubles. His wife and his best friend are wondering if he is going crazy, but the damage done to the Jack's body is quite real.\n\nCast[edit]\nJoey Collins as Jack[5][6]\nEna O'Rourke as Carol\nJesse Milliner as Billy\nMerryRose Howley as Suzy\nKelly Schwartz as Tricia\nReception[edit]\nMontiLee Stormer of Movie Reelist stated, \"There is a Monster is as simple a film as you can get. There is no flashy CGI and the effects are basic and practical. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, as it allows the story and characters to be the focus. The downside to is when folks are expecting a horror movie, there should be more than a few jump scares and shadowy figures in corners. The low-budget feel of There is a Monster didn\u2019t work against it, but you might want to dial down expectations.\"[7] Nathaniel Muir of AIPT Comics commented, \"Ultimately, There Is a Monster tries to do more than is necessary. A revelation at the end tries to make sense of everything, but it feels too contrived. As a whole, the movie is never actively bad, but it ends up taking itself too seriously. This makes sense considering its inspiration, but it also takes away from what is otherwise a run of the mill thriller.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"There Is a Monster (2024)\". FilmAffinity.
