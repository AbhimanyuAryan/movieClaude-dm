        "The Eras Tour began in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023, and is set to conclude in 2024. Each show spans three and a half hours, with a set list of 44 songs divided into 10 distinct acts that conceptually portray Swift's ten studio albums. The tour was a commercial success and received critical acclaim. It became a cultural and economic phenomenon, bolstered by globally unprecedented ticket demand and fan frenzy.",
        "In 2023, Swift commissioned a recording of the Eras Tour to be theatrically released as a feature film. Sam Wrench, who previously helmed Billie Eilish: Live at the O2 (2023) and Lizzo: Live in Concert (2022), was hired as director, and the film was recorded at the first three of six Los Angeles shows of the tour from August 3 to 5, 2023, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Swift's in-house production company, Taylor Swift Productions, produced the film independently in collaboration with Silent House Productions. Forgoing the involvement of major American film studios allowed Swift to reduce expenses; Puck estimated that the film cost $10\u201320\u00a0million. It was able to be produced, released, and promoted amidst the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike because it received special approval from SAG-AFTRA as a non-AMPTP production that met \"the same standards the unions are seeking in their negotiations with the studios\". SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated that Swift \"came to [them] and said she wanted to do this, but only if she could do it the right way under a union contract\". Swift announced the concert film on August 31 through her social media accounts and during an appearance on Good Morning America on ABC. Tickets went on sale the same day in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. On September 26, Swift announced that the film would be released globally.",
        "In the U.S., AMC Theatres served as both distributor and exhibitor of The Eras Tour, an unprecedented move in the American film industry, and screened it at least four times per day from Thursday through Sunday during each week of its run. Swift's parents negotiated the term sheet directly with Adam Aron, CEO of AMC. Ticket prices for standard screenings were preset at $19.89 for adults, a reference to Swift's re-recorded album 1989 (Taylor's Version), and $13.13 for children and seniors, a possible reference to Swift's lucky number, 13. The film was also made available on premium large formats such as IMAX and Dolby Cinema. Each initial ticket purchase included a free poster, while select locations advertised special-themed popcorn and drink containers. In anticipation of high demand following the 2022 Ticketmaster controversy, AMC upgraded its ticket sale systems to accommodate five times its original capacity and temporarily halted sales of most of its other films. Nevertheless, the mobile app crashed shortly after the sales began, and customers were placed in queues to access the website. Within hours of tickets going on sale, the film surpassed $10\u00a0million in pre-sales, which box-office analysts likened to the performance of a Marvel film. Global Internet searches for \"AMC\" spiked more than 100-fold, while AMC's stock experienced a brief 9.2\u00a0percent surge. Bloomberg News wrote that news of the film's high ticket sales \"boosted stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic\".",
        "AMC also served as distributor in other territories, distributing the film internationally and to unaffiliated theater chains for the first time in its history. Cinemark Theatres and other circuits were also granted distribution rights to the film. Chains that screened The Eras Tour include Regal, Cineplex, Cin\u00e9polis, Cinemex, and Odeon, in addition to AMC. Variance Films, via a sub-distribution deal, assisted AMC with U.S. bookings at non-AMC locations, and tickets were also available for purchase online via Fandango. The film was reported to screen in 4,000 theaters in North America, as well as more than 8,500 theaters worldwide.",
        "According to media outlets, the terms of its distribution and financing were dictated by Swift rather than AMC. Industry personnel considered the fixed pricing model and unacceptance of theater loyalty programs as highly unconventional and outside norms. No exhibitors or distributors except AMC were aware of the film's release plans until the morning of Swift's announcement; this frustrated executives, as distributors are expected to keep each other informed of their release schedules as a gesture of good faith. Business Insider stated that since the Paramount Consent Decrees \"were terminated in 2020\", the distribution agreement was legal. Puck journalist Matthew Belloni reported that \"disappointing\" talks with the major film studios had led Swift to instead negotiate a distribution deal directly with Aron. As part of the agreement, 43\u00a0percent of the box-office earnings will go to theaters, while Swift and AMC's distribution arm will split the remaining 57\u00a0percent. Additionally, theaters will retain all concession revenue and can screen the film for up to 26 weeks, although Swift has the option to send the film to streaming services after 13 weeks. The Hollywood Reporter wrote in late October 2023 that \"practically every major service\" was looking to secure subscription video on demand (SVOD) rights to The Eras Tour following its theatrical run.",
        "Trafalgar Releasing handled the film's global distribution and negotiated the release of the film in China, with Alibaba Pictures and Wanda Cinemas securing the deal. The film was later approved for release in China on December 31, 2023, which The Washington Post called a \"rarity\" due to the \"stringent vetting process for foreign films released in China\", which it attributed to Swift's status as the most popular foreign artist in the country with a dedicated fanbase and a favorable reception amongst Chinese media outlets."

    "Release": [
        "The Eras Tour had its world premiere on October 11, 2023, at The Grove at Farmers Market, an open-air mall complex in Los Angeles, California, with early preview showings on October 12. It received a worldwide theatrical release in more than 100 countries and territories on October 13, two weeks before the release of 1989 (Taylor's Version), while some countries and territories had a later premiere date of November 3, and in China on December 31, 2023. In the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Australia, the film was screened for four consecutive weekends beginning on October 13.",
        "Variety noted that the film's four-weekend theatrical run and wide North American releases were \"far from the kind of one- or two-night special engagement that music fans have become used to with filmed concert experiences\" in theaters. It also highlighted that limiting screenings to Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays would make the film feel like an event as audiences \"will be able to watch the concert extravaganza with a packed crowd and not in half-empty theaters during a Monday matinee\". Deadline Hollywood reported that as of October\u00a09, 2023, The Eras Tour had 65,000 showtimes on opening day across the U.S., totaling around 11.5\u00a0million seats. In China, the film opened across 15,000 screens.",
        "The Eras Tour's premiere at The Grove was attended by celebrities, journalists, Swift's family, her personnel, and over 2,200 invited Swifties. The mall and surrounding area of West Hollywood were closed for the premiere, with increased police presence. Swift delivered a welcome note in each of the mall's AMC theaters before the screening.",
        "On December 13, 2023, her 34th birthday, Swift released an extended version of the film in collaboration with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, featuring performances of \"Wildest Dreams\", \"The Archer\" and \"Long Live\". It was available to rent on video-on-demand services in select territories for a limited period.",
        "A longer, unabridged edit of the film, subtitled (Taylor's Version), was released to Disney+ on March 14, 2024. It includes performances of \"Cardigan\" and four surprise songs, namely \"I Can See You\", \"Maroon\", \"Death by a Thousand Cuts\", and \"You Are in Love\". Disney+ purchased the film's exclusive streaming rights for reportedly more than $75\u00a0million in a bidding war with Netflix and Universal, negotiated by Swift's brother Austin. To coincide with the launch of the film, the platform temporarily revamped its homepage and genre categories to titles inspired by Swift's eras. Variety reported the film garnered 4.6 million views in its first three days of availability, breaking the record for the most-viewed music film in the history of Disney+."

    "Reception": [
        "Upon release, The Eras Tour received acclaim from critics, and was recognized as \"the must-see movie of the season\", providing a compelling representation of the live performance on the screen. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 99% of 92 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour delivers exactly what it promises: A smoothly directed, impeccably performed documentary capturing the concert event of the year.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". It was the best reviewed musical movie of 2023, as per Rotten Tomatoes.",
        "Lina Das of The Daily Telegraph and Keiran Southern of The Sunday Times praised the film's energy and spectacle. Southern felt the film surpassed the live show in some aspects, with the camera work putting the audience \"onto the stage with Swift\". Kristen Lopez of TheWrap dubbed the film \"a bombastic celebration of joy and color\" and a \"spectacle of sound\", whereas Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com called it a \"technical spectacle\" and a \"dazzling achievement\". Reviews from Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, and Bilal Qureshi of NPR called the film an impressive and immersive work. New York's Craig Jenkins and Little White Lies' Lillian Crawford praised the cinematography for its portrayal of Swift's musicianship. Katie Campione of Deadline Hollywood emphasized the visuals, energy, and vibrance, while Tim Grierson of Screen International felt it was a both rousing and intimate view of Swift's musical dexterity. Peter Travers, writing for ABC News, said the film \"beautifully accentuates [Swift's] gifts for artistic reinvention.\"",
        "On the film's structure, Savannah Walsh of Vanity Fair highlighted that the film eschewed five songs and shortened the transitions between songs \"to shave the 3-hour-and-15-minute concert into a still-supersized 2 hours and 45 minutes.\" The Associated Press' Maria Sherman and The Guardian's Adriana Horton agreed that the film highlights the details potentially \"missed\" in a stadium; Sherman called it a near replica of the concert with limited edits and \"stage banter\", while Horton felt that the \"meticulous\" camerawork directed by Wrench aptly featured the dancers, backing vocalists, and band, who are often \"overshadowed\" by Swift during live shows. Cindy White of The A.V. Club liked how the concert is concise in the film to allow a seamless \"flow\" between songs and appreciated the \"expertly mixed\" sound\u2014the crowd noise diminished to focus on Swift's \"energetic\" vocals.",
        "Some critics faulted Wrench's camera direction. Wesley Morris of The New York Times called The Eras Tour a monumental and revelatory film; he praised Swift's \"arresting stature\" while criticizing Wrench for allowing shots \"all over the place\", but admitted accommodating the stage's scale and high-tech screen imaging into a cohesive film is an arduous task. Similarly, Time's Stephanie Zacharek disliked some of Wrench's \"reckless\" camerawork choices, but felt Swift's stage presence \"instantaneously airbrushes every questionable filmmaking decision into oblivion.\" Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune described Wrench as a director who typically employs conventional framing and editing approaches, but the film could have benefited from a more steady editing pace and reduced camera shifts to fan reactions. Mike Shutt from /Film thought that most of the film lacked meticulous shot compositions, and felt that Wrench relied on multi-camera footage and an expedited editing process. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said the film increased his understanding of Swift's artistry but felt that the short and monotonous camera shots made the watching experience \"wearying\".",
        "Conversely, Alejandra Martinez of The Austin Chronicle said the shots offer a \"great sense of scope\", capturing the show's scale and emotion while \"ramping up the excitement with every frame.\" Alonso Duralde called it a \"beautifully shot and edited\" film spotlighting Swift's showmanship. Melissa Ruggieri wrote in USA Today that the film \"offers a front-row seat to the grandeur\", complimenting the camerawork for capturing the tour's detailed production and Swift's charisma. In congruence, Uproxx's Philip Cosores and Variety's Chris Willman said the film prolifically emphasizes the performance and production details that \"get easily obscured by the overwhelming nature of live music\" from a concertgoer standpoint. NME's Kevin EG Perry described the film as \"three hours of slick, lovingly shot footage of a modern pop star operating at the very peak of her powers.\"",
        "Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\", while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 96% overall positive score, with 89% saying they would definitely recommend the film. Rolling Stone commented that cinemas were bracing for rowdy crowds after Swift encouraged her fans, the Swifties, to sing and dance at film screenings. The Wall Street Journal, CNBC and The Guardian reported that multiple cinemas were altering rules around audience behavior for The Eras Tour such as suspending evening age restrictions and allowing phone use, singing and dancing. Some theaters worked to recreate the tour's atmosphere by encouraging fans to dress up, offering friendship bracelet-making stations, and selling themed refreshments and merchandise. Audiences in some opening-day shows of the film were reported to have had highly enthusiastic and fanatic reactions.",
        "The Hollywood Reporter journalists reported dancing, singing and cheering audiences at the premiere, and that some screenings on the official release date \"felt more like a concert\" in terms of behavior while others \"were more muted\". The A.V. Club's Emma Keates felt it was jarring to attend a screening with no fan frenzy. Hornaday, who attended a screening where the audience was chanting, shouting and singing, opined \"one of the delights of The Eras Tour is that it makes moviegoing a contact, call-and-response sport, with audiences literally dancing in the aisles and waving at the screen as if their idol can see them.\" Insider's Eve Crosbie and NBC's Emilie Ikeda noted that videos of such audiences \"divided\" social media users who debated on audience etiquette; some felt it was a communal experience while some others felt it was excessive and disruptive.",
        "The film marked the first, official Swift-related activity in India, where the film was released on November 3, 2023, and was met with fan frenzy, \"delightful chaos\", \"loud cheers\", group singing and dancing. India Today reported that the theatre staff across India were unprepared for the energy and excitement of Indian Swifties. Local media drew comparisons with prominent Indian actors such as Salman Khan and Vijay, while internet users were critical of \"the love Indians were showering on an American pop star, saying they were obsessed with Western culture.\" Indian Swifties on social argued that \"if it was acceptable for fans to stand outside Shah Rukh Khan's house to watch him wave at them for a few minutes, they should not be criticised for enjoying the theatre experience they paid for.\" According to journalist Chingkheingambi Mayengbam, Swift and her concerts \"provide a space for celebration without conflict\u2014she's not fighting goons, revelling as the anti-hero, but fighting her own demons. Fans feel empowered without suppressing others, and her music serves as a medium for catharsis and emotional expression.\" In China, where the film was released on December 31, 2023, it was met with \"jubilation and frenzied planning\u2014as thousands of fans have mobilized across the country\", as per The Washington Post. The Chinese messaging platform WeChat reported an influx of groups in various cities dedicated to purchasing tickets before they sell out. In Beijing, people \"scoured Imax theaters to secure commemorative popcorn cups and drinkware printed with Swift's face\" ahead of the theatrical release."
