    "Plot": [
        "At a secluded winery in Sicily, Robert McCall kills a gangster, Lorenzo Vitale, and his henchmen to obtain a key to the winery's vault and recoup money stolen in a cyber-heist. While leaving the winery, Robert is shot in the back by Vitale's grandson. Robert attempts suicide due to his injury, but finds his gun out of bullets and then takes the ferry back to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, Robert pulls over and slips into unconsciousness from shock. He is found and rescued by Gio Bonucci, a local carabiniere.",
        "Gio brings Robert to a remote coastal Italian town called Altamonte where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio. As he recovers, Robert becomes acquainted with the locals and becomes fond of the town and its people. Robert makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins to tip her off about the winery's role in the illegal drug trade disguised as normal business transactions in Sicily. Collins and other CIA operatives arrive at the winery and find millions in cash along with bags of fenethylline tablets hidden in a storeroom, confirming Robert's suspicions.",
        "Meanwhile, members of the Camorra harass and kill villagers in an attempt to coerce them out of their housing and take over Altamonte for commercialization purposes. Robert overhears Marco Quaranta, a high-ranking Camorra member, pressuring local store owner Angelo for payments. To make an example of him, the Camorra firebombs Angelo's fish store as the entire town watches. Gio reviews video of the firebombing and calls the Italian central police for an inquiry. Along with his wife and daughter, Gio is attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations.",
        "Thereafter, Marco demands that Gio set up a boat for him. Overhearing the conversation, Robert asks Marco to move his operations to a different location. When Marco refuses, Robert kills him and his henchmen. The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Vincent, Marco's brother and head of the Camorra, and is ordered to find the person responsible for Marco's death. Vincent has Collins's car rigged with a bomb, but she survives after Robert warns her. Vincent threatens to shoot Gio in front of the entire town, only for Robert to reveal himself. The citizens begin to record Vincent and his henchmen on their camera phones, causing Vincent and his gang to retreat and return to his home; they then prepare to retaliate the following day.",
        "Later that night, Robert infiltrates Vincent's home, kills Vincent's bodyguards, and forces Vincent to take a lethal dose of his own drugs. Through Collins, Robert returns the money he had taken from the winery to an elderly couple's pension fund. Back in Langley, Virginia, Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. She receives a package containing a book of contacts and a note from Robert congratulating her and stating that her mother would be proud of her; thus, the note reveals Collins to be the daughter of Robert's late friend and colleague, Susan Plummer. With the Quaranta brothers dead, Robert celebrates with the locals after their football team's victory."

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 164 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Another entertaining outing from Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington, The Equalizer 3 mostly makes up for its formulaic story with generous helpings of cathartic action.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, same as the previous installment, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a\n90% overall positive score, with 72% saying they would definitely recommend the film.",
        "The Independent's Clarrise Loughrey gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \"At its best \u2013 and The Equalizer 3 is about as good as the first film \u2013 it neatly counterbalances Fuqua's baroque, blood-and-guts action with Washington's ability to command attention while sitting perfectly still.\" The Sunday Times's Tom Shone also gave it 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Whether enjoying a cappuccino, flirting with a waitress or snapping men's forearms, Washington makes it all seem like a movie star enjoying a midlife dolce vita moment.\" Kyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"For those who can tolerate extreme violence, The Equalizer 3 is diverting enough. If the script is so-so, the beautiful Italian locations, Mr. Washington's still-world-class charm and an eerie, frightening musical score by Marcelo Zarvos lift it.\"",
        "The film was nominated at the Saturn Award for Best Action or Adventure Film, while Fuqua  was nominated for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture and Washington for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture at the 55th NAACP Image Awards."
