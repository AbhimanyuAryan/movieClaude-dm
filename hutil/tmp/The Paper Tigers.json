        "The film was created due to director and producers' strong admiration of martial arts and old school, fun martial art films. The director Bao Tran began writing the film treatment for this concept in 2011. The inspiration for the movie came from his classmates and friendships when he studied martial arts.",
        "Tran had a male Asian-American main character in mind with a minority leading cast. The Paper Tigers team knew that it would be challenging to find studio support for the film as they wanted to cast people of color (POC) and diverse actors in the project as opposed to fall to the trend of whitewashing in film. When the film project was pitched to Hollywood producers, they were offered $4 million with a caveat that there would be no Asian lead character and suggested a white lead character to be played by Bruce Willis instead. They were also asked to write a role for Nicolas Cage. The team declined the offer and request. Tran mentioned that Hollywood usually sent their mid-level executives who were also POC to be the messengers of whitewashing.",
        "The team also had resistance from some other Asian Americans when seeking funding outside of major studios. Those who opposed wanted to advocate for different stories for Asian Americans instead of a martial arts film, which is often considered a stereotype. While Tran is aware of the history of Asian caricatures in the U.S., this story was based on his and the producers' personal experiences growing up as well as their love for martial arts. Tran emphasized having more representation and nuances, implying that there can be different perspectives of Asian-American storytelling. In addition, there can be developed Asian-American characters in a martial arts film, which is not typically seen in American media. He also mentioned that, \"at the end of the day, we wanted to tell a fun, entertaining story that depicted our experience honestly.\" Tran included both experiences in his director's statement as part of the movie's press kit, which can be found on the slider on Well Go USA's website.",
        "The team wanted to keep their vision without changing the cast or story. Tran said, \"It is important because I think it\u2019s ultimately being able to have your voice, and as a storyteller, be able to express your story and your history to the world.\" A short concept video was created and crowdfunded over $124,000 on Kickstarter in 2018. The concept video featured the teen versions of the main cast that would be later put into the film two years later. They were also able to draw interest from local investors, including a donor who studied under Bruce Lee, and were able to secure about $1 million for their shooting budget. This allowed the team more freedom in casting the main characters and other roles for their independent film.",
        "Filming took place in Seattle, Washington, which is a tribute to Bruce Lee's legacy and residency there. Many of the scenes were in Chinatown\u2013International District. Several local businesses were very supportive and that was a community endeavor. Tran said, \"Jade Garden provided the crew with food. The Dynasty Room let us shoot there, and the Nisei Vets Hall let us use their space.\" China Harbor's dining area was also featured in the movie. In addition, the City of Shoreline's film office provided locations for the crew to film like Richmond Beach and Fircrest Residential Habilitation Center.",
        "The director allowed actors to improvise in some of the scenes.",
        "The main cast Alain Uy, Ron Yuan and Mykel Shannon Jenkins became friends while filming. Ron Yuan had to gain 68 pounds (31\u00a0kg) for his role as Hing.",
        "On September 7, 2019, the crew planned to shoot the final fight on a rooftop at night, but a large thunderstorm delayed five hours of filming. About 2,200 lightning strikes were recorded that night, which averaged about eight strikes per second. They were able film the scene after the storm cleared, finishing their final day of shooting.",
        "It took about 34\u201335 days to shoot all footage."

This is one of the best films I have seen in years.\" Jessica Kiang of Variety stated in a review that \"Tran's irresistibly good-humored debut is a diverting blend of Hong Kong and Hollywood that delivers, on a slender, Kickstarter-enhanced budget, a rousing roundhouse hug to both traditions.\"",
