It is based on the true story of surrealist painter Salvador Dal\u00ed and his tempestuous marriage to muse and wife Gala during the 1970s. The film stars Ben Kingsley, Barbara Sukowa, Christopher Briney, Rupert Graves, Alexander Beyer, Andreja Peji\u0107, Suki Waterhouse, and Ezra Miller.\nDal\u00edland had its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 17, 2022 and was released in the United States on June 9, 2023 by Magnolia Pictures.\n\n\nSummary[edit]\nSet in the 1970s in New York and Spain, Dal\u00edland is told through the eyes of James (Briney), a young assistant at a New York gallery who's obliged to assist Salvador Dal\u00ed (Kingsley) for a gallery show and ends up immersed into the unconventional world of Dal\u00ed's bohemian lifestyle and his strange marriage to his wife Gala (Sukowa). After the exhibition, and with signs of increasing strain on the bond between Gala and Salvador, James follows the Dal\u00eds to Spain, where the painter later dies.[2]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBen Kingsley as Salvador Dal\u00ed\nEzra Miller as Young Dal\u00ed\nBarbara Sukowa as Gala\nAvital Lvova as Young Gala\nChristopher Briney as James Linton\nRupert Graves as Captain Moore\nAlexander Beyer as Christoffe\nAndreja Peji\u0107 as Amanda Lear\nSuki Waterhouse as Ginesta/Lucy\nMark McKenna as Alice Cooper\nZachary Nachbar-Seckel as Jeff Fenholt\nJoella Hinson-King as Donyale Luna\nPaul Hilton as Milan Art Dealer\nIrina Leoncio as Nurse\nAlberto Maneiro as Functionary\nMatthew James Ovens as Renaldo\nMerce Ribot as Rosa\nJack Shalloo as Desmond Carter\nGavin Spokes as Gilbert Hamond\nProduction[edit]\nIn May 2018, Ben Kingsley, Lesley Manville, Tim Roth, Frank Dillane and Ezra Miller joined the cast of the film, with Mary Harron directing from a screenplay by herself and John C. Walsh.[3][4] Miller was initially cast as James by Harron, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, leading Harron to cast newcomer Christopher Briney. Miller was instead offered the role of a young Salvador Dal\u00ed (who's played by Ben Kingsley for most of the film in his later years), appearing only sparingly in some flashback sequences.[5] In May 2021, Barbara Sukowa, Alexander Beyer, Avital Lvova, Christopher Briney, and Rupert Graves were added, while Andreja Peji\u0107, Suki Waterhouse and Mark McKenna had replaced Manville, Roth and Dillane, and principal photography has been concluded.[6]\nThe movie was largely filmed in Liverpool which was used to double New York City.[7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nDal\u00edland had its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 17, 2022.[8] In November 2022, Magnolia Pictures acquired distribution rights to the film.[9] It received a theatrical and on-demand release on June 9, 2023.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of 64 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Ben Kingsley adds some rich color to Dal\u00edland's palette, but given the dynamic subject matter, this is a frustratingly bland biopic portrait.\"[11] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Dal\u00edland (2023)\".
