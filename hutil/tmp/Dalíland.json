        "In May 2018, Ben Kingsley, Lesley Manville, Tim Roth, Frank Dillane and Ezra Miller joined the cast of the film, with Mary Harron directing from a screenplay by herself and John C. Walsh. Miller was initially cast as James by Harron, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, leading Harron to cast newcomer Christopher Briney. Miller was instead offered the role of a young Salvador Dal\u00ed (who's played by Ben Kingsley for most of the film in his later years), appearing only sparingly in some flashback sequences. In May 2021, Barbara Sukowa, Alexander Beyer, Avital Lvova, Christopher Briney, and Rupert Graves were added, while Andreja Peji\u0107, Suki Waterhouse and Mark McKenna had replaced Manville, Roth and Dillane, and principal photography has been concluded.",
        "The movie was largely filmed in Liverpool which was used to double New York City."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of 64 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Ben Kingsley adds some rich color to Dal\u00edland's palette, but given the dynamic subject matter, this is a frustratingly bland biopic portrait.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews."
