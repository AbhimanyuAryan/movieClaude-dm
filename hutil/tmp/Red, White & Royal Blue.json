        "Alex Claremont-Diaz, the first son of the United States, attends the wedding of Prince Phillip, Duke of Cambridge. Alex has a long-standing feud with Prince Henry, Prince Phillip's younger brother. During the reception, Alex and Henry get into an argument that results in the wedding cake falling on top of them.",
        "To mitigate the fallout and help his mother's re-election campaign, Alex and Henry are forced into a series of interviews and appearances, where they pose as friends. Alex later admits to Henry that he began to resent him after Henry rebuffed him at Alex's first appearance as a public figure. Henry apologizes, explaining he had just lost his father and was forced to go to events, and the two make amends, later beginning to text and become friends.",
        "Invited to Alex's annual New Year's party, Henry leaves abruptly after seeing Alex kiss several girls at midnight. Alex follows him outdoors to the White House grounds. Henry kisses Alex, but fails to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him over the following weeks. After confiding in Nora, his best friend and the Vice President's granddaughter, Alex realizes that he is attracted to Henry.",
        "Weeks later, Alex reunites with Henry and the pair become lovers, although they keep their involvement secret from everyone except close family and friends, and their Secret Service and MI5 bodyguards.",
        "When Alex comes up with a plan for his mother to win Texas in the upcoming election, he travels there to lead the campaign. When he goes to Brooklyn to speak at the Democratic National Convention, Henry unexpectedly visits him. Alex later comes out to his mother, who is supportive, but advises him to think about his relationship carefully.",
        "Alex invites Henry to his family's vacation home near Austin, Texas, and Alex begins to tell Henry that he is in love with him, but Henry, fearing that he cannot sustain a love-relationship \u2013 since the British royal family will not accept it \u2013 preemptively leaves the conversation and flees to England. He refuses to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him. Alex visits Henry in London unexpectedly and demands an explanation for his behavior. Henry admits that he loves Alex too, but explains that his royal position makes it impossible. Alex convinces Henry that their relationship is worth fighting for, and the two reconcile.",
        "Shortly after Alex returns to the U.S., Alex and Henry's personal e\u2011mails to each other are hacked and posted online, and are being widely reported in the press. Both the White House and the Palace cut off all Henry's and Alex's means of contact. Zahra, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, gets in touch with Shaan, Henry's equerry, and Alex and Henry are finally able to talk. Alex immediately flies to London to reunite with Henry. King James III summons them to a meeting and tells them that they cannot be together since their relationship is incompatible with royal tradition. However, Henry's supportive sister Beatrice notices a crowd gathered in front of Buckingham Palace in support of them, and news reports of similar crowds all over the U.K. Alex and Henry step outside together onto the balcony and openly greet the public as a couple.",
        "On election night, Henry returns to the United States to be with Alex, whose plan to win Texas for his mother ultimately results in her re-election. Alex and Henry later visit Alex's childhood home in Austin to personally celebrate."

        "Red, White & Royal Blue had its world premiere at the BFI IMAX in London on July 22, 2023, although its actors were absent due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Matthew L\u00f3pez was the only member of the production present but did not walk the red carpet, or give interviews as he was also on strike as a member of the Writers Guild of America.",
        "The film was released on Amazon Prime Video on August 11, 2023. For the first three weeks after its release, it was the top watched film worldwide on the platform and provoked what Prime Video described as \"a huge surge\" of new subscribers."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 116 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Amusing and endearing, Red, White & Royal Blue is a cheerfully formulaic rom-com that embraces inclusion without falling back on stereotypes.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "CNN Entertainment's Brian Lowry stated that the film \"is at its core a fairy-tale romance \u2013 only where the challenge isn't the customary wicked stepmother or malevolent witch, but rather what happens when true love finds two princes, not one.\" Amy Nicholson of The New York Times wrote: \"It sounds like fan fiction and looks like it, too, particularly when Galitzine dips his chin bashfully \u2013 a tic that Princess Diana passed on to her boys. Yet, as in any screwball romance worth its trans-Atlantic sea-salt, the first-time director Matthew L\u00f3pez gets us rooting for the cheeky couple's transition from rivals to romantic bedfellows, boosted by the cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, who photographs the leads so adoringly that you half-expect them to turn to the camera and hawk a bottle of cologne. Thanks to their playful chemistry, we're sold.\" She, however, criticized several \"over-florid theatrical flourishes\". The Observer's Wendy Ide awarded the film three out of five stars, dubbing it \"so slick and polished, it feels obsessively micro-managed rather than directed.\" However, she praised the charisma of Zakhar Perez and Galitzine and credited it for the film's appeal: \"It turns out that watching two impossibly beautiful boys making cow eyes at each other might be just the escapist pulp we need right now.\"",
        "New York Post's Lauren Sarner thought that the film \"has some big flaws, but it's fun and cute rom-com with heart\". She criticized Thurman's performance (dubbing it \"career-worst\"), her Texan accent and the writing of her character, but praised Zakhar Perez's and Galitzine's performances. Sarner also took note of resemblance between Prince Henry and Prince Harry; both princes are spares and their romances with their American lovers lead to strained relationships with their older brothers. Jessie Thompson of The Independent awarded it three out of five stars, summarizing it as \"wry and witty at first, but then becomes unstuck as it enters into soap opera mode\", additionally drawing comparisons with The Crown and Prince Harry's media tour, and taking note of an \"air of liberal fantasy to it all\". She characterized the casting of Zakhar Perez and Galitzine as \"absurdly [good] ... like cartoon Disney princes made into humans\", and Thurman's performance as \"delightfully camp\".",
        "The Guardian's Benjamin Lee awarded it two out of five stars and dubbed it \"well-intentioned yet listless\", writing: \"Red, White and Royal Blue just isn't the fun, brain-disengaged romp it could have been, any praise going toward intention rather than execution.\" BBC's Louis Staples thought that the \"creaky\" formulaic script \"often sounds like it was written by ChatGPT\", criticized the film's overt leaning into \"fictionalised specifics of Anglo-American relations\" and into stereotypes of the British and Americans. He negatively compared it to The Princess Diaries (2001), Single All the Way (2021), The Knight Before Christmas (2019), Fire Island (2022) and Bros (2022), before concluding, \"If you're looking for a film about beautiful men with perfect hair and sculpted abs, which doesn't demand too much from you, then it might be for you. But if you're expecting it to be in the grade of romcoms that are laugh-out-loud hilarious and actually say something interesting about relationships \u2013 or anything beyond lazy clich\u00e9s \u2013 then you'll be royally disappointed.\""
