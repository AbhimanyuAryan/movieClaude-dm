J. Palacio. Serving as both a prequel and sequel to Wonder (2017), the film stars Ariella Glaser, Orlando Schwerdt, Bryce Gheisar, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Mirren, with Gheisar reprising his role as Julian from Wonder.\nWhite Bird was released in EU (Italy, Slovenia, Croatia) on 4 January 2024; it is scheduled to be released in the United States by Lionsgate on October 4, 2024.[3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAfter the events of Wonder, Julian has left Beecher Prep for good. He is visited by his grandmother Sara (whose professional name is Grandm\u00e8re) from Paris, who, in response to Julian's reflection about his need to be socially passive in order to fit in at his new school, tells him about her childhood as a young Jewish girl in Nazi-occupied France during World War II.\nIn 1942, Sara evades being rounded up by the German troops and spends more than one year being hidden by her classmate Julien (one of whose legs is congenitally paralysed by poliomyelitis) in a barn of the house where he lives with his parents. She is instructed never to leave the barn to prevent being discovered by the neighbours suspected of being informants for the Germans. At night Julien teaches Sara what he has learned at school during the day. Affection between  them grows into love.\nIn 1944 after liberation of Monte Cassino, Julien is stopped on his way to school at a German checkpoint by the Milice and thrown into the back of a lorry for transportation to a remote camp in the mountains. During an escape attempt by the other prisoners, he is shot dead. At the end of the war Sara is reunited with her father, her mother has been killed at KZ Auschwitz.\n\nCast[edit]\nHelen Mirren as Grandm\u00e8re, a renowned artist\nAriella Glaser as Sara, Grandm\u00e8re's younger self, a young Jewish girl living in Nazi-occupied France\nOrlando Schwerdt as Julien, Sara's polio-lamed classmate, in the barn of whose family Sara hides from the Germans\nBryce Gheisar as Julian\nGillian Anderson as Vivienne, Julien's mother\nJo Stone-Fewings as Jean-Paul, Julien's father\nPatsy Ferran as Mille Petitjean, Sara and Julien's teacher\nStuart McQuarrie as Pastor Luc, the headmaster of Sara and Julien's school\nOlivia Ross as Rose, Sara's mother\nIshai Golan as Max, Sara's father\nJem Matthews as Vincent, on whom Sara initially has a crush and who later turns into a rabid anti-Semite and joins Milice\nJordan Cramond as Jerome\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn October 2019, Lionsgate acquired the rights to R.J. Palacio's White Bird: A Wonder Story. Palacio said \"[t]he team at Lionsgate values artists and storytellers and has been crucial to expanding the fan community surrounding Wonder. They have been enormously supportive as I have been writing White Bird and I could not feel more secure that my new graphic novel is in the right creative hands at the right studio.\"[4] The film is produced by Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman from Mandeville Films. Jeffrey Skoll and Robert Kissel from Participant executive produce. Marc Forster was announced as director with Mark Bomback writing and executive producing.[5][6]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn February 2021, Bryce Gheisar was confirmed to reprise his role as Julian from the 2017 film Wonder, while Helen Mirren, Gillian Anderson, Orlando Schwerdt and Ariella Glaser joined the cast.[7]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced in February 2021 in the Czech Republic.[8]\n\nLocations gallery\n\n\n\nJungmannovo Square, Kutna Hora, Czech Republic doubles as WWII France\n\n\n\nJungmannovo Square, Kutna Hora, Czech Republic doubles as WWII France\n\n\nRelease[edit]\nWhite Bird: A Wonder Story was initially scheduled to be released on September 16, 2022,[9] but was later delayed to October 14, 2022.[10] In September 2022, Lionsgate removed the film from its release schedule.[11] The film, presented as a \"sneak preview\", premiered at the 43rd San Francisco Jewish Film Festival on July 30, 2023, with a taped introduction by producer Lieberman.[1]\nIn January 2023, it was announced White Bird was scheduled to debut in a limited release on August 18, 2023, followed by a wide release on August 25, 2023.[12] However, in July 2023, as a result of the SAG-AFTRA strike, Lionsgate pushed the release to an unspecified date in the fourth quarter of 2023.[13] In December 2023, Lionsgate redated the film for October 4, 2024.[14]\nWhite Bird was released in Italy, Croatia and Slovenia on January 4, 2024.[3]\n\nReception[edit]\nWriting for Variety, Dennis Harvey gave the film a positive review, saying that \"Marc Forster\u2019s film elevates somewhat contrived material with tastefully lyrical craftsmanship\" and further adding,[15]\n\nThough the occasional preachy, maudlin or trite note remains, Foster also manages to make \u201cWhite Bird\u201d less conspicuously conceived for tweens. He arrives at an unhurried yet sufficiently suspenseful pace that engrosses while side-stepping excess melodrama and sentimentality.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"White Bird\".
