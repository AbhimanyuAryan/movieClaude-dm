    "Plot": [
        "In a world of anthropomorphic animals, Zhi (Jimmy O. Yang) is a slow loris living with his grandmother in a rural Chinese village. As a child, his idol is cane toad racer Archie Vainglorious (John Cleese), but as a young adult he discovers Vainglorious Industries' plans to demolish his village and put in cane toad housing. Initially hopeful that he can reach an understanding with Vainglorious, Zhi instead finds him boastful and dismissive. Vainglorious does, however, agree to challenge Zhi in an upcoming rally race for the fate of the village.",
        "Gnash (J. K. Simmons), a retired goat racer-turned-mechanic, reluctantly agrees to help Zhi train, out of a sense of duty to Zhi's deceased mother. Gnash also provides Zhi with a car and rides with him in it. The race has no rules, and Zhi discovers the deep-pocketed Vainglorious is willing to cheat and play dirty at every opportunity. Zhi also struggles with performance anxiety when he's in the lead, something Gnash struggles to talk him out of.",
        "During downtime between the stages of the race, Zhi meets and then falls in love with Shelby (Chloe Bennet), a fellow slow loris. Unbeknownst to him, she's working for Vainglorious and feeding the latter the information Zhi tells her. Discovering that she shares Zhi's romantic feelings, Shelby feels increasingly torn over her duplicity, and finally breaks with Vainglorious.",
        "With help from the other racers, who are sympathetic to him, Zhi is able to defeat Vainglorious and save his village. Vainglorious throws a fit and then has to face the wrath of his family, who had a financial stake in him winning the race."

    "Production": [
        "During the producion of Charming, Venokur came up with the film's idea and planned to make a koala as the main character. He changed the lead character into a slow loris in order to focus the idea of a \"slow-moving animal who wants to be a race car driver\".",
        "The film took over three years to be made. Animation was handled by ReDefine with a team of over 200 artists. Pre-production, storyboard and compositing were done at Montreal facilities, animation and lighting were done in Mumbai, and post-production in London. The film was animated using Maya and rendered on Clarisse.  Visual effects supervisor Alexei Nechytaylo cited films like Rush and Senna as influences for the racing scenes, and well spent several days in Shanghai to study settings and Chinese culture."
