But Grimcutty has a strong cast in its favor, and derives some scary-adjacent chills from setting its main baddie loose to grimly grab at teens in trouble.\"[11]\nMatt Donato of Paste gave Grimcutty a grade of 5.5 out of 10, and said the film \"works itself backward into a forgettable cyber-folktale fate.\"[12] Shrija Ganguly of Sportskeeda stated that Grimcutty has \"some good horror content,\" and complimented the performance of Usman Ally, but stated that the film has too many loopholes.[13] Lindsay Traves of Pajiba asserted that the film is \"born of an interesting idea,\" but said that the execution was \"unfortunately boring.\"[14] Kyle McWilliams of Mashable said that the \"scares are overshadowed by over-explanation,\" writing, \"If the movie trusted its audience more in collecting the thematic goods, there could be space to discover even deeper horrors within the depths of online culture. Instead, the spoon-feeding approach kills the thrills and the fun.\"[15]\nJoe Lipsett of Bloody Disgusting gave the film a grade of 2 out of 5 and complimented the performance of Sara Wolfkind, but called it a \"messy film, complete with substantial logic gaps, more than one scenery-chewing performance, and a run time that isn\u2019t earned by its relatively thin, repetitive script.\"[16] Brian Costello of Common Sense Media gave Grimcutty a grade of 2 out of 5, said the presence of positive messages is almost non-existent, and noted the absence of positive role models across the characters.[17] Loric C. of Ready Steady Cut gave Grimcutty a grade of 1.5 out of 5 and found the movie to be a \"weak offering to the horror genre.\"[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Thibodeau, Jennifer (November 2022). \"Wildly different Huluween offerings: Grimcutty and Matriarch\".
