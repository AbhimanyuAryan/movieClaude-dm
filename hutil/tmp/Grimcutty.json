        "Yael Tygiel of Collider included Grimcutty in their \"Best Movies on Hulu Right Now\" list, and described it as a \"grizzly and terrifying movie.\" Mike Mack of Laughing Place called the film a \"fine watch if you\u2019re looking for something new,\" complimenting the story and the performances of the actors. Sean Shuman of MovieWeb asserted, \"Grimcutty may not be a perfect movie, but it's an interesting encapsulation of just how quickly misinformation can wreak havoc, even if it's spread with good intentions.\" Johnny Loftus of Decider said, \"It\u2019s too long, and a character checking a phone or their email will never be as compelling to watch as Hollywood wants it to be. But Grimcutty has a strong cast in its favor, and derives some scary-adjacent chills from setting its main baddie loose to grimly grab at teens in trouble.\"",
        "Matt Donato of Paste gave Grimcutty a grade of 5.5 out of 10, and said the film \"works itself backward into a forgettable cyber-folktale fate.\" Shrija Ganguly of Sportskeeda stated that Grimcutty has \"some good horror content,\" and complimented the performance of Usman Ally, but stated that the film has too many loopholes. Lindsay Traves of Pajiba asserted that the film is \"born of an interesting idea,\" but said that the execution was \"unfortunately boring.\" Kyle McWilliams of Mashable said that the \"scares are overshadowed by over-explanation,\" writing, \"If the movie trusted its audience more in collecting the thematic goods, there could be space to discover even deeper horrors within the depths of online culture. Instead, the spoon-feeding approach kills the thrills and the fun.\"",
        "Joe Lipsett of Bloody Disgusting gave the film a grade of 2 out of 5 and complimented the performance of Sara Wolfkind, but called it a \"messy film, complete with substantial logic gaps, more than one scenery-chewing performance, and a run time that isn\u2019t earned by its relatively thin, repetitive script.\" Brian Costello of Common Sense Media gave Grimcutty a grade of 2 out of 5, said the presence of positive messages is almost non-existent, and noted the absence of positive role models across the characters. Loric C. of Ready Steady Cut gave Grimcutty a grade of 1.5 out of 5 and found the movie to be a \"weak offering to the horror genre.\""
