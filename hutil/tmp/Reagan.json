        "In 2010, it was announced producer Mark Joseph would be producing a feature film biopic of Ronald Reagan with Joseph having been inspired to take on such a project after reacting to the miniseries The Reagans with distaste. Screenwriter Jonas McCord had initially been uninterested in the project, but changed his mind after deciding that Reagan's childhood and formative years were very dramatically rich.",
        "Klausner and McCord wrote the script based on a book by Paul Kengor: The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism. Kengor described the script's development as faithful to both his books and history.",
        "In 2012, Jon Voight was in discussions to portray Viktor Novikov, whom Kengor said \"is actually a character based on a number of KGB agents and Soviet analysts who we now know were tasked with keeping tabs on Ronald Reagan for many years\".",
        "In August 2016, it was reported Sean McNamara, who had worked as a sound engineer at the age of 18 during filming of Reagan\u2019s inauguration ceremony in 1981, had signed on to direct. John G. Avildsen had been in negotiations to direct prior to his death.",
        "Joseph had trouble securing financing for the film with several deals made before production actually started, only for the money to never actually come through. This lead to Joseph turning to outside independent financing which made up the film's $25 million budget.",
        "Principal photography began on September 9, 2020. Filming locations included Guthrie, Oklahoma. It was announced on October 22, 2020, that filming had shut down after several crew members tested positive for COVID-19 in the midst of the ongoing pandemic. Filming resumed on November 5, 2020.",
        "The film was originally due to be released in 2021 but was then delayed to an unknown date."
