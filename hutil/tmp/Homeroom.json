    "Reception": [
        "The review round-up at Rotten Tomatoes for Homeroom had 85% of critics recommending the film, based on 47 reviews and an average rating of 7 out of 10. The critics consensus reads: \"Homeroom offers an encouraging -- and engaging -- look at young people preparing to leave high school behind and shape the future.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generaly favourable reviews\". Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \"You don't need heavy-handed foreshadowing to know that the class of 2020 is the COVID Class, to realize that the prom the bright-faced teens are looking forward to will never happen, that the graduation they're aiming for will be virtual, that the production of In the Heights scheduled to open on March 20 is never going to see its curtain raised. Homeroom is, in that sense, an inspiring tragedy, a portrait of resilient youth in unprecedented circumstances, the sort of thing that hasn't yet oversaturated Sundance, but probably eventually will.",
