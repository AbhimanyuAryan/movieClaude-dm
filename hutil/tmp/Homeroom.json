Ryan Coogler and Davis Guggenheim, the latter of whom made a similar film, Waiting for \"Superman\", were executive producers on this film.[2][3]\nThe film was premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 29, 2021, where it was the inaugural winner of the Jonathan Oppenheim Editing Award - U.S. Documentary. It was released on Hulu on August 12, 2021.[4]\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nThe film follows the students of Oakland High School's Class of 2020 as they face an unprecented year. Anxiety over test scores and college applications is giving way to uncertainty over a rapidly developing pandemic.\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 29, 2021. On April 20, 2021, Hulu acquired the film's U.S. distribution rights and set it for an August 12, 2021 release.[5]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nThe review round-up at Rotten Tomatoes for Homeroom had 85% of critics recommending the film, based on 47 reviews and an average rating of 7 out of 10. The critics consensus reads: \"Homeroom offers an encouraging -- and engaging -- look at young people preparing to leave high school behind and shape the future.\"[6] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generaly favourable reviews\".[7] Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \"You don't need heavy-handed foreshadowing to know that the class of 2020 is the COVID Class, to realize that the prom the bright-faced teens are looking forward to will never happen, that the graduation they're aiming for will be virtual, that the production of In the Heights scheduled to open on March 20 is never going to see its curtain raised. Homeroom is, in that sense, an inspiring tragedy, a portrait of resilient youth in unprecedented circumstances, the sort of thing that hasn't yet oversaturated Sundance, but probably eventually will.[8]\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote:\n\n\"Nicks takes a verit\u00e9 approach to his subject, documenting students through the ups and downs of their final year in high school at a distance, letting them tell their own stories. The focus of the first half falls on a debate that would echo \u201cDefund the Police\u201d months later as students and community members fight the board about removing police officers from Oakland High School. Like a bit too much of \u201cHomeroom,\u201d I could have watched these board meetings for hours, Wiseman-style. The debate over adults who think that officers keep their kids safe opposite students telling them that uniforms don\u2019t equal safety for a lot of young people is fascinating. And it\u2019s wonderful to hear these young people discuss their concerns so openly, even if a lot of them seem to often fall on deaf ears.\"[9]\nLisa Kennedy of Variety wrote:\n\n\"The Oakland students \u2014 and director Nicks \u2014 rise to the demands of overlapping crises. With its vibrant if abbreviated portraits and final scenes of burgeoning activism, \u201cHomeroom\u201d suggest that kids may not be alright, but they are very much on the case.\"[10]\nSee also[edit]\n\nUnited States portalSchools portalFilm portal\nWaiting for \"Superman\"\nOakland High School\nOakland Unified School District\nEducation in the United States\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Homeroom\".
