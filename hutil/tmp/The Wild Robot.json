The film was written and directed by Chris Sanders, produced by Jeff Hermann, and executive produced by Sanders' longtime collaborative partner Dean DeBlois. It stars Lupita Nyong'o as Roz, the title character, alongside an ensemble voice cast including Pedro Pascal, Kit Connor, Bill Nighy, Stephanie Hsu, Mark Hamill, and Catherine O'Hara.\nDreamWorks announced an animated film adaptation of the book series The Wild Robot in September 2023, with Sanders, Hermann, and DeBlois attached. It will be the final film to be animated entirely in-house at DreamWorks, as it was reported in October 2023 that the studio would be shifting away from producing films in-house to rely more heavily on outside studios after 2024. Kris Bowers will compose the film's score. \nThe Wild Robot is scheduled to be theatrically released on September 20, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nThe epic adventure follows the journey of a robot\u2014ROZZUM unit 7134, \u201cRoz\u201d for short \u2014 that is shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must learn to adapt to the harsh surroundings, gradually building relationships with the animals on the island and becoming the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling.\u2014\u200aDreamWorks Animation[1]\nVoice cast[edit]\nLupita Nyong'o as Roz[2]\nPedro Pascal as Fink[2]\nCatherine O'Hara as Pinktail[2]\nBill Nighy as Longneck[2]\nKit Connor as Brightbill[2]\nStephanie Hsu as Vontra[2]\nAdditionally, Mark Hamill, Matt Berry and Ving Rhames have been cast in undisclosed roles.[2]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nOn September 28, 2023, DreamWorks Animation announced an animated film adaptation of the book series The Wild Robot by Peter Brown, with Chris Sanders writing and directing, Jeff Hermann producing, and Sanders' longtime creative collaborator Dean DeBlois executive producing. Other crew members were revealed, including production designer Raymond Zibach, editor Mary Blee, and head of story Heidi Jo Gilbert.[3]\nOn March 5, 2024, with the release of the film's first trailer, Lupita Nyong'o, Pedro Pascal, Catherine O'Hara, Bill Nighy, Kit Connor, Stephanie Hsu, Mark Hamill, Matt Berry, and Ving Rhames were announced to be starring in the film.[2][4]\n\nAnimation and design[edit]\nThe Wild Robot will be the final film to be animated entirely in-house at DreamWorks, as Cartoon Brew reported on October 6, 2023 that the studio would be shifting away from producing films in-house in their Glendale campus to rely more heavily on outside studios after 2024.[5]\n\nMusic[edit]\nKris Bowers will compose the film's score, marking his first score for an animated film.[6]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe first trailer for the film, featuring a rendition of Reuben and the Dark's cover of \"What a Wonderful World\", and poster, were released on March 5, 2024.[7] The trailer would debut in theaters three days later in front of the screenings of Kung Fu Panda 4.[8] Writing for Polygon, Tasha Robinson compared the design of Roz to familiar film robots such as BB-8, WALL-E, Baymax, and The Iron Giant, and notes that the only words spoken in the trailer - \"Sometimes, to survive, we must become more than we were programmed to be\" - evoked the message of The Iron Giant (1999).[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Wild Robot is scheduled to be released on September 20, 2024.[10]\nAs part of Universal's deal with Netflix, the film will stream on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Netflix for the next ten, and returning to Peacock for the remaining four.[11][12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Wild Robot\".
