Peter Safran and James Wan return as producers.\nIn 2017, Wan discussed the possibility of a Nun sequel and by 2019, Safran revealed that the film was in early development. Cooper was initially hired as the sole writer, before Goldberg and Naing contributed as screenwriters to the final script. Chaves, who had previously helmed The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021) and The Curse of La Llorona (2019), was announced as director. Principal photography began in October 2022 in France.\nThe Nun II was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on September 8, 2023. The film was a commercial success, grossing $269 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1956, Father Noiret and young Jacques perform their daily chores in their church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death before a terrified Jacques who then flees.\nFour years following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her teacher and mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe (including that of Father Burke), attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice who expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.\n\nA version of the Saint Lucy by Italian painter Beccafumi is shown in some sequences\nIn Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak and has a strange vision. Sister Debra tells Irene that she received Noiret's rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak in the guise of her deceased son.\nIrene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery then became the present-day boarding school.\nAt the school, Irene and Debra face off against a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women the stained-glass goat in the chapel and they use a flashlight to make its eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser-like pointer, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.\nAs the goat attacks the students, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Similar to Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene in the air and sets her ablaze. Irene does not burn as Valak realizes she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray the Words of Institution as the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon and freeing Maurice of possession.\nThe next morning, Irene leads Maurice outside and helps him to regain his senses. However, she becomes concerned as she watches him going with Sophie and Kate inside.\n\nCast[edit]\nTaissa Farmiga as Sister Irene[7]\nJonas Bloquet as Maurice[8]\nStorm Reid as Sister Debra[9]\nAnna Popplewell as Kate[10]\nBonnie Aarons as The Demon Nun\nKatelyn Rose Downey as Sophie[10]\nSuzanne Bertish as Madame Laurent\nL\u00e9ontine d'Oncieu as Simone\nAnouk Darwin Homewood as Celeste\nMaxime Elias-Menet as Jacques\nPascal Aubert as Father Noiret\nDavid Horovitch as Cardinal Conroy\nKate Colebrook as Irene's Mom / Saint Lucy\nAndrew Morgado provides the demonic voice\nAdditionally, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively in the mid-credits scene, using archived footage from The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.[11]\n\nProduction[edit]\nFormer Couvent des Pr\u00eacheurs monastery in Aix-en-Provence, the location of the boarding school in the film.\nArc de Boqui in Tarascon, one of the filming locations.\nChapelle des Ursulines\u00a0[fr] aka. Chapelle Sainte Catherine de Sienne in Aix-en-Provence portrays the church of Tarascon in the film.\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn August 2017, Wan discussed the possibility of a Nun sequel and what its story may be: \"I do know where potentially, if The Nun works out, where The Nun 2 could lead to and how that ties back to Lorraine's story that we've set up with the first two Conjurings and make it all come full circle.\"[12]\nIn April 2019, it was announced by Peter Safran that a sequel was in development. Safran stated that there was a \"really fun\" storyline planned for the film and commented that there was an \"inevitability to another The Nun movie\".[13] Later that month, Akela Cooper signed onto the project as screenwriter while Safran and James Wan agreed to serve as producers.[14]\nIn February 2022, Taissa Farmiga stated that she had had discussions with Warner Bros. Pictures to reprise her role from the first film while stating that the restrictions on the film industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had delayed the project.[15] In April 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures officially announced the movie as a part of its upcoming slate at the 2022 CinemaCon.[16] The following day, it was announced that Michael Chaves would direct the film.[17]\nIn September 2022, it was revealed that Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing had contributed as screenwriting co-authors of the most recent draft of the script.[18]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn April 2022, James Wan confirmed that Bonnie Aarons would be reprising her role as Valak.[19] In September 2022, Storm Reid was cast as a new lead.[18][20] In October 2022, Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet were confirmed to be reprising their roles from the first film, with Anna Popplewell and Katelyn Rose Downey added to the cast later that month.[21][22][10][8]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPreliminary production photography began on April 29, 2022.[23][24] Filming was originally scheduled to start on September 5, 2022.[25][6] Principal photography began in France on October 6, 2022,[26] and concluded later that year.[27] Filming locations include the former Couvent des Pr\u00eacheurs\u00a0[fr] monastery in Aix-en-Provence and rue Proudhon in Tarascon.[28]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Nun II was theatrically released in the United States on September 8, 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema.[29]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe Nun II was released on digital download on October 3, 2023, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on November 14, 2023, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[30]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe Nun II grossed $86.3\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $183.2\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $269.5\u00a0million.[4][5]\nIn the United States, The Nun II was released alongside My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, and was projected to gross $31\u201334 million from 3,728 theaters in its opening weekend.[31] The film made $13 million on its first day, including $3.1 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $32.6 million, topping the box office.[3] In its second weekend the film made $14.5 million, dropping 55.4% and topping newcomer A Haunting in Venice ($14.3 million).[32] The film made $8.6 million in its third weekend, topping the box office again whilst narrowly defeating another new release, The Expendables 4 ($8.4 million).[33]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of 139 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Scarier than its predecessor, The Nun II makes for an entertaining addition to the Conjuring franchise despite not being the most original horror sequel.\"[34] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale (up from the first film's \"C\"), while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 64% overall positive score, with 47% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[3]\nFrank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The filmmaker does a fine job creating a suitably ominous atmosphere (the old-world European locations and Tristan Nyby's gloomy cinematography really help) and orchestrates the violent mayhem, much of it involving terrified little girls, with disturbing relish.\"[36] The Times's Ed Potton gave the film 3/5 stars, saying it \"often flirts with ridiculousness\", but praised Chaves's direction, Farmiga and Downey's performances and the finale.[37] CNN's Brian Lowry called the film \"a slick if familiar addition to the very fertile Conjuring universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit.\"[38] Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \"In some respects an improvement on its predecessor, in others not, this is finally one more good-enough if unmemorable entry sure to extend the series' life in lucrative fashion.\"[39]\nBob Smithouser of Plugged In stated that \"The Nun II is one of the purest cinematic versions of palpable image over substance that I've seen in some time.\"[40] Claire Shaffer of The New York Times said the film \"runs like haunted clockwork, shoving characters down dark alleyways or abandoned chapels every five minutes with little justification. Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then \u2026 not much else, in most cases.\"[41] The Sydney Morning Herald's Jake Wilson gave it 2/5 stars, writing, \"The shocks are brief and not too grisly, the dingy Gothic look is as you'd expect, and the mechanical climax steers clear of the more unsettling possibilities that might have emerged if Frenchie's Jekyll and Hyde sides had been meaningfully linked.\"[42] Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press gave it 1/5 stars, writing, \"A new directing and writing team fails to shock or scare with a color-by-numbers plot and a meandering, languid wannabe frightfest.\"[43]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nThe film was nominated in the category of Outstanding Effects Simulations in a Photoreal Feature at the 22nd Visual Effects Society Awards.[44]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Marco Beltrami scoring Michael Chaves' 'The Nun 2'\".
