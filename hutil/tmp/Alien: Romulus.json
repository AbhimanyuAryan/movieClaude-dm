        "After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by the Walt Disney Company, it was officially confirmed at the 2019 CinemaCon that future Alien films are in development. In March 2022, it was announced that Fede \u00c1lvarez would be writing and directing the film after pitching his own story, and was said to be \"unconnected\" to the previous films in the franchise, with the project set to be released on Hulu in the United States. By November, Cailee Spaeny had entered negotiations to star. In March 2023, Isabela Merced was cast in an undisclosed role, set to co-star opposite Spaeny. Later that month, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn, and Aileen Wu joined the cast in undisclosed roles. In November 2023, it was announced that the film would take place between Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), with some technical crew members returning from the latter film.",
