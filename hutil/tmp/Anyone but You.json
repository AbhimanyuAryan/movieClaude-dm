Loosely based on Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare,[4] it stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell. The supporting cast includes Alexandra Shipp, GaTa, Hadley Robinson, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Darren Barnet, Bryan Brown, and Rachel Griffiths.\nAnyone but You premiered in AMC Lincoln Square Theater on December 11, 2023, and was released theatrically in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on December 22, 2023. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $219 million worldwide.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nWhile trying to secure a restroom key at a coffee shop, Boston University law student Bea meets Goldman Sachs employee Ben. The two have an instant connection and spend the day together, ultimately falling asleep on Ben's couch. She leaves without waking him in the morning, but reconsiders and returns to the apartment, only to overhear him insulting her while talking to his friend Pete. Shifting back to Ben, who was incredibly hurt by this decision of Bea leaving, he gets up and decides to look at the \u201cgiant wrench\u201d that he decided to tell her about. He does not tell anyone about his mom, although he did tell her because he knew she was special. Ben decides to tell Pete that he could not get her off him. When Bea is about to go back inside to talk to him, like her sister, Halle, advised her to, she is distraught by this dialogue. As Ben continues to degrade her to Pete, Bea turns around and leaves with her thoughts gathered about him. As she walks through Boston, she collects herself.[4]\nBea and Ben do not see each other again for six months, crossing paths when Bea's sister, Halle, begins dating Pete's sister, Claudia. The two are frosty toward each other, each blaming the other for their date ending poorly. Halle and Claudia later become engaged, and plan a wedding in Sydney.\nBea, who has broken up with her fianc\u00e9 Jonathan and secretly dropped out of law school, is dismayed to find that Ben is not only on the same flight to Australia as her, but that they will both be staying at Claudia and Pete's parents' house in the days leading up to the wedding. Bea and Ben's disdain for each other begins to frustrate the other members of the wedding party, compounded by the appearances of both Bea's and Ben's exes, Jonathan and Margaret, respectively.\nWhile Bea's parents attempt to push her to reconcile with Jonathan, the other attendees devise a plan to get Bea and Ben together to ensure the wedding goes off smoothly. Bea quickly sees through the scheme, and makes a deal with Ben to pretend that they are together in order to both make Margaret jealous and stop Bea's parents pushing her to make up with Jonathan.\nEarly efforts to sell the relationship are unsuccessful until a party on a boat, where Bea and Ben dance together and reenact a scene from Titanic, which ends in Bea falling into Sydney Harbour. Ben jumps in after Bea, and they have a conversation while waiting for rescue on a buoy. She tells him that she has withdrawn from law school, and they make a date to sightsee at the Sydney Opera House. They return to the house and have sex, but Bea suggests offhandedly that her recent actions have all been mistakes, which disappoints Ben. He slips away in the early hours of the morning, disheartening Bea.\nThe morning of the wedding, Margaret asks Bea for her blessing to rekindle things with Ben. Bea accepts, claiming that she was only situationally involved with him. Through a conversation with Pete, Ben indirectly reveals to Bea's parents that she has secretly quit law school, leaving her feeling betrayed.\nAfter overhearing Halle and Claudia arguing, Ben convinces Bea to pretend to reconcile for the sake of the wedding. The ceremony goes smoothly, but Bea sees Margaret kissing Ben during the reception and leaves in tears, heading to the Opera House. However, Ben rejects Margaret and says that he no longer has feelings for her as he was wrongfully stuck on a memory. The wedding guests convince him to chase after Bea, so he jumps off a nearby cliff and into the Pacific Ocean, then convinces the rescue helicopter that retrieves him to fly him to the Opera House.\nBen apologizes to Bea, telling her that he left because he feared their relationship could become another regret. They reconcile and return to the reception as a couple, where Halle and Claudia reveal that their argument was yet another ruse to push Bea and Ben toward each other. Meanwhile, Jonathan and Margaret get together.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nSydney Sweeney as Bea\nGlen Powell as Ben\nAlexandra Shipp as Claudia\nGaTa as Pete\nHadley Robinson as Halle\nMichelle Hurd as Carol\nDermot Mulroney as Leo\nDarren Barnet as Jonathan\nBryan Brown as Roger\nRachel Griffiths as Innie\nCharlee Fraser as Margaret\nJoe Davidson as Beau\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment and casting[edit]\nIt was announced in January 2023 that Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell would star in the then-untitled film to be directed by Will Gluck.[5] Alexandra Shipp, Michelle Hurd, Bryan Brown, Darren Barnet and Hadley Robinson joined the cast in February,[6][7] with the additions of Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths and GaTa announced the following month.[8][9]\n\nFilming[edit]\nFilming began in New South Wales in February 2023,[10] and filming in Sydney was noted in March 2023.[11] In May, the film was titled Anyone but You.[12] The score was provided by Este Haim and Chris Stracey.[13]\nDuring production, a scene involving a rescue helicopter almost went wrong due to mechanical issues, requiring an emergency landing.[14] In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Sweeney revealed another incident that had happened during production; while filming the spider scene, the trained huntsman spider that was used actually bit her.[15]\n\nRelease[edit]\nAnyone but You premiered at AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City on December 11, 2023,[16] and was released by Sony Pictures Releasing in the United States and Canada on December 22, 2023.[17] In response to the success at the box office, Sony Pictures released an extended version of the film in theaters on February 9, 2024, ahead of Valentine's Day.[18]\nAnyone but You was released on digital platforms on February 20, 2024,[19] and on Blu-ray on March 12, 2024.[20]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nAs of April\u00a018, 2024[update], Anyone but You has grossed $88.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $130.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $219 million.[2][3]\nIn the United States and Canada, Anyone but You was released alongside Migration, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and The Iron Claw, and was projected to gross around $7 million from 3,055 theaters in its four-day opening weekend.[21] The film made $3.5 million on its first day, including $1.2 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $6.3 million, finishing fourth at the box office.[22] In its second weekend the film made $8.8 million, finishing fifth at the box office.[23] In its third weekend the film made $9.5 million (an increase of 9%), finishing fifth again,[24] before making $7.1 million and finishing in fourth the following week.[25]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 55% of 101 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Slick direction and a pair of tremendously watchable stars make Anyone But You a passably fizzy diversion despite a less than scintillating story.\"[26] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[27] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an average of four out of five stars, with 57% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[22]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominee(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2024\n\nPeople's Choice Awards\n\nComedy Movie of the Year\n\nAnyone but You\n\nNominated\n\n[28]\n\n\nComedy Movie Star of the Year\n\nSydney Sweeney\n\nNominated\n\n\nGlen Powell\n\nNominated\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nOutstanding Film \u2014 Wide Theatrical Release\n\nAnyone but You\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Anyone But You (15)\".
