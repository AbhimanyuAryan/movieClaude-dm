The bad guys are taken out in the ensuing gun fight, but Baker inadvertently kills three hostages. As a result of PTSD-induced hallucinations and nightmares, caused by the killing of the innocent, Baker gets sent home to recover.\nAt this time, his family makes an unexpected discovery in their house - a stash of money worth $3 million. Baker just happens to live, with his wife Lisa (Aris Mej\u00eda) and  their two teenage daughters, in the house where career criminal Johnny (Mickey Rourke) stashed his loot. The Baker family soon faces the danger and threat of freshly sprung Johnny, who quickly reunites with his old crew to retake the $3 million of stolen money he hid before his arrest. Johnny is \u00fcber-badass, just before his release, he \"dealt\" with three inmates who tried to shank him right before he was freed.\nEventually, James and Lisa head off for a quiet weekend together, leaving their two daughters home alone. The youngest girl promptly organizes a house party. It is during this party that Johnny's goons stage a home invasion.\nJohnny and his henchmen will do whatever it takes to retrieve the money, including kidnap Baker's daughters. Stakes are high in this head-to-head battle as Baker stops at nothing to protect his family against the money-hungry criminals. There are many confrontations, but none of them between Baker and Johnny, until the final minutes.\nOne of the highlights is a high schooler getting shot while taking a leak and peeing all over his killer.\n\nProduction[edit]\nCasting[edit]\nIn September 2020, it was announced that Rourke was cast in the film.[2][3] In October 2020, White joined the cast of the film.[4]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography occurred in New Mexico on October and November 2020.[1]\n\nRelease[edit]\nOn December 7, 2021, Saban Films released a trailer for the film and set it for a January 7, 2022 release.[5]\n\nReception[edit]\nRene Rodriguez of Variety gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"A talky and lethargic home-invasion thriller, The Commando amounts to an inept crime drama stuffed with banal dialogue and irrelevant supporting characters to pad its feature-length running time.\"[6]\nLeslie Felperin of The Guardian awarded the film one star out of five and wrote, \"The Commando contains a number of egregious implausibilities and cliches.\"[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Gomez, Adrian. \"Making waves: Filmmaker's upcoming projects put New Mexico into the spotlight\".
