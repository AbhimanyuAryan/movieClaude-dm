    "Plot": [
        "A DEA SWAT team, led by elite DEA agent James Baker (Michael Jai White), assault a Mexican cartel's drug lab. The bad guys are taken out in the ensuing gun fight, but Baker inadvertently kills three hostages. As a result of PTSD-induced hallucinations and nightmares, caused by the killing of the innocent, Baker gets sent home to recover.",
        "At this time, his family makes an unexpected discovery in their house - a stash of money worth $3 million. Baker just happens to live, with his wife Lisa (Aris Mej\u00eda) and  their two teenage daughters, in the house where career criminal Johnny (Mickey Rourke) stashed his loot. The Baker family soon faces the danger and threat of freshly sprung Johnny, who quickly reunites with his old crew to retake the $3 million of stolen money he hid before his arrest. Johnny is \u00fcber-badass, just before his release, he \"dealt\" with three inmates who tried to shank him right before he was freed.",
        "Eventually, James and Lisa head off for a quiet weekend together, leaving their two daughters home alone. The youngest girl promptly organizes a house party. It is during this party that Johnny's goons stage a home invasion.",
        "Johnny and his henchmen will do whatever it takes to retrieve the money, including kidnap Baker's daughters. Stakes are high in this head-to-head battle as Baker stops at nothing to protect his family against the money-hungry criminals. There are many confrontations, but none of them between Baker and Johnny, until the final minutes.",
        "One of the highlights is a high schooler getting shot while taking a leak and peeing all over his killer."
