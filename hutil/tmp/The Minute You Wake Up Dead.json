        "Sheriff Fowler's investigation quickly leads him to Lucius, so Delaine kills her hapless lover\u00a0\u2013 her second murder. Lucius had planned to use his share of the money to pay off local loan shark Jody, and told Jody everything about the murder. When Lucius dies, Jody informs Delaine that she must pay Lucius' debt.",
        "Lucius' body goes missing, and Delaine later finds that Russ has it. He reveals that he overheard Delaine and Russ discussing their crime, and he hid Lucius so that he could protect her from getting caught, and thus become her new equal partner in the insurance settlement. He also reveals that he has killed Fowler for getting too close to solving the original murder. She tells Russ that her father was in pain awaiting his death from stage four cancer, but knew that suicide nullifies his insurance, so he and Delaine staged his murder to swindle the insurance company.",
        "Delaine kills Russ, her third murder, and throws his and Lucius' bodies in the swamp. When they are found the next day, Deputy Sheriff Kane accuses Delaine of being involved, and says he will find the proof. Minutes later Pernie, the secretary for Russ, tells Delaine that Russ told her everything, and demands she now become an equal partner in the insurance fraud. Jody and his thug are still bothering Delaine for the debt Lucius owes, so she arranges for Pernie to murder them both that night, and Delaine murders Pernie the next morning, bringing the death toll to seven in her insurance fraud scheme.",
        "Later that morning, Kane arrests Delaine, and is shocked when she confesses everything\u00a0\u2013 against his original Miranda warning and his follow up suggestion that she shut up\u00a0\u2013 confirming the intelligence of a fraudster mass-murdering waitress in Bare Hollow, Mississippi."
