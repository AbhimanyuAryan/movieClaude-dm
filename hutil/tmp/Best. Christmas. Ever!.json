Christmas. Ever! is a 2023 American Christmas romantic comedy film directed by Mary Lambert and written by Todd Gallicano and Charles Shyer. The film stars Heather Graham, Brandy Norwood, Matt Cede\u00f1o, and Jason Biggs.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nCharlotte and Rob Sanders, living a modest life in a small apartment, feel overshadowed by the seemingly perfect life of Charlotte's college friend, Jackie Jennings. Jackie's annual Christmas letter, detailing her family's extraordinary achievements, incites envy and skepticism in Charlotte.\nCharlotte, feeling her own family is unremarkable, describes her daughter Dora's obsession with Marvel comics, her son Grant's attachment to a stuffed monkey, Rob's impractical dream of house flipping, and her own abandoned inventor dreams. When Grant, misunderstanding his mother's sarcasm, navigates the family to the Jennings' home for Christmas, they find themselves snowed in and forced to stay.\nCharlotte suspects Jackie's family, especially after meeting Jackie's fit, Latino husband, Valentino. Her distrust leads her to snoop around their house. Meanwhile, the children, influenced by Beatrix's skepticism, embark on a misguided mission to expose a mall Santa, culminating in a confrontational scene.\nCharlotte accuses Jackie and Rob of having a secret affair, based on misinterpreted correspondence. This leads to a revelation of Rob's harmless tradition of sharing Jackie's Christmas letters with their family, kept secret due to Charlotte's known disdain for them.\nThe film's climax involves an elaborate solar-powered hot air balloon, a tribute to Jackie's late son, Daniel. A series of events results in a Christmas pageant spectacle, where Santa's sleigh is accidentally attached to the balloon.\nIn the film's epilogue, the Sanders and Jennings families collaborate on a joint Christmas letter. Charlotte boasts about her new invention, while the Jennings promote their non-governmental organization (NGO) through solar-powered hot air balloon travel.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nHeather Graham as Charlotte Sanders[1]\nBrandy Norwood as Jackie Jennings[1]\nJason Biggs as Rob Sanders[1]\nMatt Cede\u00f1o as Valentino[1]\nWyatt Hunt as Grant Sanders\nAbby Villasmil as Dora Sanders\nMadison Skye Validum as Beatrix Jennings\nNadia Sine as Rose McCaffrey\nJanet Lo as Keiko\nRelease[edit]\nBest.
