Based on Gregory Mcdonald's 1976 novel of the same title, it stars Jon Hamm, Lorenza Izzo, Marcia Gay Harden, Kyle MacLachlan, Roy Wood Jr. and John Slattery. It is the third installment in the Fletch series, following Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989), and the first not to star Chevy Chase.\nConfess, Fletch received a limited theatrical release and on premium video on demand on September 16, 2022, before a Showtime premiere on October 28, 2022.[4] It received generally positive reviews.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIrwin Maurice \"Fletch\" Fletcher is apparently sent to Boston from Italy by his girlfriend Angela to recover her father\u2019s multimillion-dollar art collection. The paintings were stolen and are in the possession of an American art dealer named Ronald Horan. Angela\u2019s father is an Italian billionaire count who was apparently kidnapped by the mob demanding his paintings as ransom.\nAs Fletch arrives in a rented town house in Boston, he finds a dead woman, subsequently identified as barista Laurel Goodwin. Despite being the one who called the police, Fletch becomes the prime suspect in the murder. Sergeant Inspector Monroe and Junior Detective Griz of the Boston Police Department begin tailing him. \nFletch meets with Horan under a fake name in an attempt to locate the paintings. He learns from his neighbor Eve that Owen, the town house owner, has a history of violence and drug abuse and an estranged spouse named Tatiana, who used to be his business partner. Fletch meets with Tatiana, again using a fake name, and suspects that she is the killer. \nMeanwhile, the Countess, Angela\u2019s stepmother, invites herself to stay with Fletch. Angela is not happy with this development, as she suspects that the Countess and her brother kidnapped the Count. Angela arrives in Boston and initially appears to be friendly with the Countess.\nAt dinner that night, Fletch, the Countess, and Angela are visited by Owen, Tatiana, and Eve. Laurel Goodwin\u2019s boyfriend arrives and tries to kill Fletch. When the boyfriend is distracted by Eve's dog, Fletch snatches his gun and learns that Angela knows and was in contact with Owen. She abruptly leaves in the middle of the evening.\nFletch follows Angela to a meeting with Horan on his sailboat, assuming that she stole the paintings and transferred them to Horan to sell. Horan reveals that he killed Laurel Goodwin and framed Fletch to eliminate him from the painting transaction. He then planned to deceive Angela and pay off his debts by selling the Count's art collection. Horan pulls a gun and tries to kill Fletch, but is shot dead by Griz. \nThe Count, who faked his kidnapping with Fletch's help as a test of his wife and daughter's love, returns and persuades Fletch to keep the paintings. From an undisclosed location in Latin America, Fletch sends paintings to the Countess, Eve, his previous boss, and two street artists, and a large check to Laurel Goodwin' boyfriend.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJon Hamm as Irwin Maurice \"Fletch\" Fletcher\nRoy Wood Jr. as Sergeant Inspector Monroe\nAyden Mayeri as Junior Detective Griz\nLorenza Izzo as Angela de Grassi a.k.a. \"Andy\"\nKyle MacLachlan as Ronald Horan, a Boston art dealer\nAnnie Mumolo as Eve, Owen's neighbor\nJohn Behlmann as Owen\nJohn Slattery as Frank Jaffe, Fletch's old boss who runs the Boston Sentinel now\nLucy Punch as Tatiana, Owen's ex-wife\nMarcia Gay Harden as \"Contessa\"\nErica McDermott as Detective #3\nEugene Mirman as Yacht Club Security\nKenneth Kimmins as The Commodore\nRobert Picardo as Count de Grassi\nProduction[edit]\nFollowing the release of Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989) starring Chevy Chase, attempts to reboot the series based on the Gregory Mcdonald novels frequently became mired in development hell. Names such as Kevin Smith and Jason Lee,[5] Bill Lawrence and Zach Braff,[6] and Jason Sudeikis[7] were previously attached to the property.\nIn July 2020, it was reported that Jon Hamm would star in and produce an adaptation of the Mcdonald novel Confess, Fletch directed by Greg Mottola.[8] In June 2021, Marcia Gay Harden, Kyle MacLachlan, Roy Wood Jr., and John Slattery joined the cast. Filming began in Boston on June 28, 2021.[9][10] In July 2021, Ayden Mayeri, Lorenza Izzo, and Annie Mumolo joined the cast.[11] As of July 7, 2021, the film was spotted shooting scenes in Worcester.[12] The film had only a 27-day shooting schedule and Hamm and Mottola returned a portion of their salaries in order to secure an additional 3 days of filming.[13]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 126 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Shorter on wacky hijinks but still very funny, Confess, Fletch is a showcase for Jon Hamm's comedic chops that revives this long-dormant franchise with style.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[15]\n\nSequel[edit]\nShortly after the film's release, Mottola said he had been hired to write a sequel based on the 1978 novel Fletch's Fortune, but said he was \"not sure\" if it would be produced.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Ryan, Mike (September 22, 2022). \"Director Greg Mottola Hopes You've Noticed There's A New Fletch Movie Out That People Seem To Like\".
