        "In March 2019, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that a prequel to Pet Sematary (2019) was possible if the film was a success financially. The following month, directors Kevin K\u00f6lsch and Denis Widmyer ruled themselves out of returning, saying, \"If you were going to do more, you'd probably do backstory stuff. [...] I'd be really interested to see how somebody would do a sequel to this movie. It probably won't be us\".",
        "In May 2019, screenwriter Jeff Buhler stated that there had been preliminary discussions on a continuation, saying, \"So a lot of the ideas that we've been batting around currently, recently, have all been about, more about digging into the mythology of the town, these rituals that children present, the mythology of the Micmac, the Wendigo, the cemetery, the origins, Jud's life. So it looks like, I don't want to promise anything, because we don't know, we're not even down the road on an idea yet.\" The film was officially announced in February 2021, with Buhler and di Bonaventura returning as screenwriter and producer, respectively. Lindsey Beer was hired to direct in May 2021.",
        "In June 2021, Jackson White was cast as a young Jud Crandall. The following month, Pam Grier joined the cast. Principal photography took place in Montreal in August 2021, with some scenes being shot at John Abbott College."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of 58 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Pet Sematary: Bloodlines\u00a0takes half-hearted stabs at expanding the world of Stephen King's original story, but they're largely lost in a substandard story that mistakes bland gore for effective horror.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 31 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.",
        "Michael Nordine  writing for Variety said, \"Among the film's many flaws \u2014 its flat aesthetics, the forgettable characters who inhabit it (including David Duchovny and Pam Grier, both underused) \u2014 perhaps the most egregious is its utter lack of atmosphere. There's no sense of foreboding despite its attempts to unsettle, no feeling that the early warning signs are leading to anything especially frightening. Audiences already know what the eponymous burial ground does to anyone (or anything) unlucky enough to be interred there, and Bloodlines does little to live up to or expand the mythos\". Bob Strauss of the San Francisco Chronicle  wrote, \"It's a better horror movie than the 2019 remake, but like Mary Lambert's 1989 production, it still feels unnecessary. Cool as the concept of a magic graveyard that brings beloved pets and, later, not so lovely people back from the dead may be, this remains second-rate King movie material\"."
