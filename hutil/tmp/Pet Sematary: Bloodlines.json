Serving as a prequel to Pet Sematary (2019), which in turn was based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Stephen King. It is the fourth installment of the Pet Sematary film series and stars Jackson White, Forrest Goodluck, Jack Mulhern, Henry Thomas, Natalie Alyn Lind, Isabella Star LaBlanc, Samantha Mathis, Pam Grier and David Duchovny.\nSet in 1969, 50 years before the events of the previous film, the plot follows a young Jud Crandall as he discovers a local Native American cemetery where the dead can live again, without realizing the horror that will affect his life.\nAfter the commercial success of Pet Sematary in 2019, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura had plans for a prequel explaining the mythology and universe of the film. In February 2021, the film was green-lit, with Buhler and di Bonaventura returning in their roles as screenwriter and producer, respectively. Beer signed on as director in May 2021 and principal photography began in August of the same year.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 23, 2023, which was followed by its streaming launch on Paramount+ on October 6.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nIn 1969, a young Jud Crandall dreams of escaping his hometown, until he discovers the malevolent secrets of what is buried in a cemetery. He confronts a haunting family legacy that forever connects him to the place and unites with his childhood friends as they face an ancient evil that has plagued Ludlow from its inception.[2]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJackson White as Jud Crandall\nNatalie Alyn Lind as Norma\nForrest Goodluck as Manny\nIsabella Star LaBlanc as Donna\nHenry Thomas as Dan Crandall\nJack Mulhern as Timmy Baterman\nDavid Duchovny as Bill Baterman\nSamantha Mathis as Kathy Crandall\nPam Grier as Majorie Washburn\nAdditionally, Vincent Leclerc plays a priest and Ted Whittall plays a hospital visitor.\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn March 2019, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that a prequel to Pet Sematary (2019) was possible if the film was a success financially.[3] The following month, directors Kevin K\u00f6lsch and Denis Widmyer ruled themselves out of returning, saying, \"If you were going to do more, you'd probably do backstory stuff. [...] I'd be really interested to see how somebody would do a sequel to this movie. It probably won't be us\".[4]\nIn May 2019, screenwriter Jeff Buhler stated that there had been preliminary discussions on a continuation, saying, \"So a lot of the ideas that we've been batting around currently, recently, have all been about, more about digging into the mythology of the town, these rituals that children present, the mythology of the Micmac, the Wendigo, the cemetery, the origins, Jud's life. So it looks like, I don't want to promise anything, because we don't know, we're not even down the road on an idea yet.\"[5] The film was officially announced in February 2021, with Buhler and di Bonaventura returning as screenwriter and producer, respectively.[6][7] Lindsey Beer was hired to direct in May 2021.[8]\nIn June 2021, Jackson White was cast as a young Jud Crandall.[9] The following month, Pam Grier joined the cast.[10] Principal photography took place in Montreal in August 2021, with some scenes being shot at John Abbott College.[9][11]\n\nRelease[edit]\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 23, 2023.[12][13] It was released by Paramount+ on October 6, 2023, in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, and the following day in other territories.[2]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of 58 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Pet Sematary: Bloodlines\u00a0takes half-hearted stabs at expanding the world of Stephen King's original story, but they're largely lost in a substandard story that mistakes bland gore for effective horror.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 31 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[15]\nMichael Nordine  writing for Variety said, \"Among the film's many flaws \u2014 its flat aesthetics, the forgettable characters who inhabit it (including David Duchovny and Pam Grier, both underused) \u2014 perhaps the most egregious is its utter lack of atmosphere. There's no sense of foreboding despite its attempts to unsettle, no feeling that the early warning signs are leading to anything especially frightening. Audiences already know what the eponymous burial ground does to anyone (or anything) unlucky enough to be interred there, and Bloodlines does little to live up to or expand the mythos\".[16] Bob Strauss of the San Francisco Chronicle  wrote, \"It's a better horror movie than the 2019 remake, but like Mary Lambert's 1989 production, it still feels unnecessary. Cool as the concept of a magic graveyard that brings beloved pets and, later, not so lovely people back from the dead may be, this remains second-rate King movie material\".[17]\n\nPotential future[edit]\nIn September 2023, Beer stated that she would like to develop additional Pet Sematary installments to expand the franchise, which could further explore the origins of the evil in the franchise,[18] while the filmmaker expressed interest in being involved in the potential future.[19] By October of the same year, producer di Bonaventura stated that all creatives involved are considering developing a sequel, while producer Vahradian stated that future installments may further explore the demonic entity which causes the horrific events of the franchise.[20] Later that same month, Beer confirmed that there are ongoing discussions to create additional Pet Sematary films, which may further detail the history of the ancient evil in Ludlow Town.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Pet Sematary: Bloodlines (15)\".
