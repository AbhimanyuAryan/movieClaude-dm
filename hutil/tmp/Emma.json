    "Plot": [
        "In Regency-Era England, wealthy and beautiful Emma Woodhouse lives with her father at his Hartfield estate in the Surrey town of Highbury, and is often visited by Mr Knightley, a local landowner who is the brother of her sister's husband. Emma searches for a new companion after her old governess, Miss Taylor, gets married. She settles on Harriet Smith, a younger girl who Emma supposes is the unclaimed child of a gentleman; Harriet's parents are unknown, but her education has been provided for. Emma learns that Mr. Robert Martin, a tenant farmer of Mr. Knightley, has proposed marriage to Harriet. Though claiming she will not interfere, Emma manipulates Harriet into declining the proposal. Emma believes that Mr. Elton, the local vicar, is in love with Harriet and encourages her to transfer her hopes to him, despite Mr. Knightley's warning that she should not involve herself in the situation.",
        "At Christmas time, Emma's sister and Mr. Knightley's brother come to visit, with their children. After everyone leaves dinner with the Westons early, Emma finds herself alone in a carriage with Mr. Elton, who declares his love for her. Emma refuses him, and Mr. Elton disappears for six weeks, eventually returning with a wife. Two much-talked-about relations of Highbury residents appear: Jane Fairfax, the niece of Miss Bates, and Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son from his first marriage. Emma grows envious of Jane's accomplishments, but is attracted by Frank.",
        "Frank's arrival prompts the Westons to hold a ball, where Mr. Elton embarrasses Harriet by pointedly refusing to dance with her. She is rescued by Mr. Knightley, who asks her to dance. Emma and Mr. Knightley also dance together, awakening romantic feelings between them. Though Emma leaves before Mr. Knightley can speak to her, he runs to her home only for their meeting to be interrupted by Frank, who has rescued Harriet after she is set upon by traveller children. Harriet tells Emma that she has fallen in love again, leading Emma to believe Harriet is in love with Frank. Emma again vows not to interfere, but manipulates circumstances so that Harriet and Frank may spend more time together.",
        "Emma tries to spend more time with Mr. Knightley and is surprised when he repeatedly ignores her. On a picnic with their social acquaintances at Box Hill, Frank urges them to play a game to amuse Emma, who unthinkingly insults Miss Bates, leading the party to disband. Mr. Knightley rebukes Emma for her behaviour, and a humiliated Emma apologizes to Miss Bates, who accepts her apology without question.",
        "Frank Churchill's wealthy aunt dies, and he is no longer required to be at her beck and call. The Westons reveal he was secretly engaged to Jane Fairfax and waiting for his aunt, who opposed the match, to die. The Westons had hoped he would marry Emma, but Emma is only distressed on account of Harriet's supposed hopes. Emma breaks the news to Harriet, who reveals that she is actually in love with Mr. Knightley. Harriet realizes that Emma herself is in love with Mr. Knightley.",
        "Mr. Knightley goes to Emma to comfort her about the news of Frank and Jane being engaged, revealing that he is in love with Emma and hopes to marry her. Initially pleased with his marriage offer, Emma develops a nosebleed when she realizes how upset Harriet will be, and she runs off leaving behind a very confused but hopeful Mr. Knightley. She goes to Mr. Martin to make amends, offering him a portrait of Harriet she drew herself. Harriet tells that Emma she has accepted Mr. Martin's renewed offer of marriage and that her father has revealed his identity now that she is of age; he is not a gentleman, but a tradesman who makes galoshes. Emma congratulates Harriet and invites her to bring her father to Emma's home once he comes to Highbury.",
        "Though Emma and Mr. Knightley are very much in love, Emma is distressed at the thought of leaving her father alone. To accommodate her wishes, Mr. Knightley suggests that he join them at Hartfield rather than have Emma quit her father's home. Emma happily agrees, and the two are married."

    "Production": [
        "In October 2018, Anya Taylor-Joy was cast in the lead role, and Autumn de Wilde was signed for her directorial debut. In December 2018, Johnny Flynn joined the cast.",
        "In March 2019, Bill Nighy, Mia Goth, Josh O'Connor, Callum Turner, Miranda Hart, Rupert Graves, Gemma Whelan, Amber Anderson and Tanya Reynolds joined the cast, and Alexandra Byrne signed as costume designer. Principal photography began on 18 March 2019, was scheduled to conclude on 24 May, but eventually wrapped on 6 June 2019.",
        "Firle Place in Sussex was used for the exterior of Emma's home. Other locations included Lower Slaughter (exteriors) in the Cotswolds standing in for the village of Highbury, Kingston Bagpuize House in Oxfordshire, Wilton House near Salisbury in Wiltshire, and Chavenage House at Beverston, Gloucestershire.",
        "Director de Wilde decided the film's title should include a period (full stop) to signify its being a period piece.",
        "In the film, Jane Fairfax (played by Amber Anderson) outshines Emma by performing the third movement from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 12 on the fortepiano. A trained pianist, Anderson had to relearn the piece to adapt her technique to the period instrument's shorter keys.",
        "The credit sequence features \"Queen Bee\", an original song by Johnny Flynn. Isobel Waller-Bridge asked Flynn to write a song for the film. He wrote \"Queen Bee\" to convey Knightley's perspective on Emma, and performed it in a style appropriate for the film's period.",
        "The soundtrack features many a cappella recordings of folk songs by artists like Maddy Prior and the Watersons. De Wilde had an immediate conception of the film's music being rooted in folk music. She also wanted the orchestral score to emulate Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, where each character had a theme that personified them.",
        "Anya Taylor-Joy, Anderson and Flynn all sing onscreen in the film. Taylor-Joy took pains to explain that her performance of \"The Last Rose of Summer\" used an affected style that she imagined Emma Woodhouse would use to charm her audience.",
        "Anderson and Flynn sing a duet of 'Drink to me Only With Thine Eyes' written by Ben Jonson in the film during a ball scene.",
        "The adagio from the final movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 45 in F sharp minor, \"Farewell\", is also heard in the film."
