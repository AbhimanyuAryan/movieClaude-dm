It is an adaptation by Keith Bunin of Steve Almond and Julianna Baggott's novel of the same name.\nWhich Brings Me to You was released in theaters on January 19, 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nPhotographer Will and journalist Jane meet at a wedding in The Hamptons. His extreme tardiness catches her attention. Later, Will approaches Jane at the reception, they chat briefly on the nearby beach, then Jane proposes they have sex in a closet.\nOnce they are all over each other, Will decides he wants to talk first. Jane storms out and he follows, insisting she not drive drunk. He shares his basic deets and she reluctantly gives hers. Then Will tells her about his most embarrassing sexual encounter and lost first love. Although he'd promised to return at Christmas, when he tries to surprise her, he finds her cheating on him.\nIn a diner, Will then gets Jane to tell her first heartbreak story. A Catholic school student, bad boy Michael attracted her, introducing her to graffitti and petty theft. One day when he didn't collect her as usual, she found him at home as his father had died. When Jane offered emotional support, Michael broke ties.\nNext, Will suggests adventure. They trespass at a closed-down amusement park, but after goofing around, a security guard kicks them out.\nWill's next talks about Eve, a visitor to his campus. Convincing him to skip class, they have sex, then she lures him to her NYC apartment. Soon he's skipping classes and spending most of his time there. One day, when Will warns he can't come for a month due to exams, Eve declares she loves him. He then does an Irish exit.  \nJane tells him about Elton. He is a local who charms her by buying her underage self a drink in a bar. Then Elton whisks Jane away from a lit class. One evening, he shouts his feelings for her from the edge of the tallest campus building's rooftop, prompting his institutionalization. Jane visits Elton, but his deluded dream of their impending trip to Paris prompts her to cut out.\nBoth Will and Jane's parents had separated when they were young, their fathers left them. Hungry, upon finding a roadside restaurant closed for a 40 year anniversary, Will insists they crash it. When confronted, Jane is totally honest and the couple lets them stay. \nAfterwards, on the way to Will's motel, when Jane asks of any present relationships, he insists he's only had flings and been single for the past year. She, however, recently broke off an engagement. Settling for a lawyer, his younger brother could sense it, made a pass and they had sex, thus ending the engagement. \nJane's most heartbreaking relationship story happened directly before the engagement. A grad student, she got involved with a professor with agoraphobia which soon became cohabitation. After months, finally heading to a party, he backs out, but insists she go without him. Returning, Jane finds the former alcoholic drunk on the porch. In the morning, desperate to not lose her, he proposes. As Jane is doing an Irish exit, he wakes. A short time later, she visits his grave. Jane still feels responsible.\nWill starts to tell Jane about the singer Aurora. At this point, they passionately make love. As Will goes to the bathroom, Jane insists he finish telling the story. Before he can, she finds an adoring card. Will explains that it is connected to Aurora's story. They'd gotten serious and moved in together, but he soon breaks up with her. Returning his key, Aurora reveals she's pregnant. Will is indignant he hadn't been told.\nThe card is from Will's almost 5 y.o. daughter Juliet. An indignant Jane abruptly gets dressed to leave, as Will begs her, asking why. She insists he is too damaged, like everyone she's ever dated. While a distraught Will calls Juliet then jumps into the ocean, after a long walk, Jane calls a Lyft. Emotionally torn, she asks the driver to pull over. Just as she decides to go back, Will drives by, so they follow.  \nJane follows Will onto the beach where they'd met and he excitedly tells her all about Juliet, showing he adores her. They both admit that as they talked, they got increasingly more interested in each other and motivated to share. So they promise to take a leap of faith to be together. \n[2]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nLucy Hale as Jane\nNat Wolff as Will\nJohn Gallagher Jr. as Wallace\nGenevieve Angelson as Eve\nAlexander Hodge as Elton\nBritne Oldford as Audrey\nErin Ruth Walker as Jodi\nChase Liefeld as Michael\nWard Horton as Mark\nReilly Walters as Todd\nMichael Mulheren as Eddie\nMarceline Hugot as Olivia\nShannon O'Neill as a Lyft driver\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nAn adaptation of Steve Almond and Julianna Baggott's novel Which Brings Me to You by Keith Bunin was announced in May 2022 from director Peter Hutchings and BCDF Pictures.[3] The film is produced by Claude Dal Farra and Brian Keady, and was executive produced by Lucy Hale and Nat Wolff along with Decal Releasing\u2019s Sara Castillo and Ayo Kepher-Maat.
