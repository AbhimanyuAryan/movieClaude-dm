        "Joker (2019) was intended to be a standalone film with no sequels, but due to earning $1.079 billion on a budget between $55-70 million, Warner Bros. intended for it to launch DC Black, a line of DC Comics-based films unrelated to the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) franchise with darker, more experimental material, similar to the DC Black Label comics publisher. While director Todd Phillips said in August 2019 that he would be interested in making a sequel, depending on the film's performance and if Phoenix was interested, he later clarified that \"the movie's not set up to [have] a sequel. We always pitched it as one movie, and that's it.\" In October 2019, Phoenix spoke to journalist and Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers of possibly reprising the role of Arthur, centering on Travers' asking of Phoenix if he considers Joker to be his \"dream role.\" Phoenix stated, \"I can't stop thinking about it... if there's something else we can do with Joker that might be interesting,\" and concluded, \"It's nothing that I really wanted to do prior to working on this movie. I don't know that there is [more to do] ... Because it seemed endless, the possibilities of where we can go with the character.\" He was paid $20\u00a0million for his involvement.",
        "In November 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported that a sequel was in development, with Phillips, Silver, and Phoenix allegedly expected to reprise their duties. However, Deadline Hollywood reported the same day that The Hollywood Reporter's story was false and that negotiations had not even begun yet. Phillips responded to the reports by saying that he had discussed a sequel with Warner Bros. and it remained a possibility, but it was not in development. Phillips also confirmed that The Batman (2022) would not be set in the same continuity as Joker. During an interview with Variety at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Phillips expressed interest in a spin-off focusing on Batman, saying, \"It's a beautiful Gotham. What I would like to see someone tackle is what Batman looks like from that Gotham. I'm not saying I'm going to do that. What was interesting to me about the inclusion of Batman in our movie was 'What kind of Batman does that Gotham make?' That's all I meant by that.\" In June 2022, Phillips announced that the sequel was in development, with a script by him and Silver. The film was also revealed to be titled Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux. By February 2023, DC Studios CEO James Gunn confirmed that Folie \u00e0 Deux would be a DC Elseworlds project, taking place outside the main cinematic DC Universe (DCU).",
        "Days after the film's official announcement, it was announced Lady Gaga was in talks to portray Harley Quinn and that the film would be a musical. Gaga would confirm her casting later that summer. She received $12\u00a0million for her involvement. In August 2022, it was reported Zazie Beetz was in negotiations to reprise her role as Sophie Dumond in the film. Beetz was confirmed to be reprising her role the following month, alongside the cast additions of Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Jacob Lofland. Gleeson joined the project out of his admiration for both Phoenix's \"indelible\" performance in the first film and Gaga, but admitted to being \"kinda intimidated\" by what he had to do for his role. In October, Harry Lawtey joined the cast in what Deadline Hollywood reported as a \"big role\".",
        "Principal photography began on December 10, 2022, with Phillips releasing a first look on his Instagram account and Lawrence Sher serving as cinematographer. Sher had cited Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart (1982) as a source of visual inspiration for the film. Exterior filming occurred in Los Angeles and New York by March 2023. Gaga had filmed scenes with a crowd of extras demanding Joker's arrest outside the New York County Courthouse, which had led some people nearby to mistake it for the arrest of Donald Trump following his first indictment. Arkham Asylum scenes were filmed at the abandoned Essex County Isolation Hospital in New Jersey. In April 2023, filming took place at the \"Joker Stairs\", the stairway on West 167th Street in the Bronx featured prominently in the first film. Filming officially wrapped on April 5, 2023. The film is shot partially with IMAX-certified digital cameras.",
        "In December 2023, Gunn revealed he reviewed shot material and gave his notes regarding it. The film reportedly has a budget of $200\u00a0million, a large increase from Joker's budget of $60\u00a0million."
