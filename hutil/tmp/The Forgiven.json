        "Married couple David and Jo Henninger travel to Morocco in an effort to ease the strain that has been building between them. While traveling up a curve, David accidentally hits and kills a young teenager holding a fossil.",
        "After bringing the body of the deceased teenager, identified as Driss, to their friend Richard Galloway's house during a celebration, David agrees to report the death as accidental since he was driving intoxicated. The next day, David travels with Driss's father and interpreter Anouar back to Driss' home where he is buried.",
        "Meanwhile, Jo stays behind and engages in debaucheries and activities hosted by Richard. She even has an adulterous affair with one of the guests. While traveling back with Anouar, David confesses that he hid Driss' identification despite Jo's protests and admits the accident was his fault.",
        "That night, after reuniting with Jo, both she and David leave the party once most of the guests leave. Traveling past the site of Driss's death, they are confronted by his friend who is armed with a revolver. Pressured by a distressed David, the friend shoots David dead much to Jo's horror before walking off into the distance."

    "Reception": [
        "In the United States and Canada, the film earned $135,476 from 125 theaters in its opening weekend.",
        "On Rotten Tomatoes, The Forgiven has an overall approval rating of 68% with an average score of 6.2/10 based on 130 reviews, with the site's consensus being, \"The Forgiven often strays from an incisive critique of reckless privilege into a shallow display of bad behavior, although Ralph Fiennes' rakish performance packs plenty of sardonic bite.\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 59 based on 33 reviews indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "Peter Debruge from Variety said the film was \u201cundeniably wicked yet deliciously prickly... McDonagh loves his monsters.\u201d John Defore from Hollywood Reporter praised the film as \"scripted, directed and acted with intelligence and panache.\u201d Pete Hammond from Deadline also praised the film as \u201ca rare and thoroughly adult drama offering much to think about.\u201d Steve Pond of The Wrap concluded: \"There's a lot of despicable stuff going on in this efficiently nasty drama from the Irish writer-director of The Guard and Calvary, but in the hands of McDonagh, Ralph Fiennes and Jessica Chastain, you may actually find yourself caring for these people more than they care for themselves.\" Pete Howell from The Toronto Star wrote: \"A crack ensemble cast \u2014 including Matt Smith, Caleb Landry Jones and Canada's Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze \u2014 and a wickedly smart screenplay amplify moral issues that gnaw at the mind.\" Chris Bumbray from Joblo.com gave the film a 9 and predicted: \"The Forgiven will likely open John Michael McDonagh up to a larger audience than he's got so far, thanks to the dynamic star turns by Ralph Fiennes and Jessica Chastain. Thematically, it's right in line with some of his other, under-seen gems, such as The Guard, Calvary, and most recently, War on Everyone.\""
