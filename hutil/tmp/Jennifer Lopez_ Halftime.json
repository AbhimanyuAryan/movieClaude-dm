by Amanda Micheli.[1] Its story follows the career of Jennifer Lopez, with a heavy focus on her performance at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show and her film Hustlers (2019).[2] The film premiered at the opening night of the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival,[3][4][5] and was released on Netflix on June 14, 2022.[6][7]\nLopez re-recorded an orchestra version of the song entitled \"Same Girl (Halftime Remix)\" featuring French Montana along with another song, a rendition of \"This Land Is Your Land\" / \"America the Beautiful\", to coincide with the release of the film.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nJennifer

2022,[4] and on Netflix on June 14, 2022.[6]\nThe film debuted at #2 worldwide on Netflix on its second day of streaming, behind Hustle starring Adam Sandler.\nBetween June 12, 2022, and June 26, 2022, the documentary was watched for 27.25 million hours on Netflix.[8]\n\nReception[edit]\nOverall, the documentary has garnered positive reviews from film critics and the general public alike.[9][10][11][12] The film has a 84% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews.[13] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it \"a solid, entertaining, insider's look at the life and times of a once-aspiring singer-dancer-actress from the Bronx who left home at 18 to pursue her dreams, got her first big break as a 'Fly Girl' on In Living Color, and for the last three decades has starred in some 40 major motion pictures and has sold more than 75 million records worldwide.\"[14] Adam Green of The Detroit News called it \"an inspirational look at someone who has overcome the odds and continues to fight to be taken seriously and to have her voice be heard.\"[15] Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and concluded that it \"is unlikely to majorly shift anyone's thoughts on Jennifer Lopez.\"[16]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of
