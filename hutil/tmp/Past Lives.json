    "Plot": [
        "In 2000, Seoul, South Korea, Na Young and Hae Sung are 12-year-old classmates who develop feelings for one another and go on a date set up by their parents. Shortly thereafter, Na Young's family immigrates to Toronto and the two lose contact. Na Young changes her name to Nora Moon.",
        "Twelve years later, in 2012, Hae Sung has finished his military service and Nora has moved to New York City. One day, Nora discovers on Facebook that Hae Sung had posted that he was looking for Na Young, unaware of her name change. They reconnect through video calls but are unable to visit each other, as Nora plans to attend a writer's retreat in Montauk and Hae Sung is moving to China for a Mandarin language exchange. Eventually, Nora tells Hae Sung they should stop talking for a while, as she wants to focus on her writing and life in New York. At her retreat, Nora meets Arthur Zaturansky and they fall in love. Hae Sung also meets a woman, whom he begins to date.",
        "Twelve more years pass, with Arthur and Nora married and living in New York. Hae Sung, no longer with his girlfriend, goes to meet Nora there. Arthur wonders if he is a roadblock in their own imperfect love story, admitting to Nora that he harbored suspicions that Nora married him to secure a green card for U.S. residency. Nora affirms that she loves Arthur. The following night, the three go out to dinner. Initially, Nora translates each dialogue, but eventually speaks with Hae Sung exclusively in Korean. He wonders what they were to each other in their past lives, and what would have happened if she had never left South Korea and they stayed together. When Nora goes to the bathroom, Hae Sung apologizes to Arthur for speaking alone with Nora, but Arthur says he is glad to have met him.",
        "They return to Arthur and Nora's apartment. Hae Sung invites them to visit him in South Korea and calls for an Uber. Nora waits with him, and the two exchange long, meaningful looks at each other until the Uber arrives. Hae Sung wonders whether they were, at that moment, experiencing a past life, and asks Nora what their relationship will be in their next life. She says she does not know. Hae Sung says, \"I'll see you then.\" He leaves in the car and she walks back to her apartment, crying in Arthur's arms."

    "Reception": [
        "Past Lives grossed $11.2\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $27.4\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $38.6\u00a0million.",
        "The film grossed $232,266 from four theaters in its opening weekend, an average of $55,066 per venue. By its sixth weekend, the film had a running total of $8.4 million.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 300 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.0/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A remarkable debut for writer-director Celine Song, Past Lives uses the bonds between its sensitively sketched central characters to support trenchant observations on the human condition.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".",
        "Manola Darghis writing for The New York Times compared the film to French romantic cinema complimenting its restraint in the presentation of its main themes stating: \"The movie\u2019s modesty \u2014 its intimacy, human scale, humble locations and lack of visual oomph \u2014 is one of its strengths. The characters live in homes that are pleasant yet ordinary, the kind that you can imagine hanging out in, the kind you want to hang out in. There are few big, look-at-me details, though you might notice a poster for Jacques Rivette\u2019s 1974 classic C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating in Nora\u2019s father\u2019s home office in Seoul.\" Writing in The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw was fulsome in his praise of the film comparing it to those of Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach, and Greta Gerwig. He said of the film: \"Past Lives is a glorious date movie, and a movie for every occasion, too. As ever with films like this, there is an auxiliary pleasure\u00a0in wondering how much of her own past life Song has used. It's a must-see.\"",
        "Filmmaker Daniel Scheinert, who co-directed A24's Everything Everywhere All at Once with his partner Daniel Kwan, praised the film, saying \"It's remarkable, the way she [Celine Song] pushed past the story of \"picking mister right\" and the story of \"fighting to win the girl\" and somehow brought her audience to this painfully relatable heartbreak on the other side of those stories. I'm inspired by it. And mystified by how the filmmaking team did it. But when I was lucky enough to see a Q&A and have some brunch with Celine, I saw how curious and thoughtful and passionate and charmingly bossy she was, and I was instantly convinced that this movie was no accident. It's a smart, confident, unique poem because Celine is a smart, confident, unique poet.\" Filmmaker Christopher Nolan also praised the film and named it one of his favorites, describing it as \"subtle in a beautiful sort of way.\"",
        "Collider ranked it number 7 on its list of the \"20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" calling it \"a story that could only exist because of modern circumstances, but feels timeless in its approach. How does someone choose between two lovers, one that represents the most fruitful days of her youth, and the other someone she has grown to love as part of her reality? Celine Song examines these critical conversations through the perspective of an immigrant story.\"",
        "In 2024, IndieWire included it on its list of the \"Best American Independent Movies of the 21st Century.\""
