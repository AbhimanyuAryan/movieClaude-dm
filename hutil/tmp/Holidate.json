It stars Emma Roberts, Luke Bracey, Jake Manley, Jessica Capshaw, Andrew Bachelor, Frances Fisher, Manish Dayal and Kristin Chenoweth. The film was released on Netflix on October 28, 2020.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAlmost 30-something Sloane Benson hates the holidays due to the judgement she receives from her family for being single. Having recently broken up with her boyfriend, her mother Elaine is constantly trying to set her up with a new man, much to Sloane's annoyance.\nAt Sloane's family's Christmas dinner, her younger brother York gets engaged to Liz, his girlfriend of three months, so Sloane is now the only single person left in the family. Meanwhile, Jackson, an Australian golfer, is stuck spending the holidays with a woman he has no interest in and her parents. His date becomes angry with him for not getting her a Christmas present although they'd agreed not to exchange gifts, so he leaves in frustration.\nAfter Christmas, Sloane and Jackson have a chance encounter when both are returning presents they received. Jackson suggests to avoid crazy and clingy dates, they should make a pact to be Holidates (dates only for Holidays). Though initially reluctant, she decides to take him up on his offer and they end up spending New Year's Eve together, but have no further contact.\nHowever, on Valentine's Day, both have another chance encounter where Jackson pretends to be her boyfriend in front of her ex and his young and beautiful girlfriend. They slowly become friends after spending various holidays together.\nAfter Sloane and Jackson become closer when he loses a finger on July 4th, he fears he is not good enough for her. So, he tries to set her up with a better date. This leads to a fight at her brother's wedding, where his and her dates hook up.\nWhile at a Halloween costume party together, Sloane becomes unwell after unknowingly swallowing laxatives. Jackson takes care of her until they end up falling asleep together. They then have sex the morning after, then Sloane's married sister arrives freaking out about kissing somebody else. Sloane uses it as an excuse to shove Jackson out, much to his dismay.\nAt Thanksgiving, they fight after Jackson opens up to Sloane and tells her how he feels about them. In the store when Sloane says \"Ryan Gosling would never do his own shopping\" there is a blurred customer in the background who looks like the actor. Both break off contact afterwards.\nIn the days leading to Christmas, Sloane visits Jackson's place but loses her nerve, still unable to speak to him. When shopping at the mall, they have another chance encounter. In front of hundreds of people, she finally confesses her love for Jackson and the two embrace.\nThe end credits reveal that all of the couples are still together. With Sloane and Jackson travelling to Australia for the holidays, Aunt Susan being engaged to Farooq, Wally and Sloane's mother dating, just like Neil and Carly (Jackson's date from the beginning of the film).\n\nCast[edit]\n\nEmma Roberts as Sloane Benson\nLuke Bracey as Jackson\nAndrew Bachelor as Neil\nJessica Capshaw as Abby\nManish Dayal as Faarooq\nAlex Moffat as Peter\nJake Manley as York\nCynthy Wu as Liz\nFrances Fisher as Elaine\nKristin Chenoweth as Aunt Susan\nDan Lauria as Wally\nCarl McDowell as Scruffy Santa\nNicola Peltz as Felicity\nJulien Marlon as Luc\nMikaela Hoover as Annie\nAimee Carrero as Carly\nMeeghan Holaway as Carly's Mom\nSavannah Reina as Daisy\nBilly Slaughter as Barry\nCarlos Lacamara as Carly's Dad\nProduction[edit]\nIn March 2019, it was announced Emma Roberts had joined the cast of the film, with John Whitesell directing from a screenplay by Tiffany Paulsen.
