The film stars Paul Bettany and Sophia Lillis. Set in the 1970s, Uncle Frank is a road movie about a gay man who confronts his past.[1]\nIt had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020. It was released on November 25, 2020, by Amazon Studios.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1973, 18-year-old Beth Bledsoe moves from her home in Creekville, South Carolina, to attend college in New York City. Her uncle Frank Bledsoe is a college professor there and is the relative she feels closest to as he is more refined and thoughtful than the rest of the family.\nBeth meets a boyfriend, Bruce, and shows up with him unannounced to a party at Frank's apartment. Through events that happen at the party, she discovers that Frank is secretly gay and has been living with a man named Walid (\"Wally\") for over ten years. Frank rejects the sexual advance on Bruce's part, caring for Beth when she gets too drunk. He pleads with her not to tell anyone else in the family his secret, and she agrees.\nThe next day, Beth's grandfather and Frank's father, Daddy Mac, dies of a sudden heart attack. Frank agrees to drive Beth back to South Carolina for the funeral. Wally asks to come along and meet Frank's family, but Frank refuses, not yet ready to reveal the truth to them. However, Wally rents a car and follows them most of the way there; when Frank catches him, he agrees to let him come but stay in a motel during the funeral, fearful of what the locals might do if they discover their true relationship.\nAlong their journey, Frank has flashbacks to his teenage years and a sexual relationship he had with another boy named Samuel; his father caught them in bed together and called Frank an abomination against God. To cope with these memories, Frank begins secretly drinking; he asks Beth not to tell Wally as Frank is a recovering alcoholic.\nBeth and Frank arrive home to attend the funeral. At the reading of the will, Frank learns he has been cut out of his inheritance, and the will bitterly exposes Frank's homosexuality to the family. An emotional Frank flees, driving away erratically while drinking heavily. A panicked Beth rushes to inform Wally, who drives them to the nearby lake where he suspects Frank went. A final flashback reveals that Frank told Samuel they could not be together as it displeased God, and Samuel drowned himself in the lake shortly after. Wally and Beth discover Frank's clothes sitting on a dock by the water, but Frank is nowhere to be seen.\nWally and Beth return to the motel, where Wally grieves for Frank's supposed death. However, a drunken Frank returns, claiming he just went for a swim. An argument ensues as Wally confronts Frank for his drinking; Frank punches Wally and calls him a faggot before fleeing again. They later reconcile at Samuel's grave as Frank expresses guilt for his death. Frank laments that he has no family left; Wally reassures him that he is Frank's family. After an impassioned speech from Beth, Frank agrees to let Wally meet his family. While Frank's brother-in-law is unable to morally accept the truth, his siblings and mother have no problem with the secret and warmly welcome Wally.\n\nCast[edit]\nPaul Bettany as Frank Bledsoe\nCole Doman as young Frank Bledsoe\nSophia Lillis as Elizabeth Bledsoe\nPeter Macdissi as Walid \"Wally\" Nadeem\nSteve Zahn as Mike Bledsoe\nJudy Greer as Kitty Bledsoe\nMargo Martindale as Mammaw Bledsoe\nStephen Root as Daddy Mac\nLois Smith as Aunt Butch\nJane McNeill as Neva\nBurgess Jenkins as Beau\nColton Ryan as Bruce\nCaity Brewer as Marsha\nMichael Perez as Sam Lassiter\nZach Strum as Tee Dub\nRelease[edit]\nIt had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020.[2][3][4][5] Shortly after, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film.[6] It was released on November 25, 2020.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 77% rating based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10.
