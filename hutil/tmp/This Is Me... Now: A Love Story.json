    "Plot": [
        "Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's opinions on love and romance. She reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. With the help of factory workers, she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail (\"Hearts and Flowers\").",
        "Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist. He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife. The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra; she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being (\"Rebound\"). She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs, questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions. Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces, a Virgo, and a Cancer, respectively (\"Can't Get Enough\").",
        "The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance. While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices. In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story (\"Broken Like Me\").",
        "Artist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window. As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike, a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her. During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored (\"This Is Me... Now\"). With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love (\"Midnight Trip to Vegas\", \"Hummingbird\")."

    "Background and production": [
        "According to Lopez, the film has a humorous tone, saying \"not that this [A Love Story] is anything close to a romantic comedy, but those moments for me are the ones in life that show you how important it is to be able to laugh at yourself. You have to, because it's absurd sometimes the things that you find yourself in or that you go through. You think, \"I never thought I would be this person.\" According to Nuyorican Productions, the film went overbudget and this was challenging to Lopez self-financing the project. A number of celebrities were approached to star in the film; Khloe Kardashian turned it down.",
        "According to Lopez, early in the album's production, a $30 million deal for the project was pulled. As told by Benny Medina in the accompanying documentary, an \"on paper\" deal was pulled, with Medina relaying what was told to him: \"they were blown away by [Lopez]; uh, you know, the dynamic in the room; [they] thought that there was too much that was being bitten off, uh, the quality was gonna be potentially compromised.\" Lopez debated just filming a single video and before ultimately deciding to do the full visual companion (This Is Me Now... A Love Story); in the end, the project was self-financed. Lopez's production partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas thought she was crazy to self-finance the project but understood the importance of the story to both Lopez and the album. The script was written by Lopez's husband, actor Ben Affleck, Matt Walton, Dave Meyers (who also directed it) and Chris Shafer. According to Lopez, once the album was complete it felt special and \"like a moment\" so \"throwing a video out\" did not feel right. She called Meyers to play him and sing him some of the music. She said \"I told him that I made this album 20 years ago, and now we're here\". Meyers reported to want to tell the story of Affleck and Lopez's rekindled romance but instead Lopez wanted a story based on their love but not a biographical mirror of her lovelife.",
        "Contrary to many media reports, This Is Me.. Now: A Love Story is not about Lopez's relationship with Affleck. The album and the film are about Lopez learning to love herself."

    "Release and promotion": [
        "Affleck features in some of the scenes. A teaser for the project was unveiled, featuring a snippet of the album's title track. The official trailer was released on January 17, 2024. Commenting on the trailer, Tim Jonze from the Guardian remarked that Lopez's approach to a film accompanying her album differed from her peers Taylor Swift (The Eras Tour) and Beyonc\u00e9 (Renaissance), both of which were concert films. Instead, Jonze posed that Lopez was instead inventing a new genre of music films, the \"therapy-musical biopic\", noting that Lopez's approach comes from a different place as her career had revolved around music and films from the start; it was also noted that although Affleck stars in the film, Lopez \"plays a strange version of herself\" suggesting that the film's protagonist is based somewhat on Lopez's life. This was confirmed during an interview with the AU Review, where the film was described as semi-biographical and \"stylized and fictionalized\".",
        "Upon release, the film reached the number one spot on Amazon Prime Video in numerous countries such as the United States, Belize, Cambodia, Georgia, Jordan, Latvia and Tanzania. It appeared in the Top 10 list in over 30 countries."
