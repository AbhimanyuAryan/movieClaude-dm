The site's consensus reads, \"It isn't an easy watch, but Benediction uncovers a profoundly affecting drama in the real-life story of a combat veteran whose poetry warned against the horrors of war.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100 based on 32 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[20] The IndieWire Critics Poll of 165 critics named it the 13th best film released in 2022.[21]\nIn response to the film's portrayal of Sassoon's conversion to Catholicism, the poet's niece, Sister Jessica Gatty (who attributes her own conversion to Sassoon's influence), repudiated the filmmakers by revealing that he had been both at peace and joyful in his later years, stating: \"The redemption which he sought in many different ways and which he longed for, was found in the last decade of his life when he came home to Christ in the Catholic Church. He was transformed. I can witness to this, so I need to speak out.\"[22][23]\n\nSee also[edit]\nRegeneration (novel)\u00a0\u2013 1991 historical novel by Pat Barker\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Pearce, Leonard (23 June 2021). \"First TIFF 2021 Selections Include Dune, Benediction, Last Night in Soho & More\".
