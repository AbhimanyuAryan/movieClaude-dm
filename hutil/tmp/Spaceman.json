        "Czech astronaut Jakub Proch\u00e1zka is six months into a space mission to investigate a mysterious cloud of dust and particles, called Chopra, lying beyond Jupiter. The Czech mission has arrived shortly before a competing South Korean mission. Jakub struggles with loneliness and misses his wife, Lenka, who has recently stopped talking with him after he left her and their unborn daughter behind to go on the mission.",
        "Lenka sends him a message telling him that she wants to leave him, but Commissioner Tuma, Jakub's commanding officer, prevents it from reaching him, to prevent Jakub's mental state from worsening. Days later, still without news from Lenka, Jakub finds a spider-like creature with telepathic abilities inside a compartment of the ship. The creature, whom Jakub names Hanu\u0161, wishes to understand humans better and to help Jakub with his loneliness.",
        "Exploring his memories, Hanu\u0161 learns more about Jakub: his father was an informant of the state party and was killed when Jakub was young. He met Lenka, but often neglected her, being more focused on his career as a cosmonaut, going as far as leaving her when she suffered a miscarriage. After showing Jakub an implanted memory of the miscarriage, which Jakub was not present for, Hanu\u0161, disappointed with humanity, leaves the ship, leaving Jakub distressed.",
        "Jakub arranges with technician and good friend of his, Peter, to get him to deliver a message to Lenka, asking for forgiveness for his neglect. Hanu\u0161 returns after this, revealing that he's dying due to a parasitic infection that wiped out his entire species.",
        "The two finally arrive at the Chopra cloud, which is revealed to be a leftover of the beginning of the universe and where every moment of time exists simultaneously. Hanu\u0161 leaves to die in space, but Jakub goes after him. Within the cloud, Jakub comes to the conclusion that he only wishes to be with his wife. Hanu\u0161 passes away due to the infection.",
        "Jakub is picked up by the South Korean space vessel. Jakub and Lenka talk again, coming to terms with their relationship."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 50% of 130 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Spaceman's poignant themes are partly brought to life by sensitive performances from a talented cast, but it fails to consistently engage with its most interesting ideas.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "In a positive review for RogerEbert.com, Robert Daniels praised Sandler's performance, writing, \"I just love Sandler in this register. It\u2019s no longer a surprise when he pulls a well-defined and memorable dramatic performance.\" In a mixed review for IGN, Siddhant Adlakha wrote: Its visual artistry\u2014which goes to great lengths to establish mood, and uneasy emotional equilibrium\u2014is swiftly laid low by its dependence on the literal, nullifying whatever abstractions its sci-fi premise might come to briefly represent. Tim Robey of The Telegraph awarded the movie three stars out of five, summarising his review, \"We're missing any real sense of awe \u2013 but for all its faults, this lands somewhere between noble failure and endearing oddity\". Wendy Ide of The Guardian awarded the movie two stars out of five, writing that \"Spaceman is a fascinatingly odd premise let down by its drab, dispiritingly inert execution.\" Writing for The New York Times, Alissa Wilkinson negatively compared it to Argylle and Madame Web calling it \"an awful movie, a very bad movie indeed\" and saying that her favorite part was \"imagining how many people are going to click on it when it pops up on their Netflix page and wonder whether that doorjamb they\u2019d accidentally knocked into yesterday had in fact given them a concussion.\""
