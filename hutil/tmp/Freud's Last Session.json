It is based on the stage play of the same name by Mark St. Germain, which itself is based upon the book The Question of God, by Armand Nicholi. The film was directed by Matthew Brown and written by St. Germain.\nFreud's Last Session premiered at the 2023 AFI Fest on October 27, 2023. Sony Pictures Classics released the film in the United States on 22 December 2023 to mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nA fictional meeting occurs between C. S. Lewis, nicknamed \"Jack\", and Sigmund Freud, two days after the start of World War II. A debate on the existence of God, as Freud greatly resents Lewis' recent rejection of his own strain of atheism in favour of Christianity, and many other subjects follows. The two men discuss issues such as Lewis' trauma as a World War I combat veteran, J.R.R. Tolkien and the Inklings, and the nature of Freud's and Lewis' relationships with other people, such as Freud's daughter Anna, who is pathologically dependent upon her father. However, she eventually introduces her lesbian partner, Dorothy Burlingham, to him. \nFreud dies by suicide several weeks later due to the intense pain from his oral cancer. C.S. Lewis goes on to become a famous author of Christian literature, and the children he later takes in as evacuees during the war serve as inspiration for his Narnia series. Anna and Dorothy live together for decades, and Anna becomes known as the founder of child psychology. The film notes that Freud met with an unidentified Oxford don in the last days of his life, who could possibly have been Lewis.[4]\n\nCast[edit]\nAnthony Hopkins as Sigmund Freud\nMatthew Goode as C. S. Lewis\nLiv Lisa Fries as Anna Freud\nJodi Balfour as Dorothy Burlingham\nJeremy Northam as Ernest Jones\nOrla Brady as Janie Moore\nProduction[edit]\nWestEnd Films and CAA Media Finance took the project for sales to the Cannes Film Festival in May 2022 with Anthony Hopkins cast, and Matthew Brown on board as director for the St. Germain adaptation.[5] The film is produced by Alan Greisman, Rick Nicita, Meg Thomson and Hannah Leader, with production beginning in the U.K. in late January 2023.[6] However, for financial reasons Freud\u2019s Hampstead house and famous psychoanalyst couch were recreated in Dublin at the Ardmore Studios.[7] A selection of props from the film (particularly the replica couch and garden tent chair) have since May 2023 been housed at the Freud Museum London. Co-produced by Aiofe O\u2019Sullivan and Tristan Orpen Lynch of Subotica Operations, the film received UK Global Screen Fund International Co-production funding.[8][9] An image from principal photography was released in April 2023 with the film entering the final stages of filming in Ireland.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nFreud's Last Session premiered at the 2023 AFI Fest on October 27, 2023.[11] That same month, Sony Pictures Classics purchased the distribution rights for North America, Middle East, India, Eastern Europe (excluding Russia), and Turkey.[12]  It had a limited release in the United States on 22 December 2023.[13]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 44% of 86 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Anthony Hopkins and Matthew Goode are a tremendously talented pair, but Freud's Last Session is too scattered and thinly written to take full advantage of their efforts.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"All Future Releases\".
