        "In November 2020, Paramount Pictures announced a spin-off film set within the same world as A Quiet Place (2018), with Jeff Nichols set to write and direct, based on an original story by John Krasinski. Krasinski will also serve as producer alongside Michael Bay, Andrew Form, and Brad Fuller. The film is a co-production between Paramount Pictures, Sunday Night Productions, and Platinum Dunes. In May 2021, Krasinski announced that the script was complete and submitted to the studio. By October of the same year however, Nichols dropped out of the film due to creative differences while the studio was reported to be quickly looking for a replacement. In January 2022, Michael Sarnoski was announced to replace Nichols as writer and director.",
