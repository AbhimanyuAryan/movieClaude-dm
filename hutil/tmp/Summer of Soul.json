It had a limited theatrical release in the U.S. by Searchlight Pictures on June 25, 2021, before expanding and being released for streaming on Hulu the next weekend.\nThe second half of the movie's title is taken from the 1970 poem and song \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\", written by the late  Gil Scott-Heron. It offered a  sharp and satirical critique of the media's lack of coverage of civil rights activism and the reality of change and revolution taking place in the streets and on campuses across America. Both the song and phrase became an anthem of political change during the 1960s.[citation needed]\nThe film received acclaim from critics, with particular praise given to the restoration of the footage used. It won numerous awards, including Best Documentary Feature at the 6th Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, where it won in all six categories in which it was nominated, Best Documentary at the 75th British Academy Film Awards, Best Documentary Feature at the 94th Academy Awards,[7][8] and Best Music Film at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. It has been considered one of the best films of the 2020s and of the 21st century.[9][10]\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nThe film examines the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which took place on six Sundays between June 29 and August 24 at Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) in Harlem, using professional footage of the festival that was filmed as it happened, stock news footage, and modern-day interviews with attendees, musicians, and other commentators to provide historical background and social context. Despite its large attendance and performers such as Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson, Nina Simone, the 5th Dimension, the Staple Singers, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Mavis Staples, Blinky Williams, Sly and the Family Stone, and the Chambers Brothers, the festival is much less well-known in the 21st century than is Woodstock (which took place on the same weekend as one of the days of the Harlem Cultural Festival), and the filmmakers investigate this, among other topics.\n\nProduction[edit]\nClapperboard from original videotape recordings of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival\nAt the request of festival organizer and host Tony Lawrence, television producer Hal Tulchin recorded about 40 hours of footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival on videotape,[11] excerpts from which were packaged as two one-hour TV specials that were broadcast in 1969, one on CBS in July, and one on ABC in September.[12] The tapes were then placed in a basement,[13] where they sat for the next 50 years.[14] Tulchin attempted to interest broadcasters in the recordings for several years, but had little success, though some of the footage of Nina Simone was eventually used in documentaries about her.[15]\nIn 2004, Joe Lauro, a film archivist at the Historic Films Archive, discovered the existence of the footage and contacted Hal Tulchin, hoping to work on a film about the festival. He digitized and cataloged the footage[16] and, in 2006, entered into a deal with Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville to make the film,[11] but the project never saw the light of day, as Tulchin discontinued his agreement with Lauro.[16] Producer Robert Fyvolent, who had originally sought to work with Lauro, then acquired film and television rights to the footage from Tulchin.[17][18] Fyvolent began collaborating with producer David Dinerstein in 2016, and together they engaged RadicalMedia and editor Josh Pearson, and added a third producer, Joseph Patel.[19]\nDirector Ahmir Thompson has expressed surprise that the footage sat for so long, and that he had never heard of the festival before the producers approached him about making the film.[20] Discussing its obscurity, he said: \"What would have happened if this was allowed a seat at the table? How much of a difference would that have made in my life? That was the moment that extinguished any doubt I had that I could do this.\"[21]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered on January 28, 2021, at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award in the US Documentary Competition.[22] It was acquired by Searchlight Pictures and Hulu, and was released in the United States at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles and the AMC Magic Johnson Harlem 9 multiplex in New York City on June 25, 2021, before expanding nationwide and being released for streaming on Hulu the next weekend.[23] The film was set to be distributed internationally in theaters and on Disney+ Hotstar on July 30, 2021, and on Disney+ and Star+ on November 19, 2021,[24][25] and was made available on the U.S. version of Disney+ on February 8, 2022, in time for Black History Month.[26] It made its broadcast television premiere on ABC on February 20, 2022.[27] On February 8, 2022, 20th Century Studios released a hard copy on Standard Definition DVD. In a bonus feature interview, Thompson mused about expanding the film with the wealth of material he had to cut for time.\nOn April 22, 2021, it was announced that Thompson would introduce the first trailer for the film during the 93rd Academy Awards, for which he served as music director. The trailer debuted on April 25, 2021.[28]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nSummer of Soul grossed $2.3 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $1.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $3.7 million.[1]\nIn the film's first weekend in wide release, it grossed $650,000 from 752 theaters (for a per-venue average of $865).[29]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 99% (based on 220 reviews), with an average rating of 9.1/10; the website's critics consensus reads: \"Deftly interweaving incredible live footage with a series of revealing interviews, Summer of Soul captures the spirit and context of a watershed moment while tying it firmly to the present.\"[30] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 96 out of 100 (based on 38 critics), indicating \"universal acclaim\".[31] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" average grade.[29]\nRolling Stone praised the film as \"the Perfect Movie to Kick Off Sundance 2021\" and said it was \"an incredible, vital act of restoration\u2014and reclamation\".[32] The Guardian gave it five stars, writing that there is \"a moment so striking and rich with power at the center of Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson's Summer of Soul (\u2026Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised) that, while watching it, I actually forgot to breathe.\"[33]\nBritish critic Mark Kermode called the film \"the best music documentary I've ever seen\" in his review for Kermode and Mayo's Film Review on BBC Radio 5 Live.[34]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nSundance Film Festival\n\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\nGrand Jury Prize \u2013 Documentary\n\nSummer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)\n\nWon\n\n[14]\n\n\nAudience Awards \u2013 Documentary\n\nWon\n\n\nCritics' Choice Documentary Awards\n\nNovember 14, 2021\n\nBest Documentary Feature\n\nWon\n\n[35]\n\n\nBest Archival Documentary\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Music Documentary\n\nWon\n\n\nBest First Documentary Feature\n\nAhmir \"Questlove\" Thompson\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Director\n\nAhmir \"Questlove\" Thompson (tied with Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin for The Rescue)\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Editing\n\nJoshua L.
