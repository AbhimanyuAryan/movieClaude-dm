        "The Karate Kid (1984), starring Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso, was followed by three sequels: The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989) and The Next Karate Kid (1994), although Macchio did not return for the fourth film. A remake of the first film was released in 2010, with a similar storyline but with a different set of characters, including Jackie Chan as Mr. Han. Despite maintaining the original title, the remake focused on kung fu, as the film was set in China. A television series, Cobra Kai, premiered at YouTube Red (before passing one year later to Netflix) in 2018, serving as a sequel to the original four films which comprise the \"Miyagi-verse\" (named after the character Mr. Miyagi) and reuniting several actors from the first three films, including Macchio.",
        "A sequel to the 2010 remake was announced shortly after its release with Jaden Smith, Taraji P. Henson, and Jackie Chan set to reprise their roles. Breck Eisner was tapped to direct in April 2014. By then, two drafts of the screenplay had been written by writing duo Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris as well as Zak Penn. Eisner left the project three months later and a new screenplay by Jeremiah Friedman and Nick Palmer was commissioned. In April 2017, Eisner returned to the project but by October, Chan expressed dissatisaction with the film's script.",
        "In September 2022, a new feature film was confirmed to be in development, being described as \"the return of the original Karate Kid franchise\". Shortly after, Cobra Kai co-creator Jon Hurwitz stated the film was not connected to the series, despite the creators' intention to make films for the franchise in the future. In November 2023, it was reported that Jonathan Entwistle was set to direct the film, with a screenplay written by Rob Lieber and with Karen Rosenfelt serving as the producer.",
        "In August 2023, Chan was reported to be reprising his role in the film. Later on in late November 2023, Chan and Macchio were officially revealed to have joined the cast. The announcement confirms that the original films and the remake take place in the same universe, despite Hurwitz's 2021 statement that the 2010 remake is a film in-universe within the \"Miyagi-verse\". In addition, Chan and Macchio announced a world-wide open casting call for an actor to star as the film's iteration of the titular character, described as a Chinese teen who moves to the East Coast and begins studying martial arts.",
        "In February 2024, Ben Wang was cast as the titular character, Li Fong. In March, Joshua Jackson, Sadie Stanley, and Ming-Na Wen were cast in undisclosed roles. In April, Aramis Knight and Wyatt Oleff joined the cast.",
        "Principal photography began in Montreal on April 1, 2024, and is expected to last until June 3, under the working title Victory Boulevard."
