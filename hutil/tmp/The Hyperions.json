He gave three Badges to three down-on-their-luck children, creating America's most famous family of superheroes, which included telepath Vista,\u00a0super-strong Ansel, and teleporter Maya.  \nBut over the years, as egos bruised and resentments developed, the professor replaced the team with newer members. In 1979, Vista and Ansel want their powers restored and they\u2019ll stop at almost nothing to get them back. Their plan: stage a heist of their Titan Badges from The Hyperion Museum. \nBut the robbery runs into trouble when they realize that access to the badges requires Professor Mandulbaum\u2019s biometric scan. So Vista and Ansel instead take the museum staff and visitors hostage, forcing a confrontation with their former father figure, the police, and, ultimately, against a supervillain, Ares, who threatens to destroy them all. \n\nCast[edit]\nCary Elwes as Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum\nPenelope Mitchell as Vista Mandulbaum\nTanner Buchanan as Apollo\nElaine Tan as Maya\nAlphonso McAuley as Ansel\nKeli Price as Ares\nIndi Star as Young Vista\nProduction[edit]\nIn December 2018, it was announced that Elwes was cast in the film.[1]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn June 2021, it was announced that Saban Films acquired North American distribution rights to the film.[2]  In February 2022, it was announced that The Daily Wire acquired the domestic rights to the film from Saban Films.[3]  The Daily Wire released the film on YouTube on March 10, 2022.[4][5]\n\nReception[edit]\nRichard Propes of The Independent Critic gave the film 3.5 stars and called it a \"retro-styled superhero flick with a campily beating heart\" and \"an imperfect yet sublimely inspired\" film \"that weaves together past and present, family and fantasy all into a motion picture that made me smile from beginning to end.\"[6]\nAlan Ng of Film Threat rated the film a 7.5 out of 10 and wrote that \"the story of a family of Superheroes is excellent.\" He continued, \"Add Professor Mandulbaum as a father, who should never be a father, and the exploration of power granted and taken away absolutely works.\"  But he noted that the film's \"overall energy\" was \"low,\" which he thought was a \"a creative choice\" by the director.  \"In the end,\" Ng wrote, \"The Hyperions is good, not great\u2026 worse, as it has the potential to be great.\"[7]\nMatthew Pejkovic of Matt's Movie Reviews gave the film 3 stars and called it \"a surprisingly tender exploration of family and abandonment that embraces the quirky campiness of its 1970s kitsch setting\" with \"[d]ry, absurdist humour that is reminiscent of the films of Wes Anderson and Jared Hess.\" He wrote that \"[a]lthough its style is retro, its themes remain poignantly relevant.\" However, he noted that some of the performances were lacking.[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Vlessing, Etan (December 7, 2018). \"Cary Elwes Joins Superhero Drama 'The Hyperions'\".
