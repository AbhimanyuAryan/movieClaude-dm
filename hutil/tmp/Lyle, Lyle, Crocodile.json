    "Plot": [
        "In New York City, a charismatic magician named Hector P. Valenti wants to try out on a national talent show but is constantly rejected. One day after a failed audition, he wanders into an exotic pet store, where he finds a singing baby crocodile and names him Lyle. Seeing Lyle as an opportunity to become rich in the talent business, he places his three-story Victorian brownstone house as collateral for their performance, but Lyle experiences stage fright during the premiere and Hector loses the house. Hector is forced to move out and reluctantly leaves Lyle to fend for himself while he tries to make more money.",
        "Eighteen months later, Joseph and Katie Primm and their young son Josh move into the house. Josh is initially terrified of moving into his new home and struggles to make friends at school. One night, he discovers Lyle, now fully grown, living in the attic, and they become friends when Lyle saves Josh from a mugger and demonstrates his singing talent. Katie and Joseph eventually find out about Lyle, and though initially terrified of him, bond with Lyle over their favorite hobbies. One day, Hector returns to the house to visit Lyle, as an agreement states he can live in the house fifteen days a year. He makes another attempt to get Lyle to perform on stage, but it fails as Lyle still has stage fright, apart from when performing for the Primms.",
        "Meanwhile, Alistair Grumps, the Primms' unfriendly downstairs neighbor, becomes annoyed by the loud activity caused by Lyle, Hector, and the Primms. Determined to put an end to it, he has cameras installed to discover what is happening but manages to achieve his goal by bribing Hector to sell Lyle to pay his debts. Lyle cannot convince the authorities of his benevolent nature because of his stage fright and is locked up at the New York City Zoo. Feeling guilty for what he did to Lyle, Hector goes to break him out of the zoo with Josh's help, who was initially unwilling to help after learning Hector sold Lyle. On Josh's insistence, Hector and Lyle reconcile with each other before Lyle escapes with Josh to the talent show, while Hector distracts the authorities. On stage, Lyle manages to overcome his stage fright with help from Josh, receiving acclaim from the audience and viewers for his singing talent.",
        "One month later, a trial is held to determine whether or not Lyle may be free. The judge ultimately decides to rule against Grumps in favor of Lyle when Hector presents the deed to his house. The deed was written by Hector's grandmother, who built the house and founded the zoo, allowing her to keep any exotic animal in the house. After the trial, the Primms celebrate Lyle's freedom, and Grumps' implied eviction, by taking him on vacation, while Hector becomes acquainted with a new talented animal: a beatboxing rattlesnake named Malfoy, owned by Josh's friend, Trudy."

        "In the United States and Canada, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile was released alongside Amsterdam, and was projected to gross $11\u201312 million from 4,350 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.5 million on its first day, including $575,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $11.5 million, finishing second behind holdover Smile.

        "Cath Clarke of The Guardian gave the film a mixed review giving it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Javier Bardem marches away with the film as flamboyant failed showman Hector P Valenti. Next to his dazzle, everything else about Lyle, Lyle Crocodile, adapted from Bernard Waber's much-loved picture books, looks a bit average.\"",
        "Ryan Leston for IGN called the film \"charming\", praising the character of Hector writing: \"Sure, it's not exactly original, essentially a mish-mash of similar films including Hop and Sing, and most of the laughs feel familiar. But Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile conjures up enough of the old showbiz charm to win you over. It's heart-warming, too \u2013 Lyle may be the singer, but he helps those around him find their voice, and sometimes that's exactly what we need: a singing crocodile to just be a good pal.\"",
        "Robert Abele was less than positive with his review writing for The Wrap: \"Did Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile look good in storyboards or sound fun in creative meetings? Because it's a certifiable mess on its webbed hind feet, teetering uncomfortably as both fanciful family comedy and live-action/animated musical, whether trying to make dumpster diving look whimsical (it isn't) or the tunes sound like anything but positivity-anthem-generator readouts.\"",
        "Nell Minow, writing for RogerEbert.com, was more positive in her review of the film, giving it a score of 3 out of 4 stars. She wrote: \"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a bit too long for a family movie, with some unnecessary complications toward the end, and it's not quite up to the Paddington level of movie adaptations of classic children's books. But it is a warm-hearted family film with great musical numbers that will make another generation of kids hopefully search the attic on the chance that they might find a singing crocodile.\"",
        "Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile was nominated for Best Family Movie at the Movieguide Awards. The film also received a nomination for Best Digital \u2013 Animation/Family at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards."
