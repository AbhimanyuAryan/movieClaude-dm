        "A film adaptation of Here by Richard McGuire was announced in February 2022. The film is produced by Playtone and ImageMovers and written by Eric Roth, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and will star Tom Hanks. By the time the Cannes Film Market began in May, Robin Wright had been cast and Miramax joined as the main financier and international sales agent, with Sony Pictures Releasing acquiring U.S. distribution rights at Cannes later. Paul Bettany and Kelly Reilly joined the cast in September. In February 2023, Leslie Zemeckis joined the cast. In April, Michelle Dockery and Gwilym Lee were added to the cast.",
        "Production was planned to begin in September 2022. It would instead begin by January 2023 in London, with production taking place at Pinewood Studios. The film uses a new generative artificial intelligence technology called Metaphysic Live to face-swap and de-age the actors in real time as they perform instead of using additional post-production processing methods."
