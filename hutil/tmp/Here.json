It reunites Hanks and Wright, as well as Zemeckis and Roth together, for the first time in thirty years after the release of Forrest Gump in 1994.[3]\nHere is scheduled to be premiered in Los Angeles and New York on November 15, 2024, by TriStar Pictures and Sony Pictures Releasing, followed by a limited theatrical release and wide release on November 22 and November 27, 2024, respectively.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nThe story covers the events of a single room and its inhabitants spanning from the past to well into the future.\n\nCast[edit]\nTom Hanks\nRobin Wright\nPaul Bettany\nKelly Reilly\nMichelle Dockery\nLeslie Zemeckis as Elizabeth Franklin\nLauren McQueen as young Elizabeth\nBeau Gadsdon as teen Elizabeth\nGwilym Lee as John Harter\nJonathan Aris as Earl Higgins\nAlbie Salter as Jimmy\nHarry Marcus as young Jimmy\nLilly Aspell as Bethany\nBen Wiggins\nJoel Oulette as Indigenous Man\nDannie McCallum as Indigenous Woman\nOphelia Lovibond as Stella Beekman\nNikki Amuka-Bird as Helen Harris\nAnya Marco Harris as Raquel\nDavid Fynn as Leo\nMohammed George as Winston\nProduction[edit]\nA film adaptation of Here by Richard McGuire was announced in February 2022. The film is produced by Playtone and ImageMovers and written by Eric Roth, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and will star Tom Hanks.[4] By the time the Cannes Film Market began in May, Robin Wright had been cast and Miramax joined as the main financier and international sales agent, with Sony Pictures Releasing acquiring U.S. distribution rights at Cannes later.[5] Paul Bettany and Kelly Reilly joined the cast in September.[6][7] In February 2023, Leslie Zemeckis joined the cast.[8] In April, Michelle Dockery and Gwilym Lee were added to the cast.[9][10]\nProduction was planned to begin in September 2022. It would instead begin by January 2023 in London, with production taking place at Pinewood Studios.[11] The film uses a new generative artificial intelligence technology called Metaphysic Live to face-swap and de-age the actors in real time as they perform instead of using additional post-production processing methods.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nHere is scheduled to be premiere in Los Angeles and New York on November 15, 2024, by TriStar Pictures through Sony Pictures Releasing, followed by a limited release in the United States on November 22, 2024 and a wider release on November 27, 2024.[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Alan Silvestri Scoring Robert Zemeckis' 'Here'\".
