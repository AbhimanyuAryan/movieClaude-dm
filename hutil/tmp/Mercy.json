Meanwhile, FBI agents McBride and Ellis has arrested Ryan Quinn, the brother of Sean Quinn and the son of Patrick \"Paddy\" Quinn, whose family is the member of the Irish mob called the Quinn Gang Brotherhood responsible for committing series of crimes in the United States. While bringing Ryan to the custody, Sean and his henchmen \u2013 Johnno, Danny, and Mick \u2013 ambush the convoy, kill the agents and injure McBride. Sean shoots Ryan twice in a close range. Ellis escapes and brings McBride and Ryan to the hospital.\nSean calls his father Paddy about Ryan, and they determine to go to the hospital to get Ryan out. As they arrive at the hospital, they kill the receptionist and take the visitors and staffs hostage, while Michelle hides Bobby inside the locker. McBride manages to hide Ryan in the upper floor of the building. While finding for Ryan, Sean kills McBride by disconnecting the ventilator. The police arrive at the scene but Sean threatens to kill every hostage if they attempt to storm the hospital. Using her combat skills, Michelle kills Mick after a struggle. Bobby is found and is taken hostage. Paddy calls Michelle to bring Ryan in exchange of her son's life. Sean puts security guard and Michelle's friend Frank a bomb vest and relays the message to the police not to intervene before Sean activates the bomb, killing Frank.\nPaddy confronts Sean for jeopardizing the job. Sean reveals to his father that Ryan has tipped off their illegal business to the FBI, so that's the reason why Sean is going after Ryan. Michelle finds Danny making a bomb and, after the struggle, kills him. Michelle makes a deal with Sean of exchanging Bobby and Ryan. At the morgue, Michelle bring Ryan to Paddy and Sean, and has Bobby back in her arms. Ryan reveals to Paddy that Sean shoot him in point blank. Paddy confronts Sean about it, stating that he will never forgive him. When Sean confronts Paddy for his mother's death because of Paddy's negligence, Paddy attacks Sean, who shoots his father in the abdomen. Before losing consciousness, Paddy resents of failing Sean as a father. The police storm the building, kill the remaining henchmen and rescue the hostages.\nEllis kills Johnno after the latter attempt to catch Bobby, who escapes into the tunnel, and Sean shoots Michelle, knocking her unconscious for a moment, before activating the time bomb and escapes. Recovering, Michelle manages to diffuse the bomb in time before heading to the tunnel where Ellis takes Bobby hostage. Bobby is able to stomp Sean's feet, allowing Michelle to kill him. Ryan and Paddy are taken to another hospital, and Ellis commends Michelle for her bravery before heading home.\n\nCast[edit]\nLeah Gibson as Michelle\nJonathan Rhys Meyers as Sean Quinn\nJon Voight as Patrick \"Paddy\" Quinn\nSebastien Roberts as Ellis\nAnthony Konechny as Ryan Quinn\nPatrick Roccas as Johnno\nAnthony Bolognese as Bobby\nBradley Stryker as Mick\nCaitlin Stryker as Agent Cruz\nMark Masterton as Danny\nRyan Russell as Nurse Kevin\nBobby Stewart as Dr. Terrence\nMarc-Anthony Massiah as Frank\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released in theaters on May 12, 2023 and digitally on May 19, 2023.[2] It was also released on demand on June 2, 2023.[3][4]  It was originally going to be released in theaters on May 19.[5]\n\nReception[edit]\nJeffrey M.
