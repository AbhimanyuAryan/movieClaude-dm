The film stars Jason Statham, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Josh Hutcherson, Bobby Naderi, Phylicia Rashad, Jemma Redgrave and Jeremy Irons. When his good-hearted landlady commits suicide after losing her charity's funds to a phishing scam, former \"Beekeeper\" operative Adam Clay sets out on a brutal campaign for revenge upon those responsible. \nThe Beekeeper was released in the United States by Amazon MGM Studios under the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer label on January 12, 2024. The film received generally positive reviews and has grossed $152.7 million worldwide, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nRetired schoolteacher Eloise Parker lives by herself in Massachusetts, but she has a tenant in her barn, Adam Clay, living a quiet life as a beekeeper. One day, Eloise falls for a phishing scam and is robbed of over $2 million, the majority of which belongs to a charity organization she manages. Devastated, she dies from suicide. Adam finds her body and is immediately arrested by FBI agent Verona Parker, Eloise's daughter. After Eloise's death is ruled a suicide, Adam is released. Verona tells him the group that robbed Eloise has been on the FBI's radar for a while but is difficult to track. Wanting justice for Eloise, Adam contacts the Beekeepers, a mysterious group, to find the scammers responsible.\nAdam receives an address for the scammers: a call center run by Mickey Garnett. Adam scares off the employees and destroys the building. Mickey informs his boss, technology executive Derek Danforth, who sends Mickey to kill Adam. A violent confrontation ensues where Adam kills Mickey's men and severs Mickey's fingers on his right hand with a bandsaw. Mickey calls Derek while stopped at a bridge, informing him that Adam is a Beekeeper. Having followed Mickey, Adam drags him off the bridge with a truck to his death and warns Derek that he is coming after him.\nDerek informs former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, who is currently running security for Danforth Enterprises at the request of Derek's mother, Jessica, about Adam. Concerned, Wallace contacts the current CIA director in hopes of stopping Adam. The director contacts the Beekeepers and learns that Adam has retired from the organization. The Beekeepers subsequently declare neutrality after Adam kills the current Beekeeper Anisette Landress sent to kill him. Meanwhile, Verona and her partner, Matt Wiley, anticipate that Adam will deliver an assault on the Nine Star United Center in Boston, which oversees all of Derek's global scam call centers. After informing FBI Deputy Director Prigg that Adam is a Beekeeper, they receive all the support they ask for.\nWallace coordinates a group of ex-special forces personnel, revealing to them that the Beekeepers are a highly skilled and dangerous clandestine human intelligence organization tasked with protecting the United States, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction. To have a chance at stopping Adam, Wallace orders the group to secure the inside of the Nine Star Building, while the FBI places their own SWAT team around the perimeter. However, Derek's refusal to evacuate the employees enables Adam to quickly defeat the FBI SWAT team and infiltrate the building. After wiping out all of Wallace\u2019s ex-special forces group, Adam proceeds to interrogate the manager, who reveals that Derek is his boss.\nVerona informs FBI Deputy Director Prigg that Derek runs both companies, which several US government agencies use. Verona also brings up the point that not only will Adam attempt to kill Derek, but he may also kill Jessica, the president of the United States, due to her association with the scam. As Adam eludes capture, Wallace advises Derek to stay with his mother under Secret Service protection. \nAt the president's beachside mansion, Wallace hires a group of mercenaries, one of whom named Lazarus previously had an encounter with a Beekeeper and lost his leg. Adam infiltrates the mansion, while Jessica learns the truth from Prigg about Derek's exploitation of a CIA program during her presidential campaign. Jessica decides that when Adam approaches, she will tell him and the world the truth about Derek's use of the program. Enraged, Derek kills Prigg and takes his mother hostage. Adam fights his way to the president's office, killing the mercenaries and Lazarus in the process. Wallace talks to Adam to persuade him to turn away at the last moment but fails. Adam eventually reaches Jessica's office, being quickly joined by Verona, Matt, and the rest of the FBI agents. \nVerona tries to dissuade Adam from killing Jessica and Derek. Derek attempts to kill his mother, but Adam kills him first and escapes through a nearby window and onto the beach. Despite Verona having a clear shot, she decides not to shoot Adam. He flees with the aid of the underwater gear he had hidden on the beach.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJason Statham as Adam Clay[2]\nEmmy Raver-Lampman as Special Agent Verona Parker\nBobby\u00a0Naderi as Special Agent Matt Wiley[3]\nJosh Hutcherson as Derek Danforth [3]\nJeremy Irons as Wallace Westwyld[3]\nDavid Witts as Mickey Garnett\nMichael Epp as Pettis\nTaylor James as Lazarus\nPhylicia Rashad as Eloise Parker[2]\nJemma Redgrave as President Jessica Danforth\nMinnie Driver as CIA Director Janet Harward[2]\nDon Gilet as FBI Deputy Director Jackson Prigg\nSophia Feliciano as Kelly Krane\nEnzo Cilenti as Rico Anzalone\nMegan Le as Anisette Landress\nDan Li as Agent Kim\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn August 2021, it was announced that Jason Statham would star in the film for Miramax, and would also serve as a producer.[4] David Ayer signed on to direct in May 2022.[5]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in September 2022 in the United Kingdom.[6] In October, Statham shot scenes at Tyringham Hall in Tyringham.[7] Filming wrapped that December.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired the film's distribution rights in the United States in August 2022.[6] In February 2023, Sky Cinema acquired the rights in the United Kingdom.[3] It was released by Amazon MGM Studios on January 12, 2024.[9][2]\nThe Beekeeper\u00a0was released on VOD and digital platforms on\u00a0January 30, 2024.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe Beekeeper grossed $66.2\u00a0million domestically (United States and Canada) and $86.5\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $152.7\u00a0million,[11] against a budget of \"$40\u00a0million or less\".[12] It spent its first eight weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office, peaking at No. 1 in its third week.[13]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 71% of 170 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Cheerfully undemanding and enjoyably retrograde, The Beekeeper proves that when it comes to dispensing action-thriller justice, Statham hasn't lost his sting.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15]\nA review in The Guardian says the non-shooting scenes are rushed and both Rashad and Driver are underused, and describes it as \"a solid, low-stakes, medium-reward new year's effort\".[16] RogerEbert.com's Matt Zoller Seitz praised various aspects of the film, including its range of villains, but regretted: \"It's a real shame that 'The Beekeeper' isn't the righteous trash masterpiece that it keeps threatening to turn into.\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Beekeeper (15)\".
