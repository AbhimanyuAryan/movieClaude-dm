    "Plot": [
        "In an attempt to practice one of their extreme stunts, Crash and Eddie accidentally cause an avalanche and destroy the gang's summer habitat. Manny, Sid, Diego, and Ellie get mad at them, declaring they would not survive on their own. Wanting to prove them wrong, Crash and Eddie secretly leave their temporary camp while the others are asleep. Finding them gone the next morning, Ellie insists that they go search for them. Meanwhile, Crash and Eddie stumble upon the entrance to the Lost World, a land full of dinosaurs, and run into their old friend Buck, who saves them from raptors and tells them that a Protoceratops named Orson, who was bullied when he was young for having a massive brain, has escaped from exile and has come to conquer the Lost World. Buck tries to get Crash and Eddie back to their home, but finds out that Orson has covered the entrance with a boulder.",
        "Buck and the possums go to Buck's shelter, where Buck explains how he used to be part of an old team that established a watering hole as a place for animals to peacefully co-exist. He goes on to say that Orson did not accept an offer to join his team because he believed in a world where the strong dominate the weak, with him being the leader. Buck further explains that they defeated Orson and banished him to an island, where he learned that he can control two raptors with fire.",
        "The two raptors find Buck's hideout, but Zee, a zorilla who used to be part of Buck's former team, saves Buck and the possums by using a gas to knock out the raptors. Orson then gets an army of raptors and attacks the watering hole, with Buck and Zee telling the animals to evacuate. Buck and Zee, their relationship strained after their team's breakup, go with the possums to get help. They arrive at the Lost Lagoon and summon their old friend Momma, a Tyrannosaurus. When Orson and his raptors arrive and attack them again, Buck and Zee forgive each other for breaking up the old team and agree to work together. Acting as a diversion, Buck is captured by Orson, allowing the others to escape.",
        "Trying to figure out how Orson controls the raptors, Zee and the possums devise a plan to get Buck back. Ellie, Manny, Sid, and Diego find out that Crash and Eddie entered the Lost World and uncover the entrance. They run into Momma, who gives them a ride to the watering hole, where Orson has taken Buck to feed his raptors, planning to use him as an example for anyone who refuses to follow his rules. Zee and the possums free Buck and fight Orson and his army, with Manny, Sid, Diego, Ellie, and Momma joining in the battle. Buck tries to explain to Orson that everyone needs to live in peace, but Orson arrogantly rebuffs him and continues to fight. After figuring out that Orson controls the raptors with fire, Crash and Eddie create a fire of their own and stop the raptors from fighting and make the two raptors chase Orson instead, saving the Lost World.",
        "Ellie, Manny, Sid, and Diego apologize to Crash and Eddie for doubting them and ask them to come home, but Crash and Eddie express that they want to stay in the Lost World with Buck and Zee. Sad to not be with them anymore yet proud to see that their adventure with Buck made them more mature, Ellie allows Crash and Eddie to stay and says goodbye, but Crash and Eddie still come to visit the gang often."

        "In July 2016, Bustle noted that the chance of a sixth entry to the Ice Age franchise was relatively high but would depend on the box office performance of the fifth film.",
        "In August 2018, 20th Century Fox CEO Stacey Snider announced the development of a television series centered around the character of Buck, produced by Blue Sky Studios. In December 2020, the project was confirmed to have been redeveloped as a film titled Ice Age: Adventures of Buck Wild, centering around Buck going on an adventure in the Dinosaur World with Crash and Eddie, during the Disney Investor Day 2020 event. Simon Pegg was reported to be reprising his role as Buck.",
        "Blue Sky was closed on April 10, 2021, and consequently, many of their upcoming projects were cancelled. Unlike the previous Ice Age films released by 20th Century Fox and produced by 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky, the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures. Despite this, production on Ice Age: Adventures of Buck Wild continued. When the teaser poster was unveiled, it was revealed that the title had changed from Ice Age: Adventures of Buck Wild to The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, including the word 'the' at the beginning of the title. On January 14, 2022, director John C. Donkin and executive producer Lori Forte said that Blue Sky was never involved in the film. This would later be confirmed by Ice Age: Scrat Tales producers, Chris Wedge, Michael Knapp, and Anthony Nisl in an April 2022 interview with Paste.",
        "Simon Pegg reprised his role as Buck from Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Ice Age: Collision Course, having been confirmed to when the film was announced. However, he was the only actor to return from the previous films due to budget reasons.",
        "The animation was outsourced to Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver. Bardel had previously collaborated with Disney and 20th Century Animation on Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2021). Around 80 people were involved in the creation of The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild. Almost all the production was done remotely which led Donkin to never having a meeting with the entire team. Donkin said, \"It was a pretty lean crew. But yet, everybody was able to really concentrate and work hard from their homes.\" He also said that they finished production on the film in late 2020.",
        "Batu Sener composed the musical score. The soundtrack was released on January 28, 2022, by Hollywood Records and Walt Disney Records.",
        "Sener's score was nominated for Public Choice Award at the 2022 edition of World Soundtrack Awards."

    "Reception": [
        "According to Whip Media's viewership tracking app TV Time, The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild was the 10th-most-anticipated movie of January 2022. According to data from Samba TV, 797,000 US households watched The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild in its first 2 days of streaming. According to Whip Media's viewership tracking app TV Time, The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild was the 8th-most-watched film across all platforms in the United States during the week of January 28, 2022, to January 30, 2022, and the 10th during the week of February 4, 2022, to February 6, 2022.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 19% of 37 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.7/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 30 out of 100 based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".",
        "Courtney Howard of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying how the story's focus is on the major characters of the previous Ice Age films, rather than solely on the titular Buck. She also points out the problematic disability representation and how the animation is \"akin to a late-stage pre-viz pass\", ending the review saying that the film \"should've remained on ice.\" Natalia Winkleman of The New York Times said that she was disappointed to see the film replace almost all of its celebrity voices and stated that of all the \"sins\" in the movie, the omission of Scrat was unforgivable. Laura Millar from The Michigan Daily wrote that she was somewhat disappointed in the cast change and the \"elementary plot\", but said that she was most upset that the film was not made for the same audience as the past Ice Age films. Johnny Loftus of Decider complimented Simon Pegg's performance, but said the world depicted across the movie appears empty and generic, and found the appearances of several characters uninteresting, writing, \"The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild feels like a tangent, or perhaps a try-out pilot for a small screen Crash & Eddie \u2018toon. What it doesn\u2019t feel like is a feature film.\"",
        "Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild [...] has frequent animated action involving perilous situations and some mild language. [...] Characters discover qualities in themselves that allow them to gain confidence and improve their relationships. The film has messages about existing peacefully alongside those who are different from you and being a contributing member of your herd [...] and there's some potty humor involving peeing, farting, and other bodily functions.\" Giving the film a D+, The A.V. Club's Jesse Hassenger negatively compared it to Disney's other direct-to-video sequels, saying: \"The new direct-to-streaming Ice Age sequel is a generic chunk of content.\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing: \"Visually and storytelling-wise it's not a cut above much of what kids can watch on TV these days. This is a franchise that looks like it's slowly going the way of the dinos, while we drool.\"",
        "Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild received a nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing \u2013 Non-Theatrical Animation at the 2022 Golden Reel Awards."
