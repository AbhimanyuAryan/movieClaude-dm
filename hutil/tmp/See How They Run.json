The film stars Sam Rockwell, Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Ruth Wilson, Reece Shearsmith, Harris Dickinson, and David Oyelowo.\nSee How They Run was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2022 and in North America on 16 September 2022, by Searchlight Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $22 million worldwide. It was nominated for Outstanding British Film at the 76th British Academy Film Awards, among other accolades.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1953 London, Agatha Christie's play The Mousetrap celebrates its 100th performance, and sleazy American director Leo K\u00f6pernick has been hired by producer John Woolf to direct the film adaptation. After K\u00f6pernick's drunken behaviour towards the female lead Sheila Sim leads to a fistfight with her husband and co-star Richard Attenborough, K\u00f6pernick is killed backstage by an unseen assailant.\nInspector Stoppard investigates the murder, shadowed by the inexperienced Constable Stalker. Everyone at the theatre is declared a suspect and a potential victim, including the play's producer Petula Spencer and Woolf's wife Edana Romney. Stoppard attempts to close the theatre until the murder is solved, but the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Harold Scott, intervenes, assigning Stalker to assist in the investigation.\nStoppard and Stalker search K\u00f6pernick's room at the Savoy Hotel, finding his address book of women's details. The hotel manager recalls K\u00f6pernick's violent argument with screenwriter Mervyn Cocker-Norris, who admits to arguing with K\u00f6pernick over the director's vision for an action-packed ending for The Mousetrap film. Mervyn, who lives with his hot-headed \"nephew\" Gio, remembers a \"plain woman\" arriving at the hotel with K\u00f6pernick's son.\nStoppard and Stalker question Woolf, who was blackmailed by K\u00f6pernick after he discovered Woolf's affair with his assistant, Ann. Dennis, an usher at the theatre, offers an unhelpful description of a suspicious figure; Attenborough and Sim are questioned as well. Spencer explains that she optioned The Mousetrap's film rights to Woolf, but he would be contractually unable to produce the adaptation until the show had closed.\nAt a pub, Stoppard bonds with Stalker and reveals that his unfaithful wife left him after having a child with another man. Driving a drunken Stoppard home, Stalker finds news articles and a picture of his ex-wife, fitting Mervyn's description of a \"homely woman with glasses\". Combined with Dennis' description, this leads Stalker to suspect Stoppard may be the killer, and she searches for his ex-wife in K\u00f6pernick's address book.\nStoppard and Stalker attend a performance of The Mousetrap, during which Mervyn, Woolf, Dennis, Gio and Stoppard leave the auditorium; Stalker soon follows after watching Stoppard retrieve his gloves. In the foyer, Mervyn is strangled to death by a gloved figure. Stalker spots Stoppard kneeling over the body and gives chase, knocking him unconscious with a snow shovel.\nStoppard awakens in a cell, and Stalker and Scott accuse him of carrying out the murders. Stalker has summoned Joyce, the mother of K\u00f6pernick's son, but she is not Stoppard's ex-wife, exonerating him. Stalker escorts Joyce and her son home, and Joyce mentions overhearing a man with a \"village idiot\" accent. Reading through Mervyn's research on The Mousetrap, Stoppard realises the identity of the killer and races to the suspect's apartment, where Stalker has already burst inside and found the necessary evidence: the killer is Dennis.  \nAttenborough, Sim, Woolf, Ann, Spencer and her elderly mother arrive at the home of Agatha Christie in Wallingford, Berkshire, having received invitations to dinner. The butler Fellowes is perplexed by their arrival, but Christie's husband, Max Mallowan, allows them inside. The group are held at gunpoint by Dennis, whom Spencer's mother recognises as Dennis Corrigan, an abused child whose brother's death inspired the plot of The Mousetrap. Dennis explains that he killed K\u00f6pernick and Mervyn in an attempt to stop the play and its adaptation, disgusted by the exploitation of his brother's tragedy for entertainment.\nHaving forged the invitations to lure everyone together, Dennis has captured Edana, mistaking her for Christie. Christie enters with tea, including a poisoned cup for Dennis which Fellowes inadvertently drinks instead. An armed Stoppard arrives and a shootout ensues; Sim distracts Dennis with a molotov cocktail, and Stalker nearly takes a bullet to save Stoppard, matching K\u00f6pernick's story pitch, before Agatha dispatches Dennis with a shovel. It is revealed that the bullet did, in fact, hit Stoppard, though the shot was not fatal. Some time later, Stalker passes her sergeant's exams and a recovering Stoppard receives the King's Police and Fire Services Medal, and they attend another performance of The Mousetrap together. At the very end of the film, Stoppard turns to the camera and asks the audience to keep the identity of the killer a secret, as happens at the end of the actual play The Mousetrap.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nSam Rockwell as Inspector George Stoppard, an alcoholic detective on the outs of his department who is assigned to the case\nSaoirse Ronan as Constable Stalker, an energetic and eager-to-please officer who is assigned to assist Stoppard\nAdrien Brody as Leo Kopernick, the director of The Mousetrap's film adaptation\nRuth Wilson as Petula Spencer, the producer of the play and broker for Agatha Christie\nReece Shearsmith as John Woolf, the producer of The Mousetrap's film adaptation\nHarris Dickinson as Richard Attenborough, the charismatic star of the play\nCharlie Cooper as Dennis Corrigan, an usher employed by the theatre\nDavid Oyelowo as Mervyn Cocker-Norris, a well-known playwright and screenwriter of The Mousetrap's film adaptation\nTim Key as Commissioner Harold Scott, Stoppard and Stalker's boss\nShirley Henderson as Agatha Christie, the famously reclusive writer of The Mousetrap\nLucian Msamati as Max Mallowan, Christie's enigmatic husband\nPippa Bennett-Warner as Ann Saville, Woolf's assistant and mistress\nPearl Chanda as Sheila Sim, Richard's wife and co-star of the play\nPaul Chahidi as Fellowes, Christie's clumsy butler\nSian Clifford as Edana Romney, Woolf's wife\nAnia Marson as Mother\nJacob Fortune-Lloyd as Gio, Cocker-Norris' \"nephew\"\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was announced in November 2020 as an untitled mystery film from Searchlight Pictures, with Tom George on board to direct from a screenplay by Mark Chappell.[1] Filming wrapped by April 2021.[2] The title was revealed to be See How They Run in July 2021.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nSee How They Run was released theatrically in the UK on 9 September 2022,[4][5] and in the US on 16 September. The film was originally set for a 30 September release in the US, but was brought forward by two weeks due to \"the lack of major studio product\" late in the year.[6]\nThe film was released for video on demand platforms on 1 November 2022.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nSee How They Run grossed $9.6\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $12.4\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $22\u00a0million.[8] The film received a wide release domestically, debuting at $3.1 million from 2,404 cinemas, finishing fourth at the box office for its first weekend; it held at fifth the following weekend, and fell out of the Top 10 at the box office in its third week.[9]\n\nStreaming viewership[edit]\nAccording to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, See How They Run was the 8th most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week of 31 October to 6 November 2022,[10] and the 10th during the week of 7 November to 13 November 2022.[11]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of 191 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"See How They Run may not do itself many favors by asking for Christie comparisons, but this is still one fun whodunit.\"[12] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[13]\nTeo Bugbee of The New York Times praised the film calling it \"a plummy affair, a proper figgy pudding baked out of once-stale Scotland Yard tropes.\"[14] Nell Minow of RogerEbert.com gave the film two and a half stars saying \"all the stylishness and enthusiasm cannot disguise the fact that the mystery itself never comes close to those concocted by Dame Agatha.\"[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kroll, Justin (20 November 2020). \"Saoirse Ronan, Sam Rockwell And David Oyelowo To Star In Untitled Murder Mystery For Searchlight\".
