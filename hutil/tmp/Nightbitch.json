It is based on the 2021 novel of the same name by Rachel Yoder.[1] The film stars Amy Adams, Scoot McNairy, and Zoe Chao.\nNightbitch is scheduled to be released in the United States by Searchlight Pictures on December 6, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nA stay-at-home mom decides to break her boring cycle and starts to believe that she is turning into a dog at night.[citation needed]\n\nCast[edit]\nAmy Adams\nScoot McNairy\nElla Thomas\nGarrett C. Phillips\nMary Holland\nZoe Chao[2]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn July 2020, Annapurna Pictures acquired the film rights to the then-unpublished Nightbitch, written by Rachel Yoder, with Amy Adams attached to star and produce.[3] Stacy O'Neil of Adams' Bond Group Entertainment production company will co-produce the film alongside Megan Ellison, Sue Naegle and Sammy Scher, while Yoder would serve as executive producer.[4] Can You Ever Forgive Me? filmmaker Marielle Heller connected with Yoder's novel and began to quietly develop the film alongside Adams during the COVID-19 pandemic.[5]\n\nPre-production[edit]\nIn March 2022, filming was scheduled to begin in the fall of that year.[6] In May, Searchlight Pictures acquired distribution rights from Annapurna for $25 million, winning out from five other bidders.[7] At this time, Heller's involvement was officially confirmed. Christina Oh, Adam Paulsen, and Heller had boarded the film as producers, while Scher moved to executive producer with Havilah Brewster.[8] On June 27, 2022, Scoot McNairy joined the film.[9][10]\n\nFilming[edit]\nProduction was intended to begin in September 2022 in Los Angeles.[11] It began in October 2022, with the announcement that Ella Thomas[12] and Garret Phillips had joined the cast.[13][14] On October 21, 2022, Mary Holland joined the cast.[15]\n\nRelease[edit]\nNightbitch was originally set to be released on Hulu,[16][17] but was later announced for a theatrical release by Searchlight Pictures for December 6, 2024.[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Nightbitch\".
