It stars Peter Dinklage, Marisa Tomei, Joanna Kulig, Brian d'Arcy James, and Anne Hathaway.\nIt had its world premiere at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 16, 2023, and was released on October 6, 2023, by Vertical Entertainment.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOperetta composer Steven Lauddem is creatively blocked and unable to finish the score for his big comeback opera. At the behest of his wife Patricia, a psychiatrist, he sets out in search of inspiration.\nTaking their dog for a walk, Steven stops at a bar. There, he meets Katrina, who convinces him to go with her to see her tugboat, where she lives and works. She confesses that she's addicted to romance, and seduces Steven. Realising he may be in danger, he hurries away.\nThe experience inspires Steven to write the work based on what happened, but making her character a serial killer. On opening night, not only does Patricia and their son come, but so does Katrina. She approaches him, happily letting him know that she's now staying in Brooklyn, and he hurries home, terrified.\nMeanwhile, Patricia's son, Julian, and Tereza, whose mother Magdalena turns out to be his family's new cleaner, are dating. Neither set of parents knew about the relationship, so they make formal introductions. Tereza's dad, Trey, does not approve of his daughter's choice of a dark-skinned boyfriend, so threatens to persecute Julian on statutory rape charges as Tereza is still underage and Julian has turned 18. As their lawyer comes for a consultation, Steven points out that Julian couldn't be prosecuted if they were married. \nWhen Katrina approaches Steven in the street, he brushes her off, insisting she needs psychological help. She books a session with Patricia and the truth comes out. Not able to handle the news, Patricia has a psychotic break. Afterwards, Magdalena pauses her cleaning to join Julian, Steven and a nun at Patricia's bedside. Julian requests she sign in person to authorize his marriage to Tereza in Delaware, where 16 year olds can marry with a parent's signature. \nOnce it is decided, mother and daughter work together on how to get around Trey. In the meantime, knowing of Katrina's addiction to romance, Steven enlists her help to transport everyone to Delaware. Trey makes his wife and daughter participate in one of his Civil War reenactment battles. They feign they are collecting wood, but instead run to Steven and the tug boat.\nTrey has a APB sent out for them, to no avail. As Steven, Magdalena and their kids settle in on their journey, it is suggested that Katrina become ordained online to officiate the ceremony. In the morning, Steven brings Captain Katrina her coffee in the cockpit. He apologizes for judging her previously, admiring her strength and perserverance. Katrina in turns laments her role in pushing Pat off the deep end. Declaring he finally feels he has found true love, Steven passionately kisses her.\nA year later, we see Steven's latest opera, set in space, but obviously inspired by the Delaware wedding. The young married couple, her mom, Steven and Katrina and Pat, who's now a nun, watch the premiere. In between parts of the work, we see snippets of the wedding.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nPeter Dinklage as Steven Lauddem[1]\nAnne Hathaway as Patricia Jessup-Lauddem[1]\nMarisa Tomei as Katrina Trento[1]\nEvan Ellison as Julian Jessup[1]\nHarlow Jane as Tereza  Szyskowski[1]\nJoanna Kulig as Magdalena Szyskowski[1]\nBrian d'Arcy James as Trey Ruffa[1]\nJudy Gold as Susan Shaw\nGregg Edelman as Duftin Haverford\nAalok Mehta as Anton Gatner[1]\nChris Gethard as Carl\nDale Soules as Aunt Moxie\nJen Ponton as Elodie\nIsabel Leonard, Emmet O'Hanlon, and Greer Grimsley portray characters in Steven's operas.\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn 2017, Steve Carell, Amy Schumer and Nicole Kidman were all attached to star in the film.[4][5][6] In 2021, Anne Hathaway, Tahar Rahim, Marisa Tomei, Joanna Kulig and Matthew Broderick were confirmed to star in the film.[7][8][9] Rahim and Broderick later left the project.\nPrincipal photography was set to take place in late 2021 in New York City,[10][11] but did not begin until April 2022.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film opened the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 16, 2023.[13] In May 2023, Vertical Entertainment acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.[14] It was released on October 6, 2023.[15] It was previously scheduled to be released on September 29, 2023.[16]\nShe Came to Me was released for digital platforms on November 10, 2023.[17]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 47% of 66 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10.
