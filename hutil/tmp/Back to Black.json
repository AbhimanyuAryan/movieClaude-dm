        "The film opens with scenes of Amy Winehouse's Jewish family background, her father Mitch and her grandmother \"Nan\" Cynthia, with their love for music and singing. Amy's close friend, Tyler hands his manager Nick a demo tape of Amy's recording and is impressed by her talent. She then signs a contract with Island Records and releases her first album Frank.",
        "After enjoying acclaimed success, her record label wish to alter some changes with her stage act, which Amy strongly disagrees with. Amy then reveals she needs time off to live her songs, and then meets Blake in a pub in Camden Town where they fall in love. Their relationship is soon troubled by Blake's cocaine addiction, Amy's alcoholism and her bulimia. After experiencing Amy's irritable behaviour, Blake reveals he thinks they would be better as friends and wants to work on things with his ex-girlfriend Becky, which leaves Amy heartbroken. Before going to New York, she learns her grandmother is dying of a lung cancer. After a difficult period of these traumatising events all happening at once, she then gathers inspiration to write her hit album Back to Black.",
        "Blake and Amy reconcile shortly after the release of her second album. They get married in Miami, Florida, much to Mitch's dismay. But soon after, Blake is arrested and then serves a 2 year-sentence in jail for preverting the course of justice. Before he is released and Amy has now become a drug addict, Blake reveals he has been having counselling and informs Amy that he wishes to divorce as he wants a fresh start.",
        "After various blackouts, Amy decides to accept \"rehab\". She later receives 5 Grammy Awards. A last scene shows her new home in Camden Square, where Amy is now clean of drugs and trying to tackle her alcohol dependance. After saying goodbye to her father Mitch for the final time, the paparazzi appear outside her gate and reveal that Blake has a new girlfriend and will be having a baby. The film concludes with a tearful Amy singing Tears Dry On Their Own to herself and finishes with her walking up the stairs to her demise."

    "Production": [
        "After the death of Winehouse in 2011, filmmakers attempted to create a feature biopic with various projects, including one in 2015 with Noomi Rapace attached to star, but none moved forward.  In October 2018, it was announced that Winehouse's estate had signed a deal to make a biopic about her life and career. In July 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that StudioCanal was moving forward with a feature film entitled Back to Black. Sam Taylor-Johnson directed from a script by Matt Greenhalgh. Alison Owen and Debra Hayward produced under their Monumental Pictures banner, alongside Nicky Kentish-Barnes.",
        "In January 2023, it was reported that Marisa Abela would star as Winehouse, and Jack O'Connell, Eddie Marsan and Lesley Manville were also cast. O'Connell portrays Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy's husband from 2007 to 2009. Marsan and Manville play Amy's father and grandmother, Mitch Winehouse and Cynthia Winehouse, respectively. Juliet Cowan portrays Amy's mother, Janis Winehouse. Nina Gold served as casting director.",
        "Principal photography took place in London from January to April 2023, with Polly Morgan serving as cinematographer. Scenes were filmed at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, outside Winehouse's first flat in Camden Town, and at Primrose Hill. In February, scenes were shot inside the Metropolis Studios in Chiswick. From 13 March to 18 March, production moved to Fitzrovia to film scenes at the Fitzroy Square. The following week Abela and O'Connell shot scenes at London Zoo.",

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 43% of 49 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.60/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Back to Black's sympathetic approach to its subject's story is an overdue antidote to the tabloid treatment she often received in life, even if the end results are disappointingly pedestrian.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was positive about the film and gave it a score of four out of five, writing, \"Back to Black is essentially a gentle, forgiving film and there are other, tougher, bleaker ways to put Winehouse's life on screen \u2013 but Abela conveys her tenderness, and perhaps most poignantly of all her youth, so tellingly at odds with that tough image and eerily mature voice.\" Variety's Owen Gleiberman found that \"Sam Taylor-Johnson's jazz-meets-rock-star drama exerts an authentic fascination, even as its dysfunctional-addict love story keeps us at a distance\". Nick Levine of NME also rated Back to Black four out of five, stating \"This film was always going to face accusations of being exploitative \u2013 given the way Winehouse was scrutinised when she was alive \u2013 but the naysayers needn\u2019t have worried. Taylor-Johnson\u2019s film (particularly the ending) is impressively deft and delicate\". Tim Robey of The Telegraph awarded the film three stars out of five, writing that \u201cMarisa Abela does a sterling job as the troubled star \u2013 but this overly cautious drama ducks away from saying anything truly enlightening.\u201d",
        "Hamish Macbain of the Evening Standard was critical of the film, writing \"The final scene, in particular, with its completely and utterly baseless, sensationalist implications, made me physically gasp in horror\". Charlotte O'Sullivan of The Independent gave the film a score of two out of five, stating that \"Despite strong performances from Marisa Abela and Jack O\u2019Connell as the late icon and her one-time husband Blake Fielder-Civil, Sam Taylor-Johnson's controversial film tiptoes around judging anyone who isn't part of the paparazzi \u2013 Blake and Amy\u2019s father Mitch get off scot-free\". Vikram Murthi writing for IndieWire concluded \"The palpable sincerity behind Back to Black almost makes its myriad weaknesses more glaring. Everyone involved in the film approaches the late artist with love and respect, but its tawdry instincts and misguided sense of responsibility let her memory down. Its refusal to delve into the ugly realities of addiction or pop stardom generates a vague portrait of a lost girl in need of saving\"."
