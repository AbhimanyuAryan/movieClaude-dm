Samon Fisher, Liz Garbus and Dan Cogan produced, and Paul Dugdale, Ray Rock and James Shin co-executive produced.[1][8]\nMost of the concert scenes were shot during Grande's show at The O2 Arena in London, England, United Kingdom.\n\nReception[edit]\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 57% based on seven critics, with an average rating of 5.4/10.[9] On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".[10] Chris Azzopardi of The New York Times gave plaudits to Grande's \"charming, relatable\" persona, and stated that the film captures the singer in \"a variety of other off-the-cuff moments that give you the impression that this Grammy winner could be your bestie\".[11]\nNME writer Hannah Mylrea gave the film 4 stars out of 5, commenting that Excuse Me, I Love You may not be the most revelatory music film, but \"it doesn't need to be\", since it is \"90 minutes of euphoric pure pop\".[12] Johnny Loftus of Decider complimented Grande's charisma, professionalism, and the film's camera work.[13] Dubbing the film \"a gift to pop stans\", Mashable's Rachel Thompson praised the film for how it reminds of the \"simpler times\" prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and admired its setlist. However, she underscored the absence of rehearsal videos like those in Beyonc\u00e9's Homecoming (2019) or Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), or like the songwriting footage found in Swift's Miss Americana (2020) and Lady Gaga's Five Foot Two (2017).[14]\nRating the film a C-grade, IndieWire critic David Ehlrich compared Excuse Me, I Love You to a \"commercial for a well-manufactured human product\", and described it as \"a lame attempt to peek behind the curtain\". He thought that the film fails to achieve its full potential, unlike the intimacy of Miss Americana.[15] Scoring the film 2 out of 5 stars, Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media pointed out that Grande has \"seemingly effortless vocal talent\", but the concert is \"so meticulously choreographed and staged that they feel almost as much about the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne as the music\". Green downplayed the film's editing, and highlighted the presence of superficial chats instead of insight into Grande's life and personality.[16]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2021\n\nMTV Movie & TV Awards\n\nBest Music Documentary\n\nNominated\n\n[17]\n\nSetlist[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.
