The film is directed by Hannah Marks from a screenplay by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, and stars Isabela Merced. The story centers on a 16-year-old with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder who pursues the disappearance of a billionaire.\nThe project began development at Fox 2000 Pictures in December 2017, with Berger and Aptaker announced as screenwriters and Marks set to direct it in January 2019. Because The Walt Disney Company acquired 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox 2000 Pictures, Disney closed Fox 2000 and put the project into turnaround, until it was eventually acquired by New Line Cinema. Merced, who had starred in another adaptation of Green's work, Let It Snow (2019), was announced in February 2022. Principal photography began in April of the same year in Cincinnati and ended in June. \nTurtles All the Way Down is scheduled for release on May 2, 2024, on the streaming service Max.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nSee also: Turtles All the Way Down (novel) \u00a7\u00a0Plot summary\n\"When a 16-year-old struggling with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder reconnects with her childhood crush, she confronts the possibility of finding love and happiness in the face of mental illness.\"\n\nCast[edit]\nIsabela Merced as Aza Holmes\nCree Cicchino as Daisy Ramirez\nFelix Mallard as Davis Pickett\nJudy Reyes as Gina Holmes\nMaliq Johnson as Mychal Turner\nJ.
