Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker were announced as screenwriters in May 2018 and Hannah Marks was announced as director in January 2019. After The Walt Disney Company acquired and subsequently closed Fox 2000 Pictures, the project was put into turnaround until it was eventually acquired by New Line Cinema with distribution rights later passing to the streaming service HBO max/max. The film is also produced by Marty Bowen, Wyck Godfrey, and Isaac Klausner of Temple Hill Entertainment which also produced screen adaptations of Green's previous novels.",
