    "Plot": [
        "Twin brothers Rhian and Rafal founded the School for Good and Evil to groom fairy tale heroes (called \"Evers\") and villains (called \"Nevers\") respectively. Dissatisfied with evil's constant submission to good, Rafal attacks Rhian using blood magic, they both seem to fall off a cliff, but presumably Rafal dies.",
        "Years later, in the village of Gavaldon, best friends Sophie and Agatha learn about the legendary school from the bookshop owner. While Agatha is skeptical, fairy tale-obsessed Sophie dreams of escaping ordinary life and becoming a princess. Nights later, Sophie attempts to run away from Gavaldon in secret. When Agatha finds out and tries to intervene, a giant stymph snatches them both, flying them to the magical School for Good and Evil.",
        "To their dismay, however, Agatha is dropped at the School for Good while Sophie is delivered to the School for Evil. Agatha protests, wishing to return to Gavaldon, while Sophie insists she belongs in Good. Both girls seek out School Master Rhian and the magical Storian pen. He says he will only allow Sophie to switch schools if she can prove herself an Ever by attaining true love's kiss. She casts Prince Tedros, the son of King Arthur, as her true love and enlists Agatha's help.",
        "Agatha and Sophie struggle in their respective classes and are outcast by their peers. Though Agatha is vocally critical of Good's superficiality, Ever Dean Clarissa Dovey argues her sense of empathy makes her the first true princess in a long time. Meanwhile, Rafal manifests as a wasp swarm and defends Sophie from another student's attack. Never Dean Leonora Lesso interprets this as Sophie's unique potential for winning a victory for Evil, something thought impossible for centuries.",
        "When Sophie tries to get close to Tedros, Lesso cuts her hair to break her spirit. Under Rafal's influence, Sophie undergoes a radical change in appearance and personality; gaining the favor of the Nevers and rising to the unofficial position of leader of Evil's student body. Though she diverges from Agatha, the latter still tries to aid Sophie by using magic to bring her and Tedros together.",
        "An Ever and a Never being together causes chaos between both schools; Rhian determines a \"Trial by Tale\" to settle the issue. During the Trial, Sophie ends up proving inept in defending herself and Tedros, prompting an infiltrating Agatha to save him in her stead. This results in him rejecting Sophie for choosing self-preservation over him, with the prince starting a relationship with Agatha.",
        "Convinced by Rafal that Agatha is her enemy, Sophie accepts his offer of blood magic. Sophie incapacitates Dovey, Lesso, and the other school staff, and crashes the Evers' Ball, now physically transformed into a hag. She threatens Agatha and goads Tedros into attacking the School for Evil. However, by attacking, the Evers break the law of \"Good defends, Evil attacks\"; resulting in the Nevers and Evers magically switching appearances and a battle breaking out.",
        "Sophie attempts to seek revenge on Rhian, who reveals himself to have been Rafal all along, having survived the fall and killed Rhian, assuming his identity and manipulating Good's stories to weaken it from within, favoring Evil. He then proposes he and Sophie rule together, declaring her his true love.",
        "As they kiss, both Schools start collapsing, horrifying Sophie. When Agatha arrives, Rafal tries to impale her with the Storian, which he had forced to put in the story it has written. Sophie pushes Agatha out of the way and takes the fatal hit; her sacrifice undoes both Rafal's spell and already written fate on Agatha, saving everyone. Agatha, with a dying Sophie and Tedros' help, kills Rafal with Excalibur. She then kisses the dying Sophie goodbye; this demonstration of true love revives Sophie.",
        "The Evers and Nevers reconcile, and the restored school staff decide to unite the two schools into one. A portal to Gavaldon opens, and Agatha kisses Tedros before crossing over with Sophie, returning to their old lives. However, a portal opens piercing the veil between worlds and an arrow flies through, with Tedros pleading he needs Agatha; the Storian then states that \"this is only the beginning.\""

    "Production": [
        "In 2011, studios reportedly considered a film adaptation based on The School for Good and Evil series. Shortly after the publication of the first book of the series in 2013, Roth Films partnered with Jane Startz Productions to acquire rights to produce a film based on the novel. Universal Pictures won the auction in a seven-figure deal for book and scriptwriting fees. Roth, Startz and Palak Patel were appointed producers. Chainani and Malia Scotch Marmo were hired to write the screenplay, with the former writing the initial two drafts. In July 2015, Chainani stated he and Scotch Marmo finished writing the script.",
        "After the film languished in development hell, Netflix purchased the rights with a new team that included David Magee and Laura Solon as screenwriters in 2017. The streaming service expressed interest in live-action family films since most family films were animated. Other studios frequently rejected big-budget productions because of the expenses or the risks of releasing a family film that was not based on preexisting intellectual property; however, Netflix's ambition to find films that appeal to all ages led it to buy those productions, such as The School for Good and Evil.",
        "Paul Feig was offered a spot as director, but he was hesitant due to the film's contrasts with his style and unfamiliar genre. However, he reconsidered after he read the script, in which he enjoyed the characters, story, and opportunities for world-building. He was also interested in the relationships between the characters, as well as good and evil. Feig aimed to depict the lead characters' female friendship interestingly, as such relationships were often portrayed contentiously onscreen. Feig joined in 2020, with Roth, Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, Startz, Laura Fischer and Feig as producers, and Zack Roth, Patricia Riggen and Chainani as executive producers. Netflix was supportive of Feig's rewrites and changes.",
        "Chainani said the film would be a \"very different animal\" from the book. Feig stated that he is \"very against any movies where you have to know things before you go there\". The scenes were retrofitted so that they would still be unique from the books, but in a way that would hopefully please the fans. They often had to examine certain passages very closely to ensure they were not just recreating clich\u00e9s. While the novels are targeted towards young adults, Feig set out to create \"an anti-Disney\" film that, while reinterpreting fairy tales, also probed genuine issues\u00a0and darkness. In the books, the students are in their mid-teenage years; Feig, however, believed The School for Good and Evil did not necessarily need to be set at a high school. In the film, the students are approximately 18 to 19 years old. As the film developed, the team required more money for various things; Netflix subsequently increased the budget.",
        "Fiona Weir was appointed casting director. Feig made note to select talented, nice, and cooperative actors; Chainani stated casting was based on talent, not looks. Characters were reinterpreted to \"make sure [their] spirit\u00a0... is best embodied in that particular actor\". According to Chainani, casting Hester was difficult due to her \"very, very specific energy\". Laurence Fishburne joined the cast as the School Master due to his daughter's love for the books, which she started reading as a tween.",
        "Actresses Sophia Anne Caruso and Sofia Wylie were cast in the roles of Sophie and Agatha, respectively. Caruso learned of The School for Good and Evil after a general meeting with Feig. The script was sent to her shortly after; Caruso was impressed by the writing. However, Feig's collaborative and optimistic attitude, as well as his acting experience, was what ultimately persuaded Caruso to join the cast. Wylie auditioned for Agatha through a series of self-tapes and a chemistry read with Caruso. Feig said she submitted the \"most amazing audition\" and wanted to cast her immediately. According to Caruso, Wylie was clearly \"easy to talk to and friendly\", with the two having \"an immediate connection\".",
        "After Charlize Theron had completed work on F9 (2021), Kirschenbaum spoke to her about portraying \"a different kind\" of villain. She previously acted in many fantasy films, such as Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). Feig, who had worked with her on Arrested Development (2005), expected her to decline the role due to The School for Good and Evil's similarities to her other films. However, Lady Lesso differed from her other roles as a teacher who relished evil, allowing Theron to \"have much more fun in a way than some of those movies where you have to be very serious\".",
        "Feig had long sought to collaborate with Kerry Washington, but their schedules had never allowed it. He knew as soon as he read Professor Dovey's role that he wanted only Washington to play the part, partially due to her comedic skills. Compelled by the idea of working with Feig and Theron, Washington accepted. After reading The School for Good and Evil, she realized that Dovey was different from any character she had portrayed, being \"so larger than life and filled with light, and [having] a lot of comedic beats\". For the character's foundation, Washington made the decision to draw on real-life examples. She gave considerable thought to the archetype of fairy godmothers and finishing schools, as well as one of her instructors at Spence School, an all-girls school in New York that she had attended.",
        "Feig did not want the film to look similar to the Harry Potter film series and thus chose Andy Nicholson as production designer. Due to Feig's dislike of green screens and hope for \"the characters and the actors to be performing in that world so they become part of it\", much of the scenery was constructed, including the Schools for Good and Evil. The two sound stages constructed at Belfast Harbour Studios played a crucial role in that. The only scenes that used green screens were those in the beginning and those including Rafal, since the skies had to be altered. The film's style takes inspiration from Art Nouveau, which Feig noticed while filming Spy (2015) in Budapest, Hungary. Feig stated that this avoided comparisons to other films, being \"both garish and over the top\". Nicholson subsequently incorporated elements from other architects, including Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Victor Horta, creating \"this big melting point of design\". The team was allowed to \"take over\" St Anne's Cathedral. During the two weeks they worked there, the crew transformed the area into \"this big, almost sound-stage type space\u00a0... with so much detail\".",
        "Over 800 costumes and 600 pairs of shoes were produced by more than 70 costumers. The costumes maintained the design's individuality and distinctiveness, with Rene\u00e9 Kalfus and Feig designing them. For the creative team, it felt fitting that each character would bring their own sense of style and culture given that many of the characters are the children of well-known fairy tale characters. Feig said he allowed Kalfus creative freedom with this concept. The costumes were inspired by a variety of media, including classic fairy tales and Beyonc\u00e9. The actors were encouraged to contribute to their costumes. In particular, Theron wanted Lesso to have a tailored and severe silhouette; she also suggested the ginger hair and showed Feig various reference photos. Caruso discussed Sophie's evolution of style with Kalfus, including with \"princessy\" dresses and \"potato sack\" uniform at the School for Evil. She eventually transitions into punk glam costumes, which Caruso felt needed \"such a specific type of hot that suits her fiery spirit\". Wylie insisted on keeping her curly hair, wanting to show such hair can still be associated with princesses. Professor Dovey's blond bouffant wig took seven weeks to produce, including one to create its color; designer Linda Villalobos chose its look to highlight her goodness and prevent her from looking evil, as well as demonstrate texture. The wolf characters are portrayed by men in suits wearing animatronic heads so the actors had something to act against.",
        "According to Feig, filming on location was essential in order to avoid overusing special effects. Netflix was unable to shoot the production at its Shepperton Studios in Surrey, because it was too small; they decided to instead film at Northern Ireland for the first time. Feig selected its city Belfast as the filming location, as he had friends who had shot there, including production members from Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019). He also cited its close proximity to London, which would make travel between the two cities easy, though this was not the case due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shot at several locations in Belfast, including Belfast Harbour Studios and Loop Film Studios. At the former, the full 125,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (11,600\u00a0m) of the studio, workshop and office space was used. Derry was also considered as a filming location but was rejected for numerous reasons. Local sites The School for Good and Evil was filmed at include St Peter's Church; St Anne's Cathedral; Mount Stewart; Ulster Folk Museum; Clandeboye Estate; Woodburn Forest; Castle Archdale; and Antrim Road.",
        "Production followed the British Film Commission safe working protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Feig was particularly pleased to film at Big Dog Forest in Fermanagh, since he thought building such a place would be impossible. Some crew members tried to persuade him against filming there, but he insisted because the forest was unlike anything he had ever seen. In January 2021, it was reported filming had begun. The crew encountered difficulties with shooting on the first day, as it rained heavily, creating puddles of mud. Roughly 350 to 500 crew members worked on The School for Good and Evil, the majority of whom were locals. Filming wrapped at the end of July 2021.",
        "After the film wrapped, Feig began editing, with Erik Nordby as effects supervisor. The film's visual effects were provided by British companies DNEG, Framestore, and Cinesite. Feig hoped for the film's world to have a sense of realism, despite its magical aspects, which he tried to keep elemental; an example is the stymph. In the books, it is a bird made of bones that takes children to the Schools for Good and Evil. The team wanted it to be sentient while retaining its bones. They researched bird skeletons and decayed birds, studying the way the tissue and feathers stay on the bones, and the interactions of these three things. The team used computer-generated imagery to add expressions and emotions to the animatronic characters."

        "The film was originally slated for release in Christmas 2017. In December 2020, Chainani stated that the film is set to be released in 2022, with a release for the latter half of the year being scheduled later. In June 2022, a fall release of September 2022 was announced. In late July 2022, Netflix announced the film's release date as October 21, 2022. The release date was moved up by two days in late August.",
        "The School for Good and Evil had its world premiere at Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles on October 18, 2022, before it became streamable worldwide the following day. It was also released in select theaters."

    "Reception": [
        "The film was expected to generate \u00a330 million for the economy of Northern Ireland. Time listed The School for Good and Evil among the most anticipated films of 2022, while Empire named it one of the best films set to come out in 2022. Out of all of Netflix's 2022 films, Collider ranked it as the twelfth most-promising due to its cast and similarities to the Harry Potter film series. That website and Screen Rant listed it as a promising 2022 book-to film adaptation for audiences. The latter also thought the film could potentially result in similar success to that of the Harry Potter film series. Later, the same website commented: \"If done right, The School for Good and Evil can become a major breakout hit for Netflix.\u00a0... The School for Good and Evil can appeal to younger demographics and give Netflix something it might really want: Its own hit YA fantasy series.\" Time, Teen Vogue, The Daily Beast, ABC News, and Entertainment Weekly named it one of the most anticipated films of late 2022. The Deseret News listed it among Netflix's top four October films.",
        "GamesRadar+, GoldDerby, and The Cinemaholic described reviews as \"mixed\", while Time and HuffPost said they were \"mostly negative\". According to The Independent, journalists were \"quick to tear apart\" the film. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of 67 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The cast is game and the visuals are dazzling, but a deeply derivative narrative means The School for Good and Evil flunks on the storytelling front.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 30 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. Many reviewers thought The School for Good and Evil's story would work better as a television series, and they compared the film to the Harry Potter film series.",
        "In December 2022, Donald Clarke and Tara Brady of The Irish Times named The School for Good and Evil the ninth-worst film of the year, saying: \"Feig deliver[ed] something that looked no less vulgar than the average Des Moines department store window.\" Metacritic ranked it the fifteenth-worst-rated film of 2022, citing reviewers' criticisms of it as \"a campy, underdeveloped, and overstuffed Harry Potter knock-off that was a slog to sit through\".",
        "Many people had conflicting opinions on The School for Good and Evil, especially those who had read the book. The Independent stated audience responses were \"considerably kinder\" than those of critics, but still \"resolutely mixed\". Some thought the film \"did everything it set out to do\". Others found fault with the writing, such as the deviations from the book's plot, and disliked Tedros's dark hair, which is blond in the books. Viewers praised the actors, however, particularly Wylie.",
        "The School for Good and Evil was the most-viewed film on Netflix on October 20, 2022, the day after its release. According to Nielsen Media Research, during its first six days of release, it received 1.058 billion viewing minutes, placing second on the streaming chart after the television series The Watcher. In its first week, the film debuted at number one on Netflix's Top 10, with 78.83 million hours viewed. The next week, it dropped to second, behind The Good Nurse, having received 41.95 million viewing hours. In its third week, The School for Good and Evil ranked third on the Top 10 chart\u2014after Enola Holmes 2 and The Good Nurse\u2014with 19.03 million hours viewed. The film placed ninth the next week after garnering 8.85 million viewing hours. The following week, it dropped off the chart."
