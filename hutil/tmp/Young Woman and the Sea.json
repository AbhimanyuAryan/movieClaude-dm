Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films, the film stars Daisy Ridley as Gertrude Ederle, an American competitive swimmer who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel. It also stars Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Stephen Graham, Kim Bodnia, Christopher Eccleston, and Glenn Fleshler in supporting roles.\nDevelopment on the film began in 2015 after producer Jerry Bruckheimer acquired the film rights to the book and setted in up at Paramount Pictures, with Nathanson attached to write it and Lily James cast as Ederle. Paramount eventually put the project in turnaround. In 2020, it was announced it was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures, with Ridley set to portray Ederle and R\u00f8nning to direct it. Principal photography took place between May and June 2022. Originally set for release on the streaming service Disney+, Walt Disney Pictures opted to release the film theatrically after positive test screenings.\nYoung Woman and the Sea is scheduled to receive a limited theatrical release by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on May 31, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nYoung Woman and the Sea tells the story of Gertrude Ederle, an American swimming champion, who first won a gold medal at the 1924 Olympic Games. In 1926, Ederle became the first woman to swim 21 miles across the English Channel.[1]\n\nCast[edit]\nDaisy Ridley as Gertrude \"Trudy\" Ederle: An American competition swimmer and Olympic champion.[2]\nTilda Cobham-Hervey as Margaret \"Meg\" Ederle: Gertrude's sister.[3]\nStephen Graham as Bill: A sailor tracking down Gertrude's progress.[3]\nKim Bodnia as Henry Ederle: Gertrude's father.\nChristopher Eccleston as Jabez Wolffe: Gertrude's trainer.[4]\nGlenn Fleshler as James Sullivan\nJeanette Hain as Gertrude Anna Ederle: Gertrude's mother.[5]\nSian Clifford as Charlotte: Gertrude's swimming trainer.\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn November 2015, it was announced that Jerry Bruckheimer had acquired the rights to the 2009 non-fiction book Young Woman and the Sea: How Trudy Ederle Conquered the English Channel and Inspired the World by Glenn Stout for Paramount Pictures, hiring Jeff Nathanson to write the script for the film,[6] and Lily James cast to play Gertrude Ederle.[6] In December 2020, it was reported that the film was in development at Walt Disney Pictures, with the company eyeing a Disney+ release, after Paramount put it in turnaround. Production was overseen by Jerry Bruckheimer under his Jerry Bruckheimer Films banner, and Chad Oman for Disney.[2]\n\nCasting[edit]\nLily James was originally cast in the titular role of Gertrude Ederle, until the film lay in development hell.[6] With the film's announcement in December 2020, Daisy Ridley was cast in the titular role instead.[2] In March 2022, Tilda Cobham-Hervey joined the cast of the film playing Margaret Ederle, along with Stephen Graham in an undisclosed role.[3] In May 2022, Christopher Eccleston joined the cast in an undisclosed role.[4]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began by early May 2022, and wrapped on June 18, 2022.[4][7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nYoung Woman and the Sea was scheduled to debut on Disney+.[2] In January 2024, following positive test screenings and the box office success of the Amazon MGM Studios sports drama The Boys in the Boat (2023), a theatrical release was considered as a possible way to tie-in with the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics in France, with a potential release date of May 31, 2024. The following month, it was officially moved to theatrical for a limited release.[5]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nFirst look images from the film were released exclusively by People on March 6, 2024.[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Oddo, Marco Vito (May 4, 2022). \"Christopher Eccleston Boards 'Young Woman and the Sea' Biopic With Daisy Ridley\".
