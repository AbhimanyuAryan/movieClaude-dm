In December 2020, it was reported that the film was in development at Walt Disney Pictures, with the company eyeing a Disney+ release, after Paramount put it in turnaround. Production was overseen by Jerry Bruckheimer under his Jerry Bruckheimer Films banner, and Chad Oman for Disney.",

In March 2022, Tilda Cobham-Hervey joined the cast of the film playing Margaret Ederle, along with Stephen Graham in an undisclosed role. In May 2022, Christopher Eccleston joined the cast in an undisclosed role.",
