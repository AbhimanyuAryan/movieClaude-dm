    "Reception": [
        "Waldemar Dalenogare Neto evaluated it with a score of 1/10 and said that \"whoever sees it, does not believe it: The Asylum managed to overcome itself (...) I already knew it was a bad movie, the trailer is already a disgrace (...) the bad taste when dealing with a tragedy (on the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic) (...) It's not a horror movie, as much as the title may lead you to this idea, here you actually have a big joke at the cost of extremely poor graphical effects and a completely lost cast.\"",
        "In his review in Paste, Matt Donato rated it 4/10 saying that \"while Netflix harbors Oscar aspirations for its originals, Tubi appears content being the streaming equivalent of SYFY after midnight. (...) I\u2019ve seen worse films this year than Titanic 666, but also too many better examples (...) Against all odds, Titanic 666 is too dramatic and straight-faced for its own good.\"",
        "On Crooked Marquee, Josh Bell rated it a \"C\u2212\" saying that \"is a slow, dull haunted-ship story that takes far too long to get to its meager terrors. Lydia Hearst finds the right campy tone as a descendant of one of the original Titanic victims who summons their spirits to curse this shameless exploitation of their memories, and AnnaLynne McCord is fun to watch as a narcissistic influencer who exits the movie too early. But the ghosts themselves are tame, poorly rendered apparitions, and the valiant, self-sacrificing captain (Keesha Sharp) makes for a weak protagonist as the voyage predictably devolves into chaos.\""
