        "In a small town, Baron is a simple-minded yet kind-hearted young man, who finds himself incarcerated. Sharing his cell is Otis, an experienced escape artist reluctant to assist Baron in escaping. Baron's offer of $250,000 for a successful escape changes Otis's mind. When questioned about the money, Baron recounts his life's story, beginning with his devotion to his terminally ill mother, Eda, who adored Moon Pies, and his subsequent job loss due to his refusal to conform to a dress code.",
        "Baron's life takes a pivotal turn when he meets Marmalade, a woman haunted by a traumatic childhood in foster care. Their relationship deepens, marked by shared vulnerabilities and a desperate plan to secure their future through a bank robbery, spurred by the dire need for Eda\u2019s medication. The plan derails when Marmalade impulsively attempts a robbery, leading to a tragic series of events culminating in Eda\u2019s death under mysterious circumstances.",
        "As Baron pours out his heart, Otis reveals his own painful connection to a sick mother in Jamaica, creating an unexpected bond between them. Their camaraderie is interrupted by a prison riot, during which Otis's true identity as an undercover FBI agent targeting Marmalade, a notorious bank robber, is unveiled. Otis proposes a faux escape to ensnare Marmalade, with the reluctant agreement of his team.",
        "Resuming his tale, Baron explains the reluctant continuation of the robbery plan, driven by Marmalade\u2019s claimed pregnancy. The heist yields unexpected wealth but also revelations and separation. As Baron cleans the getaway car, he discovers his mother\u2019s medication, leading to a heart-wrenching realization about Marmalade\u2019s manipulations.",
        "Baron, attempting to reunite with Marmalade, eludes the FBI in a daring escape, only to unveil layers of deception. His final act of transformation and a trail of clues lead Otis to a shocking revelation: Baron himself was the mastermind behind the heist, and Marmalade, a figment of his complex deception.",
        "The narrative closes with Baron, now revealed as a caring doctor in a nursing home, tenderly attending to his mother, Eda. In a poignant letter to Otis, Baron reflects on life\u2019s forward momentum and the importance of caring for one\u2019s loved ones, leaving Otis with a ticket to Jamaica and a message of farewell."
