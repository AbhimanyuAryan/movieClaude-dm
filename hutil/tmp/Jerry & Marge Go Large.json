        "In the small town of Evart, Michigan, Jerry and Marge Selbee live a quiet life. Jerry, recently retired after forty-two years, spends his days tinkering with his new motorboat. But an accidental crash at the lake turns his attention elsewhere.",
        "One day, while at the local gas station, Jerry overhears a conversation about the WinFall lottery's rolldown weeks. A mathematician at heart, he quickly figures out a statistical loophole. He realizes that during rolldowns, buying a large number of tickets almost guarantees a win. Marge, bored in retirement immediately grabs a hold and says \"I'm in,\" when she learns of the lottery winnings.",
        "They start small, but Marge's encouragement leads Jerry to go all in. They empty their savings, and the risk pays off - their $8,000 investment turns into $15,000. Excited by their success, they can't keep it a secret for long.",
        "When WinFall closes in Michigan, the Selbees don't give up. Marge organizes a 10-hour road trip to Massachusetts, where the lottery is still active. They spend days at a small liquor store, printing ticket after ticket, doubling their money once again.",
        "Back in Evart, they decide to share their secret. They create GS Investment Strategies, allowing their friends and neighbors to invest. The investment reinvigorates the town. Old businesses reopen, and the local Jazz Fest venue is restored, all thanks to the lottery winnings.",
        "But their success attracts unwanted attention. A group of Harvard students, led by Tyler, have also discovered the loophole. They confront Jerry and Marge, arrogantly suggesting they combine forces. The Selbees refuse, standing firm in their methods and morals.",
        "As tensions rise, Tyler threatens Jerry, demanding he stop playing WinFall. Jerry almost gives in, but the support of his son and the community strengthens his resolve. They won't be bullied out of their endeavor.",
        "The story reaches its peak when Jerry confronts Tyler in Massachusetts, exposing his selfish tactics. In a final twist, the Massachusetts State Lottery, pressured by growing media attention, shuts down WinFall.",
        "Despite the end of their lottery journey, Jerry and Marge return to Evart as heroes. Their adventure not only brought wealth but also revived the spirit of their small town."
