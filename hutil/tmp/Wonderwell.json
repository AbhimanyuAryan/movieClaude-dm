        "Principal photography took place in Tuscany and in Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome, Italy between October 2016 and February 2017. Serval scenes were shot in ancient Etruscan towns San Gimigniano and Volterra. Veteran producer Fred Roos, known for his lifelong collaboration with Francis Ford Coppola, brought Fisher, Ora and a number of the key creative team to the project. Fisher, who passed away in late 2016, just six weeks after wrapping her scenes, leads the cast alongside British singer and actress Rita Ora and newcomer Kiera Milward.",
        "The film's score, composed by William Ross, was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The late Angelo Badalamenti, known for his collaborations with David Lynch on projects including Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive, composed the film's \"Violet\u2019s Theme\". One of the film's central characters, The Creature, was inspired by Cel, the Etruscan goddess of the Mother Earth and designed by art director Daniele Auber, known for his works for Terry Gilliam and Luc Besson.",
        "Due to interruptions with funding, post-production was extended until early 2020, and then, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, all work on the almost finished film was suspended for several months."

        "Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, deeming it \"a rather limp, confusing little fantasy that could have been left gathering even more dust on the shelf without anyone needing to know\".",
        "Independent blogger Mike Haberfelner called Wonderwell \"a visually stunning film, full of impressive set designs\", \"a mix of coming-of-age story, dark fairy tale and thriller, in which well fleshed-out characters are embodied by a relatable ensemble cast, making this a pretty cool and pretty unusual ride.\"",
        "WORLDFILMGEEK portal said that \u201cWonderwell is a terrific and emotionally charged fantasy film that closes the book of a Hollywood icon. Carrie Fisher\u2019s final performance is a wonderful delight to see as someone who not only loves the work but brings that iconic off-screen personality to the screens. We still miss Carrie Fisher, but there couldn\u2019t be a better sendoff than this film.\u201d"
