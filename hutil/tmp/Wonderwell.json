It stars Carrie Fisher (in her final film role before her death in 2016), Rita Ora, Kiera Milward, and Nell Tiger Free.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nAt 12 years old, Violet (Kiera Milward) lives in Italy with her parents (Lloyd Owen and Megan Dodds) and her beautiful older sister Savannah (Nell Tiger Free). When she is selected to be the face of world-renowned designer Yana\u2019s (Rita Ora) fashion label, the family travels to an enchanting medieval village for her first photo shoot. Neglected and bored, Violet wanders from the ancient Tuscan town into a nearby forest where she meets the enigmatic Hazel (Carrie Fisher), who may be the fabled witch of the woods Violet was warned about by Yana\u2019s beleaguered stepson, Daniele (Sebastian Croft). Guided by Hazel to a mysterious portal, Violet is offered a glimpse of what her future might hold, but like the transition from childhood to womanhood, it may be a journey of no return. \n\nCast[edit]\nCarrie Fisher as Hazel\nRita Ora as Yana\nKiera Milward as Violet\nNell Tiger Free as Savannah\nSebastian Croft as Daniele\nVincent Spano as Franco\nMegan Dodds as Chlo\nLloyd Owen as Adam\nNiccolo Besio as Enrico\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography took place in Tuscany and in Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome, Italy between October 2016 and February 2017. Serval scenes were shot in ancient Etruscan towns San Gimigniano and Volterra. Veteran producer Fred Roos, known for his lifelong collaboration with Francis Ford Coppola, brought Fisher, Ora and a number of the key creative team to the project. Fisher, who passed away in late 2016,[1][2] just six weeks after wrapping her scenes, leads the cast alongside British singer and actress Rita Ora[3] and newcomer Kiera Milward.[4]\nThe film's score, composed by William Ross, was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The late Angelo Badalamenti, known for his collaborations with David Lynch on projects including Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive, composed the film's \"Violet\u2019s Theme\". One of the film's central characters, The Creature, was inspired by Cel, the Etruscan goddess of the Mother Earth and designed by art director Daniele Auber, known for his works for Terry Gilliam and Luc Besson.\nDue to interruptions with funding, post-production was extended until early 2020, and then, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, all work on the almost finished film was suspended for several months.\n\nRelease[edit]\nOn June 14, 2023, Deadline Hollywood has announced that Vertical acquired North American, UK, and Ireland rights to the film and published an announcement of the film's release, and on June 16, 2023, it published the official theatrical poster and first official trailer. The film had a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and also appeared on all online platforms on June 23, 2023.[5]\nWonderwell was also released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Slovakia and the Benelux countries on November 24, 2023 by Splendid Film.\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 38% of 8 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.3/10.[6]\nThe release of the last Carrie Fisher film was welcomed with enthusiasm by her fans and by fans of the fantasy genre.[7]\nBenjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, deeming it \"a rather limp, confusing little fantasy that could have been left gathering even more dust on the shelf without anyone needing to know\".[8]\nIndependent blogger Mike Haberfelner called Wonderwell \"a visually stunning film, full of impressive set designs\", \"a mix of coming-of-age story, dark fairy tale and thriller, in which well fleshed-out characters are embodied by a relatable ensemble cast, making this a pretty cool and pretty unusual ride.\"[9]\nWORLDFILMGEEK portal said that \u201cWonderwell is a terrific and emotionally charged fantasy film that closes the book of a Hollywood icon. Carrie Fisher\u2019s final performance is a wonderful delight to see as someone who not only loves the work but brings that iconic off-screen personality to the screens. We still miss Carrie Fisher, but there couldn\u2019t be a better sendoff than this film.\u201d[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Carrie Fisher's 'magical' final film gets release date 7 years after death\". 2023-06-14.
