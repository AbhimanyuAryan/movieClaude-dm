        "Mack writes a feature about New Yorkers\u2019 favorite sports memories, asking both Adam and Nick to read a draft. While Adam immediately reads and loves the piece, Nick is slow to get to it while working on his latest manuscript. At a gala event where Nick is receiving a humanitarian award from UNICEF, Mack reveals that Nick has rewritten her piece entirely rather than giving feedback. Adam becomes upset at Nick\u2019s treatment of her and storms off. Mack and Nick fight about the piece that night, where Nick reveals that her job could be in jeopardy in the next round of layoffs at the paper. The two break up, and Mack submits her version of the story, which her editor loves, assigning her to work a Yankees game for the first time.",

After confronting her, she reveals that she broke up with Adam after their brunch, unbeknownst to the group.

Adam avoids contact with Mack, but agrees to help Ashley surprise Little - who she has started dating - with tickets to the game that Mack is working. To Adam\u2019s surprise, he is actually the target of the play: letting Mack confess her love outside the stadium. The two share a kiss before Mack runs off to work the game."
