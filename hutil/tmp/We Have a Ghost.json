Ernest S. identifies the ghost as Randy. He claims that after Randy's wife died, Randy left his daughter June with Ernest S. and disappeared. The CIA arrive in Oklahoma and capture Randy.",
        "Randy has a flashback of being killed by Ernest S., and Dr. Monroe frees Randy. Meanwhile, Ernest S. arrives at the house to kill Kevin, believing Kevin is avenging Randy's murder.

        "Production of We Have a Ghost was announced in July 2021, with Christopher Landon writing and directing, and Geoff Manaugh, on whose short story it was based, as executive producer. The cast included Anthony Mackie, David Harbour, Jahi Winston, Tig Notaro, Jennifer Coolidge, Erica Ash, Niles Fitch, Isabella Russo, Faith Ford and Steve Coulter.  Harbour was Landon's first choice for the role of Ernest; as he told Entertainment Weekly: \"I knew that the role was incredibly challenging because there's no dialog, so he just has to do so much with so little. We had a meeting, and he told me he was terrified of doing it, which I thought was great because it shows that he was feeling vulnerable and intrigued and excited. By the end of our meeting, I think we both felt really strongly that it was a good match\".",
        "Principal photography began in August 2021 in Donaldsonville and New Orleans. A few weeks into filming, production was halted because of the landfall of Hurricane Ida in Louisiana. Production resumed October to finish filming scenes in the Ascension Parish west bank city."
