    "Plot": [
        "Randolph \"Randy\" Bradley is a fast food worker in rural Louisiana who is slated to be promoted to manager yet is still bullied by other employees. After Benson, his co-worker, sees Randy being bullied by another employee, he suddenly snaps and shoots all the workers in the building save for Randy. Randy reluctantly helps Benson clean the bloody scene and they place the bodies in the freezer.",
        "The duo drive to a nearby diner, where Randy asks why Benson committed the shooting spree. Benson's response is to insult their waitress, saying that she hasn\u2019t done anything remarkable in her life. Benson takes Randy to Benson's mother's house to give her some food and cigarettes. When Randy goes to get a phone for his mom, Benson pins him against the wall. They go back to Benson's car, where Benson says that he has to hurt Randy to make him learn and sets up a rule that he does only what is necessary for Randy.",
        "They head to a mall to talk to Randy\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Lisa. She explains that the reason for their breakup was because of Randy's apathy and they reconcile. Randy explains to Benson that he had been held back in second grade due to an incident with his teacher, Mrs. Beard, in which he flung an eraser into her eye after being angry, and it ruined both their lives; Mrs. Beard was mocked by people, and Randy decided to isolate all of his feelings after the incident for fear of what his emotions can do to others.",
        "Benson and Randy then go to the school where Mrs. Beard worked, to get her home address, whilst Benson plans to kill her. Outside, Benson spots the vice principal. Benson viciously beats him, but Randy stops the beating because of the rule Benson set for Randy.",
        "At Mrs. Beard's house, Randy learns that she does not blame him for the accident. Mrs. Beard answers the phone, and she is told about the vice principal's earlier beating. Benson pulls a gun on Mrs. Beard, but Randy tells Benson not to kill her, at which point Benson takes Mrs. Beard hostage and plans on driving out the city.",
        "The three return to the diner from earlier and while in the restroom, Randy calls the police. They are confronted by the waitress from earlier. Still angered by Benson\u2019s insult, she berates him until Benson shoots her in the leg. Randy tries to stop Benson, and they hear the sound of police sirens. Angered and terrified, Benson shoots Randy in the shoulder but quickly feels remorse. Saddened by Randy's betrayal, Benson walks outside and commits suicide by cop. Sometime later, Randy plays with Mrs. Beard's daughter as she arrives home and he is finally happy, showing he has control over his own life."
