It stars Ben Kingsley, Harriet Sansom Harris, Zo\u00eb Winters, Jade Quon, and Jane Curtin.[4]\nThe film was theatrically released in North America (US, limited release in Canada) in August 2023, in Ireland and the UK on 29 December 2023, and in Germany on 1 February 2024.[5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMilton Robinson is a 79-year-old widower living on his own. He frequently attends city council meetings and receives help from his daughter. One day, an UFO lands in his backyard and a small humanoid alien crawls out of it. Milton attempts to get help by calling the police and his daughter, and informing the city council. However, all of those people believe Milton's claim is further proof of his senility.\nMilton treats the alien as a house guest and discovers the alien will only eat apples. Milton's acquaintance, Sandy, visits Milton and discovers the alien. Sandy tells Milton to not tell anyone about the alien. Joyce, another elderly woman, also discovers the alien. Sandy names the alien \"Jules\". Jules begins repairing the spaceship but does not appear to be making quick progress. Milton's daughter, Denise, hears about her father's antics and schedules him for a mental evaluation, where Milton and Denise are told that Milton's faculties are quickly diminishing and that he should consider assisted living. This upsets Milton, and he angrily leaves.\nSandy, who is attempting to start a program to connect with the town's young citizens, is robbed by a young man she invites to her house. After Sandy states that she will call the police, the man tackles and attempts to strangle her; however, Jules receives a vision of the events and telepathically causes the man's head to explode. This raises the suspicion of the NSA, since they are conducting an ongoing search for the crashed spaceship. Milton, Sandy, and Joyce realize that Jules needs dead cats to power the spaceship, so Milton and Sandy go out to find some, but Milton continues to be troubled by thoughts of his declining faculties. Meanwhile, they are unknowingly followed by police, who observe their strange activities. With the addition of Joyce's deaf and blind cat, they are able to repair the spaceship. Jules invites the three senior citizens to travel in the spaceship. Milton considers accepting. He reconsiders after a phone call with his daughter. When the NSA kicks down Milton's door, he, Sandy, and Joyce hurriedly escape in the UFO. Jules drops them off at another location on Earth and they part ways.\nSome time later, Jules visits Milton again.\n\nCast[edit]\nBen Kingsley as Milton[6]\nJane Curtin as Joyce[7]\nHarriet Sansom Harris as Sandy[7]\nZo\u00eb Winters as Denise,[7] Milton's daughter\nJade Quon as Jules, the alien\nAndy Daly as Aaron Campbell\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in New Jersey on September 10, 2021,[8][9] and continued in Boonton, New Jersey and Chatham, New Jersey.[10]  The film entered post-production in February 2022.[11]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the Sonoma International Film Festival on March 22, 2023.[12] In April 2023, Bleecker Street acquired North American distribution rights to the film, setting it for a theatrical release on August 11, 2023.[13]\nJules was released for digital platforms on September 12, 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on October 10, 2023.[14]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 110 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.
