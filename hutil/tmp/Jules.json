    "Plot": [
        "Milton Robinson is a 79-year-old widower living on his own. He frequently attends city council meetings and receives help from his daughter. One day, an UFO lands in his backyard and a small humanoid alien crawls out of it. Milton attempts to get help by calling the police and his daughter, and informing the city council. However, all of those people believe Milton's claim is further proof of his senility.",
        "Milton treats the alien as a house guest and discovers the alien will only eat apples. Milton's acquaintance, Sandy, visits Milton and discovers the alien. Sandy tells Milton to not tell anyone about the alien. Joyce, another elderly woman, also discovers the alien. Sandy names the alien \"Jules\". Jules begins repairing the spaceship but does not appear to be making quick progress. Milton's daughter, Denise, hears about her father's antics and schedules him for a mental evaluation, where Milton and Denise are told that Milton's faculties are quickly diminishing and that he should consider assisted living. This upsets Milton, and he angrily leaves.",
        "Sandy, who is attempting to start a program to connect with the town's young citizens, is robbed by a young man she invites to her house. After Sandy states that she will call the police, the man tackles and attempts to strangle her; however, Jules receives a vision of the events and telepathically causes the man's head to explode. This raises the suspicion of the NSA, since they are conducting an ongoing search for the crashed spaceship. Milton, Sandy, and Joyce realize that Jules needs dead cats to power the spaceship, so Milton and Sandy go out to find some, but Milton continues to be troubled by thoughts of his declining faculties. Meanwhile, they are unknowingly followed by police, who observe their strange activities. With the addition of Joyce's deaf and blind cat, they are able to repair the spaceship. Jules invites the three senior citizens to travel in the spaceship. Milton considers accepting. He reconsiders after a phone call with his daughter. When the NSA kicks down Milton's door, he, Sandy, and Joyce hurriedly escape in the UFO. Jules drops them off at another location on Earth and they part ways.",
        "Some time later, Jules visits Milton again."
