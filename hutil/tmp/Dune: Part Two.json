    "Plot": [
        "Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \"Outer World\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.",
        "Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by drinking the Water of Life: a poison fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.",
        "Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and taking part in raids against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names \"Usul\" and \"Muad'Dib\". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage.",
        "Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays North fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen\u2014including Sietch Tabr\u2014forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has a clearer vision of the past, present, and future. He sees an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and learns that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures.",
        "The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar to a death duel for leadership. He refuses, instead galvanizing the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar forces. Paul murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.",
        "Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring, thus surrendering. After the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm."

        "Anya Taylor-Joy makes an uncredited cameo appearance as Alia Atreides, Paul's unborn sister who appears in his visions as well as communicating to Jessica while in her womb. Babs Olusanmokun and Roger Yuan reprise their roles from the first film as Jamis and Lieutenant Lanville, respectively. Stephen McKinley Henderson filmed scenes reprising his role as Thufir Hawat, while Tim Blake Nelson filmed scenes as an undisclosed character, but their scenes were not included in the final cut. Both were given a \"Special Thanks\" credit by Villeneuve."

    "Production": [
        "By November 2016, Legendary Pictures had obtained the film and TV rights for the Dune franchise, based on the eponymous 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Mary Parent began discussing with Denis Villeneuve about directing a film adaptation, quickly hiring him after realizing his passion for Dune. By February 2018, Villeneuve was confirmed to be hired as director, and intended to adapt the novel as a two-part film series. Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaption of Stephen King's It in 2017 and 2019. In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed to be serving as the film's editor. Other crew included Brad Riker as supervising art director, Patrice Vermette as production designer, Paul Lambert as visual effects supervisor, Gerd Nefzer as special effects supervisor, and Thomas Struthers as stunt coordinator. Dune: Part Two was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant. Legendary CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel, adding that \"there's a logical place to stop the [first] movie before the book is over\".",
        "In December 2020, Villeneuve stated that due to Warner Bros.' plan to release the film in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously, the first film could underperform financially, resulting in cancellation of the planned sequel. In an IMAX screening of the first film's first ten minutes, the title logo read Dune: Part One, lending credence to plans for the sequel. By August 2021, Villeneuve spoke more confidently about the chances of a sequel film, iterating his excitement to work with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya again, while stating Chani would have a bigger role in the sequel. Warner Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel would be greenlit as long as the film performed well on HBO Max. Just days prior to the first film's release, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, \"Will we have a sequel to Dune? If you watch the movie you see how it ends. I think you pretty much know the answer to that.\"",
        "On October 26, 2021, Legendary officially greenlit Dune: Part Two, with a spokesperson for the company stating, \"We would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Here's to more Dune.\" Production work had occurred back-to-back with the first film, as Villeneuve and his wife Lapointe immediately took a flight to Budapest in order to begin pre-production work. A key point of negotiation prior to greenlighting the sequel was assuring that the sequel would have an exclusive window where it would only be shown theatrically, with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window before it would be available through other channels. Villeneuve said this theatrical exclusivity was a \"non-negotiable condition\", and that \"the theatrical experience is at the very heart of the cinematic language for me\". With Dune: Part Two being greenlit, Villeneuve said that his primary concern was to complete the filming as soon as possible, with the earliest he expected to start in the last quarter of 2022. However, he noted that production would be expedited by the work already done for the first film.",
        "Eric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in April 2017 for the Dune films, and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve. Game of Thrones language creator David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film in April 2019. Villeneuve and Peterson had created the Chakobsa language, which was used by actors on set. In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as show-runner for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune: Part Two. In June 2020, Greig Fraser said, \"It's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. It's a fully standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see it\". Between the release of Dune and the confirmation of Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve started working the script in a way that production could begin immediately once the film was greenlit. By February 2021, Roth created a full treatment for the sequel, with writing beginning that August. He confirmed that Feyd-Rautha would appear in the film, and stated he will be a \"very important character\". In March 2022, Villeneuve had mostly finished writing the screenplay. Craig Mazin and Roth wrote additional literary material for the film.",
        "Villeneuve stated that the film would continue directly from the first, and specifically described it as being the \"second part\". He described the film as being an \"epic war movie\", adding that while the first film was more \"contemplative\", the second would feature more action. Villeneuve sought to anchor the movie to the characters, primarily Paul and Chani. With the two featured in an \"epic love story\" between them, Villeneuve described them as the \"epicenter of the story\". Zendaya initially found difficulty in creating dialogue, commenting that \"It was funny trying to figure out in this futuristic space talk, like, how do they flirt?\" Chalamet also added that Paul would be heavily influenced by Chani, serving as his \"moral compass\". Additionally, Paul becomes deeply embedded in Fremen culture, developing a closer bond with Stilgar, who becomes his surrogate father figure and mentor, while tensions emerge between Chani and Lady Jessica, as Chani is aware that Jessica's schemes negatively impact the Fremen. The script ultimately conveys Chani as a nonbeliever of the prophecy and intended for its structure to first convey their romantic relationship from Paul's perspective, and eventually pivot to Chani's perspective as the audience realizes Paul's desire for power and insidious nature. He focused on Herbert's original intention to depict Paul as an antihero in Dune to becoming an eventual villain, and wrote the script with that in mind while also considering his future plans regarding Dune Messiah, particularly by modifying Chani's characterization as he felt that she eventually \"disappeared in Paul's shadows\" in the book. Feeling he had the \"benefit of time\" in doing so, Villeneuve decided to use all the elements of Paul's character arc and \"play them a bit differently\" in order to establish his eventual transformation into a villainous figure and becoming \"what he was trying to fight against\". He expanded the role of Chani and Lady Jessica from the novel, and interpreted Chani as being a critique of power. When envisioning the sandworm sequence, Villeneuve primarily relied upon his own drawings and storyboards, as he felt the book did not contain adequate descriptions. He later cited it as being one of his favorite scenes in the film. When writing Paul's character arc, he considered Paul as transforming from a \"humble\" figure to a \"dark messianic figure\", and took inspiration from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira (1988) when designing the storyboards. Villeneuve felt the film's ending was more \"tragic\" than that of the book, feeling that it adequately resolved Paul's storyline across the Dune films while setting up his character arc for a potential third film based on Dune Messiah (1969).",
        "Following the first film, Baron Harkonnen is described as being heavily debilitated and reliant on being submerged in fluids, while focusing on choosing an heir: Glossu Rabban or Feyd-Rautha, both his nephews. Rabban was regarded as being a bad strategist, while Feyd-Rautha is shown to be clever and charismatic. Actor Austin Butler felt Feyd-Rautha's character served as \"flip sides of the same coin\" to Paul, as both had been involved in the Bene Gesserit's genetic breeding program; Butler opined Feyd-Rautha's upbringing on Giedi Prime and self-care for his body explained his arrogance. Meanwhile, Villeneuve noted his psychopathic personality and brutality similar to that of an animal contrasted his \"code of honors\" and reverence for fighters. Lady Jessica is also heavily traumatized by the death of Duke Leto, being compared to Paul as a \"survivor\" and strategizing to realize the ambitions of the Bene Gesserit, who aim to fulfill their prophecy to maximize human potential, disregarding morality and ethics. There is also additional focus on the political aspect, with Princess Irulan fearing that her father, Emperor Shaddam IV, will lose his throne due to his loss of influence over warring factions. During the sequence of Paul's consumption of the Water of Life, Villeneuve deliberately altered the timeframe to depict an adult Alia for a dramatic effect and to highlight Alia's unique birth. He and Spaihts decided to \"compress\" the time for both the sequence and Lady Jessica's pregnancy in order to establish more narrative tension. He also added that Lady Jessica's conversations with an embryonic Alia was unique as he felt it was \"fresh and original to have a character who is powerful and still a pregnant woman\" while also conveying how others perceive Alia as an \"abomination\". Like Chani and Lady Jessica, Villeneuve further developed Princess Irulan's character and motivations from the novel, with actress Florence Pugh noting her reserved nature and intelligence.",
        "In March 2022, Pugh and Butler were reported to be in talks to star in the film as Princess Irulan and Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha, respectively. Butler was offered the role while having coffee with Villeneuve, without needing to audition. He trained for four months in Budapest, using a fitness regimen made by an ex-Navy SEALs member. Villeneuve described his performance as being a \"cross between a psychopath killer, an Olympic sword master, a snake, and Mick Jagger\" while Butler researched past cultures he felt \"bred brutality\" and took inspiration from various animals including sharks and snakes. Butler also said that he drew inspiration from Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger for his performance. He imitated Skarsg\u00e5rd's voice as the Baron, as he felt that Feyd would be influenced by the Baron due to growing up with him. In May, Christopher Walken joined the cast as Shaddam IV. In June, L\u00e9a Seydoux entered negotiations to join the cast as Lady Margot Fenring. In July, Souheila Yacoub joined the cast as Shishakli. In January 2023, Tim Blake Nelson was added to the cast in an undisclosed role. Attending the film's London premiere in February 2024, Anya Taylor-Joy confirmed that she had been cast in the film. Villeneuve was surprised that her role had been kept a secret for that long, noting it required \"so much work to keep that secret\". Her role had been revealed in a casting credit list for the film on Letterboxd.",
        "Pre-shooting had commenced on July 4, 2022, at the Brion tomb in Altivole, Italy for two days. Principal photography was set to begin on July 21 in Budapest, Hungary, but began earlier on July 18. The film was entirely shot using Arri Alexa LF digital cameras, with new filming locations and sets being used \"to avoid repetition\". By October 2022, Chalamet had taken a break from filming in order to attend the premiere of Bones and All (2022). The production team managed to shoot during the partial solar eclipse of October 25, and used the footage for the opening fight scene between Harkonnen and Fremen soldiers. By the next month, production moved to Abu Dhabi, with Pugh also finishing her scenes in the same month. Certain scenes set at dawn had to be filmed across three days to take advantage of the golden hour. A special unit of production filmed scenes with Taylor-Joy in Namibia, the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa. Filming wrapped on December 12, 2022. Due to the delays, Villeneuve was able to make a film transfer for projection using the IMAX 70 mm and conventional 70 mm film formats.",
        "Pugh delivered Princess Irulan's opening narration during her first day of filming and for overall production. Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser had filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator sequence with specially designed black-and-white infrared cameras. They wanted the Harkonnens to cheer and stomp rather than applaud, and designed over 30 sections for spectators in the arena. Butler spent his first week on set filming the scene, during which the set had very high temperatures that caused some people to faint. He also improvised his kiss scene with the Baron. For romantic scenes between Paul and Chani, the scenes primarily filmed in remote locations in Jordan during the golden hour. The scenes were often filmed as quickly as possible, with only a one-hour window being available. The scene of Paul's sandworm ride was filmed practically on a production unit separate from the main one, being led by producer Tanya Lapointe and a special team. Chalamet filmed his scenes on a platform meant to imitate a portion of the sandworm, with gripping devices serving as the reference for the Fremen hooks. An industrial fan blew sand on set to emulate the desert climate. Chalamet estimated the scene took over three months to film, with individual shoots occurring over a span of 20\u201330 minutes. As the actual sandworm was not built and there were no reference shots, the production team designed a small portion of the worm on set and the actors had to physically visualize and imitate riding the sandworm. Butler and Chalamet had separately trained with a Kali instructor in Los Angeles for the climactic battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. They were excited to do the scene, and immediately began practicing once they later met in Budapest. They performed the scene by themselves, including for wide camera shots, while Chalamet delivers the monologue entirely in Chakobsa. Ferguson had cited Lady Jessica undergoing the Reverend Mother process as her favorite scene, working with contortionists for the scene and comparing it to an Exorcist film."

It was later postponed by over four months to March 15, 2024, due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. After the strikes were resolved, the film moved once more up two weeks to March 1, 2024.",
        "Following the success of Oppenheimer (2023) in the format, Dune: Part Two was released in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm format to twelve venues worldwide, and in standard 5-perforation 70mm format to 38 venues worldwide.",
        "A red carpet event was hosted in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on February 6, 2024. Dune: Part Two's world premiere was held at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on February 15.",
        "On January 16, 2024, the film was shown to a dying man in a palliative care home in the Canadian city of Saguenay, in Denis Villeneuve's native province of Quebec. The man had expressed a wish to see Dune: Part Two before his death. Jos\u00e9e Gagnon, the cofounder of a company aiming to accompany people at the end of life, relayed his wish to Villeneuve and Tanya Lapointe, his partner and one of the film's producers, through a viral call-out on Facebook. According to Gagnon, Villeneuve and Lapointe \"were very touched\". The pair initially offered to invite the man to see Dune: Part Two in Los Angeles or Montreal, but since he was too weak to travel, Villeneuve eventually decided to send one of his assistants directly to Saguenay with his private laptop. The film was screened in a room of the care facility, where everyone was required to hand in their cellphones and sign waivers. The man was in too much pain to watch the entire film and stopped halfway through. He eventually died on January 25. This act, which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to as the actual \"world premiere\" of the film, was publicly disclosed after its theatrical release.",

        "Outside the US and Canada, the film grossed $100.02 million in its opening weekend from 71 markets. In its second weekend, the sci-fi epic added $81 million from 72 international markets, including a $20 million opening in China.

        "The film \"largely received rave reviews from critics\", and was praised for its visual effects and cast performances. Some reviews considered it one of the best science fiction films of all time. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 413 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Visually thrilling and narratively epic, Dune: Part Two continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 94% overall positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded the film four stars out of five and praised its visuals: \"Dune's loose-endedness is one of its best qualities: finding out what happens is secondary to just seeing it unfold.\" Peter Bradshaw, chief film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film four stars out of five, writing \"Denis Villeneuve's monumental adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It's impossible to imagine anyone doing it better.\" Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three stars out of four, praising the technical and narrative aspects, saying, \"Even as we marvel at the stunning and immersive and Oscar-level cinematography, editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two, we're reminded at every turn that this is an absolutely bat-bleep [sic] crazy story.\"",
        "Filmmaker Steven Spielberg praised the film, calling it \"one of the most brilliant science fiction films I have ever seen,\" while further noting that \"it's also filled with deeply, deeply drawn characters ... Yet the dialogue is very sparse when you look at it proportionately to the running time of the film. It's such cinema. The shots are so painterly, yet there's not an angle or single setup that's pretentious.\"",
        "Other reviews were more mixed in their judgement. In The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarkye praised the film's technical aspects and performances, but found it failed to fully adapt the book's nuance on themes such as imperialism. Nicholas Barber wrote for the BBC that the film is \"one of the most jaw-droppingly weird pieces of art-house psychedelia ever to come from a major studio\", finding the film's grand scale made up for its issues. At the more negative end, Noah Berlatsky writing for CNN judged that the film had failed to \"present an effective anti-colonial vision\" by still being centred around Paul's destiny despite an increased voice of opposition from Chani.",
        "Some commentators have criticised the film for failing to adequately deal with the original book's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) influences or otherwise incorporate enough representation from the region. Furvah Shah, writing for the UK edition of Cosmopolitan, said she \"felt frustrated as a Muslim viewer\", criticising the film for a lack of MENA casting amongst the leads despite the use of the region's culture and superficial use of Islam. The New Arab's Hannah Flint also criticized the use of Arab and Islamic cultural items and lack of MENA casting, though did praise that of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souheila Yacoub as a \"win for Arab representation\". Steven D. Greydanus, in U.S. Catholic, gives a contrasting view of the film's religious inspirations, noting that the film draws from a number of Abrahamic religions for the purpose of critiquing faith itself, while also noting the \"spiritualization of ecological concerns\" through the Fremen.",
        "The trailer for Dune: Part Two received nominations for Best Fantasy Adventure and the Don LaFontaine Award for Best Voice Over at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. The film was nominated for Most Anticipated Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards."
