Pine will also star in the film alongside Annette Bening and Danny DeVito.[2] Pine came up with the idea for the film during a conversation with director Patty Jenkins, who will serve as a producer.[4] In May, Ariana DeBose and Jennifer Jason Leigh were added to the cast, with Matthew Jensen set as cinematographer.[5] In July, DeWanda Wise joined the cast.[6]\nFilming began in June 2022 in Los Angeles.[7] The film moved to post-production by November 2022, with the distribution rights being sold by AGC International to Paramount Pictures, StudioCanal, Lionsgate Films and other companies for multiple countries outside the United States.[8] The rights for the UK and Ireland were sold to Signature Entertainment.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nPoolman's world premiere took place at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2023.[9][10] In December 2023, Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film.[11]\nThe film is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 10, 2024.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 23% of 26 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.1/10.[13] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 20 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[14]\nMichael Rechtshaffen, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, called the film a \"shrill misfire\" and predicted that it would \"likely have a tough time finding a home\".[15] Siddhant Adlakha from IndieWire opined that the film was \"disastrous\" and \"[i]t\u2019s only 100 minutes long, but upward of 99 of those minutes are likely to be spent in silent boredom, if not irritated disbelief at being subjected to such guileless, artless nonsense\".[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Poolman (15)\".
