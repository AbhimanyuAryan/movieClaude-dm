        "Sara Hopkins is a young kind girl with a strong faith in God. One day when she's at the lake with her brother Danny and his girlfriend, she finds a dead bird but thinks she can pray to God to heal it and she does, though her family are skeptical. Later, when Danny saves his rival, Alvie, Alvie's dog is hit by a car; the dog is miraculously healed by Sara, to everyone's astonishment. Inspired, Sara's best friend, Mark, a paraplegic, asks Sara to pray with him, and ultimately, he is able to walk again. Sara becomes a national celebrity when more miracles are attributed to her, and she begins to heal blind and sick children. Sara's family becomes concerned when Sara falls after praying many times, and learn that she is dying of an inoperable brain tumor.",
        "The doctor suggests that they take Sara to the hospital to make her comfortable, but Sara wants to go to the lake where she first saw God, so her Grandpa makes a plan with the townsfolk to break her out of the hospital. They succeed and rush to the lake against her parents wishes and when they get there, God appears and Sara's spirit appears before him and they both disappear while everyone mourns her death. However, Danny discovers a painting of her leaving God to go back to her family, meaning she's still alive so he prays for her to come back and she awakens. No less humble, she tells the townsfolk that God healed those people and not her."
