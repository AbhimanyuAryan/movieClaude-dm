        "Tattoo artist Jimmy Jayne is interviewed by Detectives Bill Freeman and Freddy Vargas, who are investigating a mass murder of prostitutes, after a lighter inscribed with his studio's name is found at the crime scene. Jayne is an ex-convict who did five years in prison for accidental manslaughter, and he was the last person to see one of the victims alive. Eventually, Freeman is revealed to be part of a human trafficking ring operating via a tunnel connecting San Diego to Tijuana. The film culminates in a shootout between Freeman and Jayne in a Mexican warehouse; with his expert marksman skills, Jayne incapacitates the rogue detective and his associate with a handful of bullets, and sets the place ablaze."
