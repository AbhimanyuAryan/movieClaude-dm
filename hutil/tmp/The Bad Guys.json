The film was directed by Pierre Perifel (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Etan Cohen, and stars the voices of Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Awkwafina, Craig Robinson, Anthony Ramos, Richard Ayoade, Zazie Beetz, Alex Borstein, and Lilly Singh. It tells the story of a criminal group of anthropomorphic animals who, upon being caught, pretend to attempt to reform themselves as model citizens, only for their leader to find himself genuinely drawn to changing his ways for good as a new villain has his own plans.\nWork on the film started in March 2018, with Cohen writing the screenplay; the characters and themes drew inspiration from various crime films and anime series such as Pulp Fiction (1994), the Ocean's film trilogy, Lupin III, and Sherlock Hound, while the inspiration for the film's animation style came from Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). Production began at DreamWorks Animation's Glendale campus and some additional production assets were borrowed from Jellyfish Pictures, with voice acting being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Bad Guys was released theatrically in several countries beginning March 16, 2022, and in the United States on April 22, in 2D and RealD 3D formats. It received positive reviews from critics for its animation, screenplay, humor, and voice acting. It was also a box office success, grossing $250 million worldwide. A sequel is in development and is set to be released on August 1, 2025.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn a world where humans and anthropomorphic animals coexist, pickpocket and robber Mr. Wolf leads The Bad Guys, a gang of infamous criminal animals known for their thefts and escapades. His gang consists of his best friend and second-in-command, Mr. Snake, Mr. Pirahna, Mr. Shark and Ms. Tarantula.\nAfter being insulted by Governor Diane Foxington on live television for their predictability, Wolf convinces his gang to pull off a heist to steal a valuable award, the Golden Dolphin, before it is awarded to guinea pig philanthropist Professor Marmalade. At the gala, Wolf inadvertently helps an elderly woman and feels good for it, which arise conflicted feelings on him and delay their escape, resulting in their arrest. Secretly planning to steal the award again, Wolf persuades Foxington to let Marmalade reform them.\nMarmalade's initial attempts to reform the gang are disastrous and an attempt to rescue guinea pigs from a research lab goes awry due to Snake eating them. Foxington decides to call off the experiment, but relents when Wolf confesses that he became a criminal because it was easier to fall into the villainous role society expects of him due to his species; she admits she understands and has hope for him. Wolf then finds himself rescuing a cat from a tree, which Marmalade records and publishes, turning the public image of the gang around.\nAt a charity event set up by Marmalade, Wolf, having fallen in love with Foxington and convinced that he and his gang could actually go good, ultimately decides to take the offer of a fresh start. In sudden poor timing, however, a meteorite which was on display is stolen, and the gang is blamed and arrested. Marmalade meets them in private and reveals that he stole the meteorite and had planned for the gang to be framed. He also reveals that he was the old woman Wolf had helped at the first gala, having Snake manipulated against Wolf, much to Wolf's fury as he tries to attack Marmalade but opens the door in public making him look worse.\nIn prison, Wolf tells his gang that he does not want to be a criminal anymore and that he believes a better life is possible for all of them. Snake rejects his proposal, adamant their public perception cannot be turned, which causes the two to fight. Their fight is interrupted when a mysterious person, soon revealed to be Foxington, rescues them. Wolf identifies her as The Crimson Paw, a former criminal mastermind. She figured that Marmalade framed them. Now free, the gang still blindly reject Wolf, who goes with Foxington. The gang finds their hideout wholly emptied of their loot, as Wolf had revealed its location to Foxington earlier to atone for his crimes. After Snake willingly gives Shark his last Push Pop out of kindness, they realize that Wolf was right and set out to help him. However, Snake denies it and leaves to ally with Marmalade, who plans to use the meteorite to power a device to hypnotize an army of guinea pigs into stealing his own charity funds. Foxington reveals to Wolf that she reformed when she was about to steal the Golden Dolphin, realizing that she was not being anything more than what everyone saw her as. \nWolf and Foxington break into Marmalade's home to steal the meteorite, only to be captured by Marmalade and Snake. The rest of the gang rescues them and steals the meteorite while foiling Marmalade's heist. Chasing them to get Snake back, Marmalade kicks Snake out of his helicopter to blackmail Wolf to give him the meteorite back. The gang manage to rescue Snake and make up with him once more, incidentally destroying Marmalade's mind control helmet in the process. After the fact they willingly hand themselves over to take responsibility for their many crimes, with Wolf stopping Foxington from admitting to her criminal past, believing she has already made up for it with the good she does as governor.\nMarmalade attempts to take credit for recovering the meteorite, but it is revealed to be a fake planted by Snake, who had faked his defection and secretly switched it for the manor's meteorite-shaped lamp and rigged the real meteorite to explode, blowing up Marmalade's manor and exposing him as the thief. When the lamp falls on Marmalade, a diamond that he stole from Foxington falls out of his suit, which police chief Misty Luggins recognizes as having been stolen by the Crimson Paw years ago. With his true nature exposed, and implicated as the Crimson Paw, Marmalade is arrested. As the gang celebrates Marmalade's defeat, Wolf then reveals to Snake that he deliberately left behind the Push Pop, much to Snake's shock.\nThe gang is still sent to prison for their former crimes but released for good behavior after one year, and join Foxington to begin their new lives.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nThe titular group of criminal animals are voiced by Sam Rockwell (Mr. Wolf), Marc Maron (Mr. Snake), Awkwafina (Ms. Tarantula), Craig Robinson (Mr. Shark) and Anthony Ramos (Mr. Piranha) respectively.\nThe other two anthropomorphic animals, Professor Marmalade and Diane Foxington, are voiced by Richard Ayoade and Zazie Beetz respectively.\nSam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf, a witty, charming, pickpocket wolf and the leader of \"The Bad Guys\" gang, who also acts as the gang's getaway driver.\nMarc Maron as Mr. Snake, a feisty, sarcastic and cynical safe-cracking snake, Wolf's second-in-command, as well as his best friend.[9]\nAwkwafina as Ms. Tarantula, a sharp-tongued and sarcastic expert hacker tarantula also known as \"Webs\".\nCraig Robinson as Mr. Shark, a childish and sensitive master of disguise shark.\nAnthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha, a short-fused, loose-cannon piranha and the \"muscle\" of the gang.\nRichard Ayoade as Professor Marmalade, a wealthy guinea pig philanthropist and scientist who suggests that Wolf's group start doing \"good deeds\", but is secretly an evil and greedy individual intending to steal from his own charity.\nZazie Beetz as Diane Foxington (a.k.a.

Character designs took inspiration from a mix of styles from directors such as Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, Michael Mann\u2019s Heat, Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven, and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction. The film was also inspired by anime and manga series such as Sherlock Hound and Lupin III as well as the French-Belgian animated film Ernest & Celestine, due to how it influenced the approach to the characters.[18]\nWhile most of the animation for the film was provided by DWA Glendale, Jellyfish Pictures, who previously worked with DreamWorks on How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming, Spirit Untamed and The Boss Baby: Family Business, handled the additional asset production services using proprietary softwares like Premo and Moonray, along with a new tool called Doodle \u2013 created for the 2D effects and for allowing the animators to move the lines around the character rigs. The film's opening diner scene, inspired by the similar opening scene from Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, is the longest one-shot in DreamWorks Animation history \u2013 it lasts two minutes, 25 seconds and seven frames.[19][20]\n\nMusic[edit]\n\n\nThe Bad Guys (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)[21]Film score by Daniel PembertonReleasedMarch 31, 2022StudioDreamWorks AnimationGenreScoreLabelBack Lot MusicDreamWorks Animation soundtrack chronology\n\n\nThe Boss Baby: Family Business(2021)\n\nThe Bad Guys (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)[21](2022)\n\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish(2022)\nDaniel Pemberton chronology\n\n\nBeing the Ricardos(2021)\n\nThe Bad Guys (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)(2022)\n\nEnola Holmes 2(2022)\n\nSingles from  The Bad Guys (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) \n\"Good Tonight\"Released: March 18, 2022\n\"Feeling Alright\"Released: March 25, 2022\n\"Good Tonight (Party Pupils Remix)\"Released: April 22, 2022\n\n\nOn June 22, 2021, Daniel Pemberton was signed to compose the score for the film, having previously composed the soundtrack for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.[22] A song \"Good Tonight\" written by Pemberton and Gary Go was made and released on March 18 by Back Lot Music, performed by Anthony Ramos, who does the additional lyrics with Will Wells.

The first trailer was also shown during theater screenings of Sing 2. A second trailer, released on February 23, 2022, accumulated nearly a quarter of a billion views by the time of the film's release. Social media analytic RelishMix said the film had a social media reach of 220 million before its debut, which was significantly lower than Sonic the Hedgehog 2's reach of 445 million, though they noted the high subscriber rate of the child-friendly DreamWorks YouTube channel.

The Bad Guys also had a tie-in with the 2022 March Madness tournament, featuring a virtual bracket for the film's characters and commercials during pre and post-game coverage on TNT and TBS. A Snapchat AR lens of Mr. Wolf and a TikTok trend set to Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\" were used to promote the film. Deadline Hollywood said Universal took advantage of April Fool's Day (April 1), the day tickets went on sale, with the release of another Snapchat AR lens that went viral after it was used by popular influencers such as MrBeast and Michael Le, gaining 21.5 million views and over 1.8 million likes on TikTok.[2]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nOn October 7, 2019, it was reported that the film would be theatrically released on September 17, 2021, taking over the release date of Spooky Jack.[15] In December 2020, the film was delayed with The Boss Baby: Family Business taking its original slot, though it was confirmed that it would get a new date \"within the coming weeks\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[23] In March 2021, the release date was rescheduled to April 15, 2022.[24] In October 2021, it was pushed back again by one week to April 22.[25] The Bad Guys had a red carpet screening at the Ace Hotel Los Angeles on April 12, 2022, with Beetz in attendance.[26] On March 1, 2022, Universal pulled the release in Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[27]\n\nHome media and streaming[edit]\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment released The Bad Guys on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray and for digital download in the United States on June 21, 2022.[28] The film was released on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service on July 1, 2022.[29][30] As part of their 18-month deal with Netflix, the film streamed on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Netflix on November 1, 2022, for the next ten, returning to Peacock on September 1, 2023, for the next four, and finally moving to Amazon Prime Video on January 1, 2024.[31][32]\nA 3D Blu-ray release of the film was released in Australia on May 10, 2023.[33]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe Bad Guys grossed $97.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $153.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $250.4 million.[4][5]\nIn the United States and Canada, The Bad Guys was released alongside The Northman and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and was projected to gross $13\u201320 million from 4,008 theaters in its opening weekend.[34][35][36] The film made $8 million on its first day, including $1.15 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $24 million, topping the box office.[37] Deadline Hollywood noted that the over-performance was thanks to a diverse turnout, big marketing push, and recent success of family films. Women made up 56% of the audience during its opening. The ethnic breakdown of the audience showed that 40% Caucasian, 25% Latino and Hispanic, 20% African American, and 9% Asian or other.[2] The film grossed $16.2 million in its second weekend, finishing first again.[38] It made $9.6 million in its third weekend and $7 million in its fourth, both times finishing second behind newcomer Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.[39][40] It stayed in the box office top ten until its eleventh weekend.[41]\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, the film earned $8.5 million from 25 international markets in its opening weekend.[42] This included a strong $1.7 million opening in Spain, where it finished ahead of The Batman and tied with Encanto as the best debut in the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.[43] In its second weekend, it made $6.5 million from 37 markets.[44] Its third weekend added $10.5 million, which included a $3.1 million debut in the UK and $1.7 million from Australia, where the film had the best opening for an animated film since the start of the pandemic.[45] It made $7.5 million in its fourth weekend, which included a debut in France of $1.5 million.[46] The film crossed the $50 million mark outside the U.S. and Canada in its fifth weekend, ahead of its North American release, after adding $6.5 million.[47] In its sixth weekend, the film made $5.9 million, which Deadline Hollywood noted as a \"terrific 9% drop\" before its release in China on April 29.[48] The film added $9 million in its seventh weekend. This included an opening of $4.53 million in China, where it received a \"strong\" 9.1/10 rating from audiences on the Maoyan website.[49] The film earned $7.2 million the following weekend, which included a debut of $1.93 million in Korea.

The website's consensus reads: \"Fast-paced, funny, and full of colorful visual appeal, The Bad Guys is good news for audiences seeking options the whole family can enjoy.\"[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[57] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average score of 4 out of 5 stars.[2]\nThe Washington Post's Kristen Page-Kirby gave 3 stars out of 4, and concluded: \"The moral of the story doesn't pack a huge wallop. Not that it needs to. (We can't all be Encanto.) Still, it's clever, visually interesting and very, very funny. Even when the humor goes lowbrow, it makes narrative sense. A joke about flatulence is a lot funnier when it's essential to the plot. The Bad Guys gets that. In fact, The Bad Guys gets a lot of things. It knows precisely what it is \u2014 and what it sets out to do, it does well. It's a heist film with heart and humor, and where's the crime in that?\"[58] IGN's Ryan Leston gave a rating of 8 out of 10 and wrote: The Bad Guys is a slick, hilarious heist movie with buckets of laughs and a lot of heart. It's Ocean's Eleven meets Little Red Riding Hood with Sam Rockwell's Wolf going on a charm offensive to stay out of jail... and he might just win you over in the process. Richard Ayoade has a blast as the sanctimonious Professor Marmalade and the entire voice cast brings their A-game with some stellar gags that will get you roaring with laughter. The Bad Guys is a fun, family-friendly caper that's bursting with action and brimming with laughs.\"[59] Chicago Sun-Times's Richard Roeper gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, and commented that \"The animation combines computer-generated 2D and 3D with a look that will remind you of a Saturday-morning cartoon\u2014only much crisper and more dazzling. There's nothing photorealistic about the animation; it's stylized and has very specific definition of Heist Movie Los Angeles, with the sky so bright it's almost overexposed, and yet somehow creating a bit of a noir vibe. This is a great-looking film with terrific performances, some lovely messaging and a steady parade of solid laughs\u2014some the kids will enjoy and just as many targeted squarely at the grown-up kids in the audience.\"[60]\nThe Guardian's Wendy Ide gave 3 stars out of 5 and said: \"Like Roger Rabbit, the pacing owes a debt to the demented frenzy of classic Looney Tunes animations, but the film also nods to heist movies, notably the Oceans series. It's deliberately preposterous \u2013 the disguises are rarely more convincing than the kind of false nose and moustache combo you might find in a cracker. But there's a kernel of believability where it matters: in the easy repartee and fully fleshed friendships. It's sharp, silly and frequently very funny.\"[61]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of Ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nHeartland Film Festival\n\nMarch 18, 2022\n\nTruly Moving Picture Award\n\nThe Bad Guys\n\nWon\n\n[62]\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nThe Bad Guys\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nSatellite Awards\n\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nBest Motion Picture - Animated or Mixed Media\n\nThe Bad Guys\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nOutstanding Voice Performance\n\nZazie Beetz\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nVisual Effects Society Awards\n\nFebruary 15, 2023\n\nOutstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Feature\n\nThe Bad Guys\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nKids' Choice Awards\n\nMarch 4, 2023\n\nFavorite Animated Movie\n\nThe Bad Guys\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nFavorite Female Voice From an Animated Movie\n\nAwkwafina as Tarantula\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nAnnie Awards\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nOutstanding Achievement for Character Animation in an Animated Feature Production\n\nJorge Capote\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nMin Hong\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Achievement for Character Design in an Animated Feature Production\n\nTaylor Krahenbuhl\n\nWon\n\n\nOutstanding Achievement for Music in an Animated Feature Production\n\nDaniel Pemberton\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Achievement for Production Design in an Animated Feature Production\n\nLuc Desmarchelier, Floriane Marchix\n\nNominated\n\n\nArtios Awards\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nAnimation\n\nChristi Soper Hilt\n\nNominated\n\n\n\nThe film was awarded the title of Truly Moving Picture Award at the 2022 Heartland Film Festival and was nominated for Best Animated Film at the Hollywood Critics Association and Satellite Awards.[63][64][65] Beetz received a nomination for Outstanding Voice Performance at the 2023 Black Reel Awards.[66] The film also was nominated for Outstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Feature at the 21st Visual Effects Society Awards, a Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie as well as Awkwafina receiving a nomination for Favorite Female Voice From an Animated Movie at the 2023 Kids' Choice Awards, and for five Annie Awards (winning one).[67][68][69]\nThe film was nominated for Best Edited Animated Feature Film[70] and for Outstanding Achievement in Casting at the 38th Artios Awards.[71]\n\nFuture[edit]\nSequel[edit]\nIn March 2022, a month before the film was released, Perifel said that he would love to do a sequel.[72] Two years later, DreamWorks Animation officially confirmed a sequel with a release date set for August 1, 2025.
