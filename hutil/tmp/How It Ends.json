        "The film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 29, 2021. It was also scheduled to screen at South by Southwest in March 2021, which ended up being a virtual SXSW festival as the COVID-19 pandemic in Austin remained troubling. In May 2021, American International Pictures acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film, and set it for a release in the United States on July 20, 2021. However, subsequent worldwide waves extended the COVID-19 pandemic through 2021, and the film was released through video-on-demand and streaming services."
