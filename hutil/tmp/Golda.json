The film depicts actions of Golda Meir, the 4th Prime Minister of Israel, during the Yom Kippur War. It stars Helen Mirren, Camille Cottin and Liev Schreiber.\nIt received its world premiere at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival on February 20, 2023. It was released in the United States by Bleecker Street and Shivhans Pictures on August 25, 2023 and was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Vertical Entertainment and MetFilm Distribution on October 6, 2023. The film received a Best Makeup and Hairstyling nomination at the 96th Academy Awards.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn October 1973, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad receives intelligence implying that Egypt and Syria are preparing to commence a military campaign against Israel, which it promptly relays to the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir. Meir is dismissive of the intelligence, noting her inability to initiate a counter-plan without the support of her defense minister, Moshe Dayan, who is equally skeptical. \nOn 6 October, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Meir's inner circle informs her that Egypt has amassed a large force opposite the Suez Canal, concluding that hostilities would begin by sundown. Although realizing her tardiness in preparing adequately, Meir refuses to make a pre-emptive move, instead ordering a partial mobilization to face the threat. Nevertheless, she is surprised when the attack begins early. Dayan, who is sent to inspect the Golan Heights on the Syrian border, is horrified to discover that Syria has launched a thorough attack against the ill-prepared Israeli troops. Dazed, he attempts to resign; Meir talks him out of it but loses confidence in him.\nBetween 7-8 October, with Egypt and Syria making gains into Israel, Israeli Defence Force chief of staff Lieutenant General David Elazar proposes to relieve Israeli fortifications in the Sinai Peninsula using the 162nd Division led by Major General Avraham Adan. Despite opposition from Mossad chief Zvi Zamir, the plan proceeds, but the Egyptians defeat the Israeli force. The next day, with the Syrian offensive having slowed, Dayan proposes an air strike on Syrian capital Damascus to put pressure on Egypt. However, with a shortage of planes, the Israeli Air Force is unable to proceed. In response, Meir asks United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to provide surplus jets, to which he reluctantly agrees, though he expresses that it is problematic for the United States to increase its support for Israel in light of the 1973 oil crisis.\nOn the fifth day, amidst increasing tensions, Major General Ariel Sharon proposes an operation to cross the Suez Canal using the 143rd Division to challenge the Egyptian Second and Third Armies. Zvi informs Meir that the Egyptian 4th and 21st Divisions would cross the canal in two days, leaving Egyptian capital Cairo undefended in the event of an attack. According to the intelligence, the Egyptians cross the canal, are met with resistance from Israeli tank forces led by Lieutenant General Haim Bar-Lev, and are defeated.\nOn 15 October, Sharon's forces cross the canal at an undefended point called the \"Chinese Farm\". They are ambushed by Egyptian units but maintain their positions. Meanwhile, Elazar prepares to barricade the Third Army by cutting off Suez from Cairo, which would accordingly force Egypt into negotiations. Concurrently, Kissinger pays a private visit to Meir and urges her to accept a ceasefire. Meir proceeds with her plan anyway, which finally forces Egypt into talks. \nBy the twentieth day, both sides agree to the further diplomatic talks and to exchange prisoners of war, effectively concluding the conflict. However, Zvi privately informs Meir that military intelligence chief Major General Eli Zeira had neglected to properly monitor signals intelligence from the Egyptian side, which allowed Israel to be attacked unawares. Although appalled, she chooses to bear the blame, rather than reveal the existence of the listening system. Despite the victory, the conflict's intensity inflicts an emotional toll on the aged Meir, who is stricken with cancer. \nOne year later, in 1974, Meir testifies before the Agranat Commission about her conduct in the war. She states off-the-record that despite her initial uncertainty, she genuinely felt war was certain. Four years later, on 8 October 1978, a bedridden Meir dies watching footage of her meeting with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat a year earlier. \nThe film's epilogue reveals that the commission cleared Meir of any wrongdoing and that she lived to see the signing of the Camp David Accords, the first formal measures of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nHelen Mirren as Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel\nCamille Cottin as Lou Kaddar, private secretary to Golda Meir\nRami Heuberger as Moshe Dayan, Minister of Defense for Israel\nRotem Keinan as Zvi Zamir, Director of Mossad\nEmma Davies as Miss Epstein, a typist in the Prime Minister's Office\nLior Ashkenazi as Lt.

You just couldn't even go there.\"[10][11] The following month, Mirren responded by saying Lipman was \"utterly legitimate\" to criticize her casting, and she had discussed the decision to cast her in the film with director Nattiv.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn July 2021, Bleecker Street and ShivHans Pictures acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.[13] In August 2023, Vertical Entertainment acquired U.K. and Irish distribution rights in partnership with MetFilm Distribution.[14] It had its world premiere at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 20, 2023.[15] It also screened at the Jerusalem Film Festival on July 13, 2023.[16] It was released in Israel on August 24, 2023, by United King Films\u00a0[he],[17] and in the United States the next day, on August 25, 2023.[18] The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and Ireland on October 6, 2023.[14]\nGolda was released for digital platforms on September 19, 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on October 17, 2023.[19]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, Golda was released alongside Gran Turismo, The Hill, and Retribution, and was projected to gross around $1 million from 883 theaters in its opening weekend.[20] It finished its run with $4.8 million in the United States and $6 million worldwide.[21]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of 122 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Helen Mirren is typically masterful in the title role, but Golda never amounts to much more than a passable history lesson presented in largely underwhelming biopic form.\"[22] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[23]\nThe film was described as \"typical Israeli propaganda\" in one review, by Ramzy Baroud, published in Arab News and Middle East Monitor.[24][25]\nA New York Times review by Amy Nicholson concluded that against the backdrop of a surprise attack on Israel, the script, by Nicholas Martin, focuses on the haunting body count rather than the righteousness of the conflict, where one is \u201cleft with a sense that the stress of those thousands of lives cut short may have killed her (Golda) too.\u201d[26]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nWorld Soundtrack Awards\n\nOctober 21, 2023\n\nDiscovery of the Year\n\nDascha Dauenhauer\n\nNominated\n\n[27]\n\n\nWomen Film Critics Circle\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nBest Actress\n\nHelen Mirren\n\n4th place\n\n[28]\n\n\nBest Equality of the Sexes\n\nGolda\n\nNominated\n\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nGrand Dame for Defying Ageism\n\nHelen Mirren (also for Fast X)\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\n\nAARP Movies for Grownups Awards\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nBest Actress\n\nHelen Mirren\n\nNominated\n\n[30]\n\n\nCinema for Peace Awards\n\nFebruary 19, 2024\n\nMost Valuable Film of the Year 2024\n\nGuy Nattiv\n\nWon\n\n[31]\n\n\nMake-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild\n\nFebruary 18, 2024\n\nBest Special Make-Up Effects\n\nKaren Thomas, Eva Susanna Johnson Theodosiou\n\nNominated\n\n[32]\n\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nBest Makeup and Hairstyling\n\nNominated\n\n[33]\n\nSee also[edit]\nA Woman Called Golda, a 1982 biographical TV film\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Golda (12A)\".
