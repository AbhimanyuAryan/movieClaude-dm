The film also stars Samara Weaving, Lucy Boynton, Marton Csokas, Alex Fitzalan, Minnie Driver, and Ronk\u1eb9 Ad\u00e9kolu\u1eb9jo.\nChevalier had its world premiere at the 47th Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2022, and was released in the United States by Searchlight Pictures on April 21, 2023. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn the late 1770s Mozart visits Paris.[3][a] He is performing on stage when a man who introduces himself as Joseph Bologne requests to accompany his performance of Violin Concerto No. 5. Initially, both Mozart and the audience underestimate Joseph, but once he impresses them with his performance, the two musicians perform battling cadenza pieces, ending in a triumph for Joseph.\nJoseph is born in Guadeloupe to Georges de Bologne\u00a0[fr], a white French slaveowner, and Nanon, a young slavewoman of African descent, on Bologne's plantation. As a child, Joseph is taken to a boarding school in Paris after his father notices his skills in music, dancing, and fencing. Joseph is harassed, bullied, and mistreated by many of his white peers and white teachers but excels at his studies in violin playing and composition. At the royal court, Marie Antoinette is impressed after seeing him win a fencing contest, and she grants him the title \"Chevalier\" (French for \"knight\") de Saint-Georges. Saint-Georges becomes a favored companion of the Queen and is a popular member of the court. Saint-Georges also attracts the attention of many female suitors, particularly Marie-Madeleine Guimard, but he falls in love with Marie-Jos\u00e9phine\u00a0[fr].\nSaint-Georges seeks to become the director of the Paris Opera, but the committee in charge favors a rival, Christoph Willibald Gluck. He goes to Marie-Jos\u00e9phine's cousin, St\u00e9phanie F\u00e9licit\u00e9, comtesse de Genlis, who agrees to produce an opera he has written to demonstrate his talent. Marie-Jos\u00e9phine agrees to be the lead singer of his opera, even though her husband, Marc-Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert, refuses to allow her to perform. She leads the opera anyway and begins an affair with Saint-Georges.\nAfter his father's death, Saint-Georges' mother is freed from enslavement, and he pays for her to join him in Paris. However, he slowly grows to resent his mother as she sees him as rejecting his true self in order to appease the white-dominated society around him. He is also ambivalent to the growing social discontent, intellectual discourse, and the large black population that surrounds him in Paris.\nMarie Antoinette informs Saint-Georges that the committee will never choose him because no performer will work under a black man. She refuses to defend him and compromise her own standing among the nobility. Saint-Georges attends Gluck's debut and drinks heavily. After he publicly insults Gluck, Guimard, and the Queen, Marc-Ren\u00e9 has him restrained and beaten for dishonoring his wife. Months later, Marie-Jos\u00e9phine gives birth to a mixed-race child; the infant is killed on her husband's orders. Now ostracized from high society, Saint-Georges becomes close with his mother and embraces his true heritage.\nAs the French Revolution begins, Saint-Georges organizes a concert to raise funds for the anti-royalist faction. Marie-Jos\u00e9phine and Marie Antoinette both visit him separately, but he rejects their attempts to win back his friendship. The Queen threatens to revoke his status as Chevalier and have him arrested if he puts on his concert. Saint-Georges plays the concert anyway, with his natural hair no longer hidden by a powdered wig, and is nearly arrested by Marc-Ren\u00e9. The audience members, however, rise against the officers, and Marc-Ren\u00e9 is forced to let him go. Saint-Georges walks out, passing the Queen and protestors.\nA textual epilogue reveals that, in 1802, Napoleon prohibited Chevalier's music productions and re-instated slavery in French colonies.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKelvin Harrison Jr. as Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges\nSamara Weaving as Marie-Jos\u00e9phine de Comarieu de Montalembert\nLucy Boynton as Marie Antoinette\nRonk\u1eb9 Ad\u00e9kolu\u1eb9jo as Nanon, Joseph's mother\nMarton Csokas as Marc Ren\u00e9, marquis de Montalembert\nAlex Fitzalan as Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans\nMinnie Driver as Marie-Madeleine Guimard\nHenry Lloyd-Hughes as Christoph Willibald Gluck\nSian Clifford as St\u00e9phanie F\u00e9licit\u00e9, comtesse de Genlis\nSam Barlien as Louis XVI\nJoseph Prowen as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2020, it was reported that Searchlight Pictures had bought a feature pitch from Atlanta's Stefani Robinson for Chevalier de Saint-Georges, a biopic about the musician of the same name, with Stephen Williams attached to direct.[8] In March 2021, it was reported that Kelvin Harrison Jr. was cast in the lead role of Saint-Georges.[9] In July 2021, Samara Weaving joined the cast as the female lead.[10] The following month, Lucy Boynton and Minnie Driver were added to the main cast, with Alex Fitzalan cast in a supporting role and the film's title shortened to Chevalier.[11][12][13]\nPrincipal photography began on September 7, 2021, in Prague,[14] and ended in November 2021.\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Chevalier (soundtrack)\nThe film was scored by Kris Bowers and the soundtrack was released alongside the film.\n\nRelease[edit]\nChevalier had its world premiere at the 47th Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2022.[15][16] Originally set to be released by Searchlight Pictures in theaters on April 7, 2023,[17] the date was pushed back to April 21, 2023.[18]\nThe film was released for digital platforms on June 16, 2023.[19]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nChevalier grossed $3.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $615,645 in the United Kingdom, for a total worldwide of $4.2 million.[2][20]\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Covenant, Evil Dead Rise, and the wide expansion of Beau Is Afraid, and was projected to gross $1\u20133 million from 1,275 theaters in its opening weekend.[21] It ended up debuting to $1.5 million, finishing 11th at the box office.[22] The film had a budget of $46 Million.
