The website's critics consensus reads: \"Archenemy fails to follow through on some of its more interesting ideas, but Joe Manganiello's lead performance and the picture's infectious raw energy make for a fun action-adventure.\"[12] Metacritic reports a score of 57 out of 100 based on seven critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[13]\n\nPossible sequel[edit]\nIn December 2020, while speaking to Bloody Disgusting, Mortimer confirmed a \"Vortex Trilogy\" consisting of Daniel Isn't Real, Archenemy, and a planned third film, saying \"mark my words we are going to make a third movie in the Vortex Trilogy that will have Daniel return and force Max, in some form, to deal with it. A crisis on infinite vortices pulling together as many of the characters from both stories as we can fit for a true cosmic horror/cosmic action crossover hybrid!\"[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Archenemy\".
