    "Plot": [
        "The beautiful Julia Thistlewaite attends the opera with the most eligible bachelor of the season, Mr. Jeremy Malcolm. After she fails to impress him she is widely mocked in a caricature. Julia employs her cousin, the feckless Lord Cassidy, to see what she has done to offend Mr. Malcolm. Malcolm reveals to Cassidy that he has a list of requirements for a wife which Julia did not meet. Cassidy lets this slip to Julia who is offended.",
        "Julia decides to invite her friend, Selina Dalton to London to try and exact revenge on Mr. Malcolm, training her reluctant friend to act as the perfect potential bride.",
        "On the night she is to meet Mr. Malcolm, Selina accidentally runs into him in the orangery where the two debate philosophy and are immediately attracted to one another. When they are formally introduced, Mr. Malcolm invites Selina to the museum with him where he pleads his case that he and Julia had a very weak connection. While there the two run into Captain Ossery, with whom Selina was previously acquainted, having served as his aunt's companion in Bath.",
        "The following day, Ossery invites Selina to go walking with him and formally announces his intention to court her, as his aunt's final letter to him expressed her desire for the two of them to be matched.",
        "Mr. Malcolm does not stop his pursuit of Selina and, aided by Julia's machinations, she continues to present as his perfect woman. When Julia and Selina accidentally run into Selina's vulgar cousin Gertie Covington, Julia claims her as her own relation. Mr. Malcolm later privately expresses to Selina he is glad she is not related to someone so crass and Selina is upset by the news. When Mr. Malcolm learns the truth, he privately apologizes to Selina and even extends an invitation to Gertie to join him and the rest of the party at his country estate where he intends to propose to Selina.",
        "Julia decides that Mr. Malcolm is suitably in love with Selina, and determines it is time for Selina to reject him. However Selina reveals she no longer wants to go forward with the plan, as she believes Mr. Malcolm is honourable and had no intention of hurting Julia.",
        "At a masquerade, where Mr. Malcolm plans to propose to Selina, Julia has her maid call away Selina and lock her in a room, before sending a message to Mr. Malcolm to meet him in secret while posing as Selina. When Mr. Malcolm proposes, Julia rejects him and runs away, only to be immediately found out by Selina, Malcolm, and Ossery. She reveals she is still hurt by Mr. Malcolm's rejection and that Selina was a participant in her scheme, causing Mr. Malcolm to become upset and reject Selina as well.",
        "The following day a now guilt-ridden Julia tries another scheme to reunite Malcolm and Selina, but is dissuaded by Ossery who confesses he has fallen in love with her. Mr. Malcolm and Selina later find themselves alone in the garden, and Mr. Malcolm accuses Selina of trying to trap him in an engagement; infuriated she wishes him luck with his list.",
        "After Julia apologizes, Selina decides to leave for home. As she does, Mr. Malcolm's mother blames her son for Selina's departure revealing that she was the one who plotted to have the two alone in the garden. Mr. Malcolm chases after Selina and gives her a new list of everything he is looking for in a wife, the sole line reading \"Selina Dalton\"."

        "Suzanne Allain self-published her novel Mr. Malcolm's List in 2009 and subsequently adapted it into a script. The script was discovered by filmmaker Emma Holly Jones when The Black List did a podcast script reading of the highly rated script submitted through the website in 2015. Jones pursued the rights and then brought on producer Laura Rister and subsequently Laura Lewis to produce the feature film adaptation. The team decided to make a short film, overture as a teaser to the feature version and partnered with Vice Studios' Refinery29 and their Shatterbox short film series for female filmmakers to make the short. It was shot in October 2018 in London and was released online on February 14, 2019 and, to date, has had over 2 million views. It starred Sope Dirisu, Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Freida Pinto. Based on its success, Suzanne's novel was published in 2020 by Berkley Press and the feature film was financed.
