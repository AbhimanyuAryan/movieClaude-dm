The film features an ensemble cast that includes Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Edgar Ram\u00edrez, Ariana Greenblatt, Bobby Lee, Florian Munteanu, Gina Gershon, and Jamie Lee Curtis.[1]\nBorderlands is scheduled to be released in the United States by Lionsgate on August 9, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nLilith, an infamous outlaw with a mysterious past, reluctantly returns to her home planet of Pandora to find the missing daughter of the universe's most powerful S.O.B., Atlas. Lilith forms an alliance with an unexpected team - Roland, a former elite mercenary, now desperate for redemption; Tiny Tina, a feral pre-teen demolitionist; Krieg, Tina's musclebound, rhetorically challenged protector; Tannis, the scientist with a tenuous grip on sanity; and Claptrap, a persistently wiseass robot. These unlikely heroes must battle alien monsters and dangerous bandits to find and protect the missing girl, who may hold the key to unimaginable power. The fate of the universe could be in their hands but they'll be fighting for something more: each other.[2]\u2014\u200aLionsgate Films\nCast[edit]\nCate Blanchett as Lilith\nKevin Hart as Roland\nJack Black as the voice of Claptrap\nEdgar Ram\u00edrez as Atlas\nAriana Greenblatt as Tiny Tina\nFlorian Munteanu as Krieg\nGina Gershon as Mad Moxxi\nJamie Lee Curtis as Dr. Patricia Tannis\nHaley Bennett\nBobby Lee as Larry\nOlivier Richters as Krom\nJanina Gavankar as Commander Knoxx\nCheyenne Jackson as Jakobs\nCharles Babalola as Hammerlock\nBenjamin Byron Davis as Marcus\nSteven Boyer as Scooter\nRyann Redmond as Ellie\nHarry Ford as Middleman\nAdditionally, Penn Jillette has a cameo  in the film as a preacher overseeing a wedding, after voicing Pain in the video game Borderlands 3 (2019).\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn May 2015, Leigh Whannell was in talks with Lionsgate Films to write and direct an adaptation of the video game series Borderlands.[3] The film was officially announced in August 2015, with Ari and Avi Arad of Arad Productions producing; however Whannell's involvement was left omitted.[4] Aaron Berg was tapped to pen an R-rated take on the material in April 2016.[5] By June 2018, Oren Uziel assumed scripting duties from Berg.[6][7]\nIn February 2020, Eli Roth was attached to direct the film from a screenplay written by Craig Mazin, with Erik Feig joining as producer through his production company Picturestart.[8] Cate Blanchett was cast as Lilith in May 2020.[9][10] Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black were confirmed to have joined the cast in January and February 2021.[11][12][13][14] The following month, Ariana Greenblatt, Florian Munteanu, and Haley Bennett were cast.[15][16][17] \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, Olivier Richters, and Janina Gavankar joined the ensemble in April, alongside Gina Gershon, Cheyenne Jackson, Charles Babalola, Benjamin Byron Davis, Steven Boyer, Ryann Redmond, and Bobby Lee.[18][19][20][21] By that month, Mazin's script had been rewritten by Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier; and again by Roth.[22] Penn Jillette announced in May that he would have a small role as a preacher in the film.[23]\n\nFilming[edit]\nFilming officially began on April 1, 2021 in Budapest, Hungary, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[24] The film wrapped on June 22.[25][26][27] On June 4, 2021, first look images of the cast were released, with black and white images obscuring all but the cast's silhouettes.[28]\n\nReshoots[edit]\nIn January 2023, it was announced the film would be going through two weeks of reshoots directed by Tim Miller, due to Roth's commitments to Thanksgiving (2023). While Roth would not be involved with the reshoots, he remained attached to the film and gave Miller his blessing.[29] Zak Olkewicz scribed new pages for Miller.[30] In June 2023, Mazin removed his name from the project, replaced by Joe Crombie; Mazin denied reports that Crombie was his pseudonym.[31] Additional literary material credits were given to Berg, Uziel, Taylor, Rettenmaier, Olkewicz, Chris Bremner, and Sam Levinson.[32]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn June 2021, Nathan Barr was announced to score the film, having collaborated with Roth in some of his previous works.[33] However, in October 2023, it was announced that Steve Jablonsky would be taking over scoring duties for Barr.[34]\n\nRelease[edit]\nBorderlands is set to be released theatrically in the United States by Lionsgate Films on August 9, 2024.[35][36][37]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nDuring Lionsgate's panel at the 2022 CinemaCon, approximately one-minute of exclusive footage was shown.[38]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of films based on video games\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Couch, Aaron (April 5, 2021). \"Edgar Ramirez Joins Lionsgate's 'Borderlands'\".
