    "Production": [
        "In May 2015, Leigh Whannell was in talks with Lionsgate Films to write and direct an adaptation of the video game series Borderlands. The film was officially announced in August 2015, with Ari and Avi Arad of Arad Productions producing; however Whannell's involvement was left omitted. Aaron Berg was tapped to pen an R-rated take on the material in April 2016. By June 2018, Oren Uziel assumed scripting duties from Berg.",
        "In February 2020, Eli Roth was attached to direct the film from a screenplay written by Craig Mazin, with Erik Feig joining as producer through his production company Picturestart. Cate Blanchett was cast as Lilith in May 2020. Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black were confirmed to have joined the cast in January and February 2021. The following month, Ariana Greenblatt, Florian Munteanu, and Haley Bennett were cast. \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, Olivier Richters, and Janina Gavankar joined the ensemble in April, alongside Gina Gershon, Cheyenne Jackson, Charles Babalola, Benjamin Byron Davis, Steven Boyer, Ryann Redmond, and Bobby Lee. By that month, Mazin's script had been rewritten by Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier; and again by Roth. Penn Jillette announced in May that he would have a small role as a preacher in the film.",
        "Filming officially began on April 1, 2021 in Budapest, Hungary, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film wrapped on June 22. On June 4, 2021, first look images of the cast were released, with black and white images obscuring all but the cast's silhouettes.",
        "In January 2023, it was announced the film would be going through two weeks of reshoots directed by Tim Miller, due to Roth's commitments to Thanksgiving (2023). While Roth would not be involved with the reshoots, he remained attached to the film and gave Miller his blessing. Zak Olkewicz scribed new pages for Miller. In June 2023, Mazin removed his name from the project, replaced by Joe Crombie; Mazin denied reports that Crombie was his pseudonym. Additional literary material credits were given to Berg, Uziel, Taylor, Rettenmaier, Olkewicz, Chris Bremner, and Sam Levinson."
