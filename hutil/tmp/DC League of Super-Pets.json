    "Plot": [
        "Superman grows up with a Kryptonian Labrador Retriever named Krypto, who goes by the name Bark Kent in everyday life. Krypto feels jealous when Superman starts dating Lois Lane, so Superman goes to an animal shelter to find Krypto a friend. A Boxer named Ace tries to escape the shelter, but Krypto stops him. Later, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy, LexCorp CEO Lex Luthor, reeling in a meteor strapped with orange kryptonite with a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers. He is easily defeated as the two are aided by the Justice League, formed by Superman himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and Aquaman.",
        "Meanwhile, Lulu, a guinea pig test subject from LexCorp sent to the shelter, reels in a piece of orange kryptonite with her own tractor beam, which gives her flight and telekinesis. Unbeknownst to her, everyone else in the shelter also gains superpowers. Ace is now super-strong and indestructible; PB, a potbellied pig, can change size; Merton, a nearsighted turtle, becomes super-fast; and Chip, a paranoid squirrel, gains electrokinesis. While at home, Superman and Krypto have an argument when the former plans to propose marriage to Lois. However, Clark is captured by Lulu. Krypto tries to save him, but loses his powers after eating some green kryptonite hidden inside a piece of Jarlsberg cheese. Later, Krypto comes across the shelter pets, who agree to help him.",
        "Meanwhile, Lulu recruits a group of guinea pigs, captures the Justice League, and heads to Stryker's Island to free Luthor. The shelter pets try to stop her, but fail miserably; in the process, Lulu taunts Krypto about Clark's engagement plans and even shows him the engagement ring. They regroup in the Hall of Justice, where Ace tells a distraught Krypto he used to be the puppy of a family with a toddler. One day, the toddler nearly fell down the stairs when Ace bit her arm and pulled her to safety. Upon seeing the bite-marks, the parents assumed Ace attacked her and sent him to the shelter. However, Ace stands by his actions and ideals. Encouraged, Krypto leads the pets to LexCorp. While there, a kitten named Whiskers, who Lulu rescued from the shelter and can now create weapons at will, attacks them, but the team traps her. At Stryker's Island, the shelter pets confront Lulu, but put themselves in prison cells when she threatens to kill Krypto. Lulu frees Luthor, who betrays her and locks her in his cell while freeing Mercy Graves. Lulu breaks out easily and decides to destroy the Justice League and Luthor herself.",
        "The Kryptonite passes through Krypto's system, restoring his powers. He breaks himself and the other super pets out of prison, and attempts to free the Justice League, but Lulu launches them into space, along with Luthor. In order to stall Krypto, she attempts to kill Lois. However, the other super pets rescue the Justice League while Krypto saves Lois and defeats Lulu, but she absorbs the orange kryptonite, becoming a mutated kaiju-sized version of herself. The League and the pets team up to stop her. Realizing she has become too powerful, Krypto decides to use the \"Solar Paw Punch\", a move that can defeat any supervillain, but will likely kill the user. The attack causes a massive explosion that removes the kryptonite from Lulu's brain and, shortly thereafter, her redeemed henchmen, Mark and Keith, trap her in a hot dog stand. Krypto accepts his fate, but Ace uses his invulnerability to save him.",
        "In the aftermath, Krypto allows Clark to marry Lois. The shelter pets, Mark, and Keith get adopted by the rest of the Justice League: Ace by Batman, PB by Wonder Woman, Merton by The Flash, Chip by Green Lantern, Mark by Cyborg and Keith by Aquaman. Sometime later, the pets have formed their own superhero team called the \"League of Super-Pets\".",
        "In a mid-credits scene, Luthor is still trapped in his prison asking any passing super-animals to free him, without success. Meanwhile, Lulu is freed by Mercy, who adopts her. In a post-credits scene, Krypto and Superman encounter Black Adam and his dog, Anubis. Krypto tricks them into flying to Pluto."

        "In July 2018, Jared Stern was hired to write and direct an animated film about DC's Legion of Super-Pets. In January 2019, it was announced that Sam J. Levine would serve as co-director with Stern, and that Patricia Hicks had signed on as producer. The film was pitched by Stern in 2012, during the early days of the Warner Animation Group.",
        "In May 2021, it was announced that Dwayne Johnson would star as the voice of Krypto the Superdog. In addition to starring in the film, he, alongside Dany Garcia, Hiram Garcia, and Stern would be joining Hicks as producers; while John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, and Nicholas Stoller were set to executive produce.",
        "In June 2021, additional cast members were announced, with Kevin Hart starring as the voice of Ace the Bat-Hound in the film. Additionally, Kate McKinnon, John Krasinski, Vanessa Bayer, Natasha Lyonne, Diego Luna, and Keanu Reeves were cast in undisclosed roles. The following week, Jameela Jamil joined the film. By September 2021, Marc Maron had joined the cast as the voice of Lex Luthor. By November of the same year, additional roles were revealed to be: Chip, Green Lantern's squirrel (Luna); Merton, The Flash's turtle (Lyonne); PB, Wonder Woman's pig (Bayer), Superman (Krasinski) and newer additions, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz. In March 2022, Reeves was revealed to be voicing Batman. The following month, it was revealed that Dascha Polanco would be voicing Jessica Cruz / Green Lantern. Three weeks before the film's release, the remainder of the cast for the Justice League and Lois Lane were announced in July 2022 through posters.",
        "Stern developed a pitch for the film after working in an animal shelter, where he noticed how older animals were less likely to be adopted and wondered \"what if those pets got superpowers?\". Stern was originally unsure what DC characters he was allowed to incorporate in the film, though he added Luthor after the character was suggested by DC. This led to the concept of the villain, Lulu, being a guinea pig, as Stern felt \"guinea pigs are someone who would have a chip on their shoulder\" due to them being used as test subjects, and Lulu being Lex's test subject served as a parallel with Krypto and Superman's relationship.",
        "According to Stern, DC executives suggested adding satirical jokes regarding their properties, which Stern felt allowed the film to make fun of the characters while portraying them respectfully. Stern said the humor regarding DC characters was meant to be rooted in the film's focus on pets, such as portraying Superman as a dog owner or Batman as \"a guy who really could use a pet\". Early drafts for the movie had Ace in a more prominent role, but his role was changed to co-lead once the filmmakers concluded the focus for the film should be on Krypto's relationship with Superman.",
        "The animation was provided by Animal Logic in Sydney and Vancouver, which also provided animation for the Warner Animation Group's The Lego Movie series. Approximately 70 animators worked on the film. Animators worked on the film for 2 years, as well as an extra 3\u20134 months after the film's release date was delayed by a year.",
        "The film's art style was inspired by Art Deco architecture and illustrator J.C. Leyendecker, as well as the Art Deco style from the original Superman comics. Stern wanted the characters and environments to have both visible brushstrokes and \"chunky heroic shapes\". Character designers Mayumi Nose and Matt William\u00eas drew inspiration from the Superfriends animated series and Superman comics from the Silver Age of Comic Books for the designs of the characters, while still having a comedic edge to them.",
        "The artists aimed for the film's visuals to reflect the optimistic tone from the Superman comic books, while also being relatable and cartoonish. In order to accomplish this, they had the visuals to be mainly vertical and have a \"painted feel\". The artists were influenced by the Superman comics from the Golden Age of Comic Books, particularly in those comics' painting style.",
        "The film's original score was composed by Steve Jablonsky. The film's score album was released on July 29, 2022, by WaterTower Music. The Taylor Swift songs \"Message in a Bottle (Taylor's Version)\" and a re-recording of the song \"Bad Blood\", \"Bad Blood (Taylor's Version)\", are also featured in the film; along with other songs on the soundtrack, Queen\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d, Sturgill Simpson\u2019s \u201cSing Along\u201d, R.E.M.'s cover of \"Superman\", A Tribe Called Quest's \u201cElectric Relaxation\u201d, The Pharcyde\u2019s \"Passin' Me By\", Bill Beach's \"Tudo \u00c9 Relativo\", Europe\u2019s \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d, Percy Faith & His Orchestra\u2019s \u201cTheme from A Summer Place\u201d, Burt Bacharach\u2019s \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\", The Chemical Brothers\u2019 \u201cBlock Rockin\u2019 Beats\u201d and Canned Heat\u2019s \u201cLet's Work Together.\u201d",
        "Also included is the original ballad \"Count On Me\", written and produced by Jeremy Silver and performed by Jac Ross.  The song plays during an emotional flashback montage sequence where Ace used to have an idyllic home life with a family.",
        "The soundtrack intermittently features themes of other superhero films from John Williams' \"Theme from Superman (Main Title)\", Danny Elfman\u2019s \u201cBatman Theme (Main Title)\u201d to Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman Theme\u201d from the popular 1970s television series and one other cinematic soundtrack song, Charles Bernstein's \"Jump Rope\" from A Nightmare on Elm Street, as sung by Whiskers as she hunts down the Super-Pets in a dead-end street."

        "In January 2019, the film was scheduled to be released on May 21, 2021. The release date was later pushed back to May 20, 2022, in favour of The Matrix Resurrections, another WB film starring Reeves. It was then pushed back to July 29, 2022 (taking the release of Black Adam, which also stars Johnson), among other films from Warner Bros. getting pushed due to production delays. DC League of Super-Pets premiered in Los Angeles on July 27, 2022. This was the final production under the name Warner Animation Group before the studio's rebranding in June 2023.",

        "Nell Minow writing for RogerEbert.com praised the \"lively\" voice talent, and called the script \"smart, exciting, and very funny\". Reviewer Dwight Brown wrote, \"It doesn't break the mold. However, it is sly, wicked and so much fun. Kids will laugh at the antics. Adults will chuckle when they hear the puns, jokes, catty remarks and doggy banter.\" Peter Travers of ABC News wrote that while the movie \"is not a revolution in animation. It gets the fun done for family audiences.\" Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent criticized its \"limited imagination\", adding: \"The film is desperately craving an angle\u2014one that certainly can't be fulfilled by the fact all the pet ownership jokes have already been used up by the Secret Life of Pets series.\""
