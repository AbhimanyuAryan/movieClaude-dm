It is the fourth and final installment in the Hotel Transylvania franchise and the sequel to Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (2018), the film was directed by Derek Drymon and Jennifer Kluska (in their respective feature-length directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Amos Vernon, Nunzio Randazzo and Genndy Tartakovsky. It stars the voices of Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez (who also served as an executive producer alongside Tartakovsky and Michelle Murdocca), Kathryn Hahn, Jim Gaffigan, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, Keegan-Michael Key, Brian Hull, Fran Drescher, Brad Abrell, Asher Blinkoff, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins and Zoe Berri. In the film, Dracula and Johnny (Hull and Samberg) team up to find a crystal in South America to turn themselves back into their old selves, before their transformations become permanent.\nPlans for a fourth Hotel Transylvania film begin in February 2019 and was announced to be released on December 22, 2021. Returning and new cast and crew members were announced soon after, and Mark Mothersbaugh, who composed the score for the first three installments, returned to score, in addition to original song performed by Yendry. Production took place remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally planned to be released theatrically in the United States on October 1, 2021, Sony Pictures Releasing cancelled the film's release plans and sold the film's distribution rights to Amazon Studios for $100\u00a0million, due to rising cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in the United States.\nHotel Transylvania: Transformania was released exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on January 14, 2022, and theatrically in China on April 3. The film received mixed reviews from critics with the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus calling it \"middling family viewing -- relatively painless, but overall rather uninspired\".\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nDuring Hotel Transylvania's 125th anniversary celebration, Dracula is planning to retire and leave the hotel to Mavis and Johnny. Mavis overhears this and tells Johnny who excitedly tells Dracula his plans to renovate the hotel. Worried about Johnny ruining the hotel, Dracula lies to him saying that there is a \"monster real-estate law\" which only lets monsters own the hotel and instead falsely announces the expansion of the hotel with an extra bathroom, disappointing Johnny, Mavis and the others in the process.\nVan Helsing decides to help Johnny using a ray that turns humans into monsters and vice versa. After testing it on his guinea pig Gigi, he uses it on Johnny who turns into a dragon-like monster. Learning about Johnny's monster form, Dracula tries to turn him back to normal, but accidentally turns himself into a human and breaks the ray's crystal. Van Helsing tells Dracula and Johnny that they can still turn themselves back to normal by getting a new crystal which lies in the Cave of the Reflexi\u00f3n in South America, so Dracula and Johnny set off to do so.\nDracula's friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin and Murray end up becoming humans as well, as a result of drinking from a fountain that was contaminated by the ray. After learning about Dracula and Johnny's whereabouts on the news, Mavis and Ericka confront Van Helsing, but they are attacked by Gigi, where Van Helsing discovers that the effects of the ray are unstable, as the monster transformation will keep mutating until the subject becomes a mindless beast. With this in mind, the rest of the gang head to South America to find Dracula and Johnny.\nWhile traveling through the South American jungle, Dracula and Johnny begin to bond, and Dracula eventually begins to confess that he lied about the monster real-estate law and the hotel's expansion, but the rest of the group finds them in the middle of the confession. Things turn sour when Dracula admits his deception regarding passing over the hotel to Mavis and Johnny. This prompts an upset Johnny to believe Dracula does not consider him family and to mutate further before running away.\nMavis goes to find Johnny while Dracula and the rest of the gang go to the Cave of the Reflexi\u00f3n. Mavis finds Johnny, but the transformation has turned him very volatile. She leads him to the cave where they finally find the crystal. When Mavis tries to turn Johnny back to normal, nothing happens due to him being too frenzied. In desperation, Dracula lets himself get captured by Johnny and makes a remorseful speech about how wrong he was about Johnny and how he now sees the best in him, finally acknowledging him as family. This brings Johnny back to his senses, and he is returned to normal.\nWith Dracula and his friends turned back to normal, they return home only to find the hotel has been destroyed by Gigi. After turning Gigi back to normal, Dracula decides to let Mavis and Johnny rebuild the hotel to their liking. One year later, Mavis and Johnny re-built and modernized the hotel, which Dracula comes to enjoy.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nMain article: List of Hotel Transylvania characters\nAndy Samberg as Jonathan \"Johnny\" Loughran, Mavis' husband, Dracula's son-in-law, Ericka's stepson-in-law and Dennis' father[5]\nSelena Gomez as Mavis Dracula, Johnny's wife, Dracula's daughter, Ericka's stepdaughter and Dennis' mother[5]\nVictoria Gomez voices a young Mavis Dracula\nKathryn Hahn as Ericka Van Helsing, Dracula's wife, Mavis' stepmother, Johnny's stepmother-in-law, Dennis' step-grandmother and the great-granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing[5]\nJim Gaffigan as Professor Abraham Van Helsing, a former monster hunter, Dracula's great-grandfather-in-law and ex-nemesis and Ericka's great-grandfather who invented the \"Monsterfication Ray\"[5]\nSteve Buscemi as Wayne, a werewolf and Wanda's husband[5]\nMolly Shannon as Wanda, a werewolf and Wayne's wife[5]\nDavid Spade as Griffin, an invisible man[5]\nKeegan-Michael Key as Murray, an ancient mummy[5]\nBrian Hull as Count \"Drac\" Dracula, the founder of Hotel Transylvania and Mavis' father, Johnny's father-in-law, Dennis' maternal grandfather and Ericka's husband.

The website's consensus reads: \"Much like the trio of films it follows, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is middling family viewing -- relatively painless, but overall rather uninspired.\"[34] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[35]\nMeagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting rates it 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing \"Hotel Transylvania: Transformania never gets as complex as its moral center suggests, therefore never really rising above a wholesome, exuberant amusement ride.\"[36] Tomris Laffly of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing, \"The result is yet another wearisome tale that inelegantly depicts themes like acceptance, understanding and diversity within a saga that has always been rather clumsy with its messaging around such weighty topics.\"[37] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Never much to write home about in the script department \u2014 Tartakovsky excels in more stylish, less verbal fare like Samurai Jack \u2014 Transformania remains sufficiently goofy-sweet to please its target demo; those who find the humor toothless should at least appreciate the distinctive animation, which can be as energetically wacky as classic Looney Tunes.\"[38]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nThe film was nominated in two categories for \"Outstanding Special Class Animated Program\" and \"Outstanding Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for an Animated Program\" at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards.[39] At the 2023 Kids' Choice Awards, Selena Gomez won the award for \"Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie (Female)\".[40]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Billington, Alex (May 17, 2021). \"Goofy First Trailer for Sequel 'Hotel Transylvania 4: Transformania'\".
