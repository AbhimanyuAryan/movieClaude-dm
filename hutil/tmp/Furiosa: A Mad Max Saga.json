        "Director George Miller and co-writer Nick Lauthoris spent over 15 years writing the script for Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), and developed backstories for every character, particularly focusing on protagonist Imperator Furiosa. This eventually culminated in a screenplay centered around Furiosa, which actress Charlize Theron, who portrayed Furiosa in Fury Road, used as reference for her performance in the film. By May 2020, Miller planned to develop a prequel Furiosa film after completing his other film Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022). At the same time, he also began the casting process for the role after resolving legal disputes with distributor Warner Bros. Pictures regarding unpaid earnings. Miller sought to cast a younger actress for the role rather than using de-aging technology for Theron. The setting of the film occurs across a timeframe of 15 years, depicting Furiosa's backstory of how she was displaced from her home and spent her life \"trying to get back\".",
        "In March 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdown, Miller used Skype to conduct casting auditions for the title role of Furiosa. He chose Taylor-Joy after seeing her performance in an early cut of the film Last Night in Soho and auditioning her with the \"Mad as Hell\" monologue from Sidney Lumet's Network. Taylor-Joy received advice from Nicholas Hoult, who had previously portrayed Nux in Fury Road. Tom Burke joined the cast in autumn of 2021, replacing Yahya Abdul-Mateen II for the same role due to a scheduling conflict. Multiple Fury Road crew members agreed to return for the film, including film editor Margaret Sixel, production designer Colin Gibson, composer Junkie XL, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt.",
        "In January 2022, it was reported that Simon Duggan would be serving as cinematographer. In June 2022, it was reported Nathan Jones and Angus Sampson were set to reprise their roles from Fury Road. In August, Quaden Bayles, who worked on Miller's Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022) after a video about his mistreatment at school went viral, was announced to be appearing in Furiosa, in a small role.",
        "After multiple different dates were reported for the start of filming, Deadline Hollywood confirmed in a May 2022 interview with Miller that second unit filming was underway in Australia in advance of principal photography. The film was awarded a AU$175 million filming incentive, and spent a total of US$233 million (AU$343.2 million) in Australia, the most-ever for a film production in the country. Hemsworth stated that Miller had hired ex-convicts as supporting artists for the film. In May 2022, second unit filming moved to Hay with more scheduled to take place in Silverton. Principal photography began on 1 June 2022, in Australia, and was expected to wrap by September. Filming officially wrapped by October 2022.",
        "In March 2024, it was revealed that Lachy Hulme would portray a younger Immortan Joe in the film, taking over the role from Hugh Keays-Byrne, who had since died in 2020 after portraying him in Mad Max: Fury Road."
