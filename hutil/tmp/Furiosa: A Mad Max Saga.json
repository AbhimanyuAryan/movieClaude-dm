It is the fifth installment in the Mad Max franchise, serving as both a spin-off and prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). The film stars Anya Taylor-Joy as the titular character Imperator Furiosa, with Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, and Alyla Browne also starring.\nIn March 2020, Miller conducted casting auditions for the title role of the film. In October, Taylor-Joy, Hemsworth and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II were cast in starring roles, but due to a scheduling conflict, Abdul-Mateen was replaced by Burke in November. Several crew members from Fury Road returned for the film, including screenwriter Lathouris, film editor Margaret Sixel, costume designer Jenny Beavan, and composer Tom Holkenborg. Principal photography took place in Australia from June to October 2022.\nFuriosa will have its world premiere at the 77th Cannes Film Festival on 15 May 2024, and is scheduled to be released in theatres in Australia by Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures on 23 May 2024, and in the United States the following day.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nSet 15 to 20 years before the events of Mad Max: Fury Road, as the world falls apart, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and into the hands of a  Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus. While two Tyrants war for dominance over the Citadel, Furiosa survives many trials as she plots a way back home through the Wasteland.[1]\n\nCast[edit]\nAnya Taylor-Joy as Imperator Furiosa\nAlyla Browne as young Furiosa\nChris Hemsworth as Warlord Dementus\nTom Burke as Praetorian Jack[2]\nLachy Hulme as Immortan Joe / Rizzdale Pell\nNathan Jones as Rictus Erectus\nJohn Howard as The People Eater\nAngus Sampson as The Organic Mechanic\nCharlee Fraser as Mary Jo Bassa, Furiosa's mother[3]\nQuaden Bayles\nDaniel Webber as War Boy\nProduction[edit]\nPre-production[edit]\nDirector George Miller and co-writer Nick Lauthoris spent over 15 years writing the script for Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), and developed backstories for every character, particularly focusing on protagonist Imperator Furiosa.[4] This eventually culminated in a screenplay centered around Furiosa, which actress Charlize Theron, who portrayed Furiosa in Fury Road, used as reference for her performance in the film.[5] In July 2010, Miller announced plans to shoot Fury Road back-to-back with a prequel film entitled Mad Max: Furiosa but it was decided to only shoot the former during pre-production.[6] In November 2017, Miller's production company filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over unpaid salaries which delayed the production of any additional entires in the franchise.[7] In July 2019, Miller revealed that a Furiosa film was still being planned in addition to two Mad Max sequels.[8]\nBy May 2020, Miller planned to develop a prequel Furiosa film after completing his other film Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022). At the same time, he also began the casting process for the role after resolving legal disputes with Warner Bros. Miller sought to cast a younger actress for the role rather than using de-aging technology for Theron.[4] The setting of the film occurs across a timeframe of 15 years, depicting Furiosa's backstory of how she was displaced from her home and spent her life \"trying to get back\".[5]\nIn March 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdown, Miller used Skype to conduct casting auditions for the title role of Furiosa.[9] He chose Taylor-Joy after seeing her performance in an early cut of the film Last Night in Soho and auditioning her with the \"Mad as Hell\" monologue from Sidney Lumet's Network.[10] Taylor-Joy received advice from Nicholas Hoult, who had previously portrayed Nux in Fury Road.[11][12] Tom Burke joined the cast in autumn of 2021, replacing Yahya Abdul-Mateen II for the same role due to a scheduling conflict.[13] Multiple Fury Road crew members agreed to return for the film, including film editor Margaret Sixel, production designer Colin Gibson,[14] composer Junkie XL, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt.[15][16][17]\nIn January 2022, it was reported that Simon Duggan would be serving as cinematographer.[18] In June 2022, it was reported Nathan Jones and Angus Sampson were set to reprise their roles from Fury Road.[19] In August, Quaden Bayles, who worked on Miller's Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022) after a video about his mistreatment at school went viral, was announced to be appearing in Furiosa, in a small role.[20]\n\nFilming[edit]\nFuriosa was shot in the New South Wales towns of Hay (left) and Silverton (right), which is often considered a ghost town,[21] though it has a small population of 48 people.\nAfter multiple different dates were reported for the start of filming, Deadline Hollywood confirmed in a May 2022 interview with Miller that second unit filming was underway in Australia in advance of principal photography.[22] The film was awarded a AU$175 million filming incentive,[23] and spent a total of US$233 million (AU$343.2 million) in Australia, the most-ever for a film production in the country.[24] Hemsworth stated that Miller had hired ex-convicts as supporting artists for the film.[25] In May 2022, second unit filming moved to Hay with more scheduled to take place in Silverton.[26] Principal photography began on 1 June 2022, in Australia, and was expected to wrap by September.[27][28] Filming officially wrapped by October 2022.[29]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nIn March 2024, it was revealed that Lachy Hulme would portray a younger Immortan Joe in the film,[30] taking over the role from Hugh Keays-Byrne, who had since died in 2020 after portraying him in Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nRelease[edit]\nFuriosa is scheduled to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on 15 May 2024,[31] and is scheduled to be released theatrically in Australia on 23 May 2024, and in the United States on 24 May 2024, by Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures.[32] It was originally scheduled to be released on 23 June 2023.[33]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"'Furiosa': Release Date, Cast, Plot, and Everything We Know So Far\".
