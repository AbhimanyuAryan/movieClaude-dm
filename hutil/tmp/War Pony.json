The website's consensus reads: \"With subtlety and authenticity, War Pony tracks the lives of two young Indigenous men and cements the two women behind the lens, Riley Keough and Gina Gammell, as talents to watch.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"War Pony (15)\".
