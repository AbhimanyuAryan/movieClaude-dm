        "The film was director Luke Eve's first feature film. He researched the mental health issues it portrays thoroughly, and consulted the mental health organisation SANE about the script. He described the film as \"not a hard hitting portrayal of mental illness. It's about somebody with schizophrenia, but wrapped up in a fantastical love story\".",
        "After being filmed in Australia, the film's festival and theatre release schedule was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "Reception": [
        "Roger Moore of Movie Nation gave the film a 2/4 and said \"The best one can say for the script is that it gives the charming stars a nice moment or two, and that it generally doesn't fall for the \"Love can cure what ails you\" mental health rom-com trap.\" John Nolan of Punch Drunk Critics scored the film 2.5/5 stars, stating \"While new ground isn't exactly broken I Met A Girl does an admirable job delivering exactly what fans of this emerging sub-genre are looking for while being respectful of the struggles faced by it's [sic] protagonist.\"",
        "ScreenHub Australia gave the film 3.5/5 stars. Andrew F. Peirce of The Curb praised Thwaites' performance, and called the film \"a proudly grounded, human experience... that lingers longer in your mind than the possible light rom-com filmic creation that the base synopsis would suggest\"."
