        "The film was shot in the state of Georgia, beginning in April 2021. White Elephant is one of the last films to star Bruce Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. Director Jesse V. Johnson, who previously worked with Willis when he himself was a stuntman, told the Los Angeles Times that \"it was clear that he was not the Bruce I remembered\". Willis's lines were filmed at a quicker pace at the suggestion of his assistant, Stephen J. Eads. Several crew members recalled Willis appearing confused on set. One of the crew members said, \"It was less of an annoyance and more like: 'How do we not make Bruce look bad?'. Someone would give him a line and he didn't understand what it meant. He was just being puppeted.\" Production supervisor Terri Martin said, \"He just looked so lost, and he would say, 'I'll do my best.' He always tried his best.\" Johnson would later be asked if he wanted to film another movie with Willis but the director declined the offer, stating, \"it was decided as a team that we would not do another. We are all Bruce Willis fans, and the arrangement felt wrong and ultimately a rather sad end to an incredible career, one that none of us felt comfortable with.\""
