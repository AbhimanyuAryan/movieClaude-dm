    "Plot": [
        "Ray, who operates his family-owned hardware store with his brother Junior in a small Texas town, gets from private detective Skip several photographs, taken by chance during a stake-out at a local motel, which indicate his wife Stacy-Lynn's marital infidelity. Distraught, Ray buys a revolver from a gun shop and drives to that motel. While Ray is contemplating suicide, a stranger gets into his car, apparently mistaking Ray for contract killer Harry, who is expected to meet him at the same motel around that time. The stranger hands over to Ray several thousand dollars as half the payment for somebody's assassination, which must be done next day, and leaves him, with a street address on piece of paper amongst the banknotes the only clue as to the target's identity. Harry arrives as Ray drives off. Still refusing to accept that there's anything the matter with his marriage, Ray is inclined to keep the contract money for financing a beauty salon which Stacy-Lynn wants to open; without a clear idea how to carry out a contract killing, he drives to the address and follows the man living there to a bar so clumsily that he's promptly \"rumbled\". The man forces Ray into his car, where a scuffle quickly develops between them and Ray shoots his opponent dead with the revolver. He dumps the corpse by the roadside, dropping accidentally one of Skip's photographs of Stacy-Lynn next to the body. On his way home he finds out from Junior's wife that the person Stacy-Lynn has been having an affair with is his brother (though he doesn't want to give much credence to that revelation).",
        "Police establish that the killed man is a local lawyer James Barlow, the photo of Ray's wife discovered near Barlow's body makes them suspect her of involvement in his murder. The man who mistook Ray for a hitman finds him at work in the store and tells him that last night he broke into Barlow's office and there was no money in the safe there - he accuses Ray of stealing a large sum out of Barlow's safe, and gives Ray one day to return the stolen money. Ray and Skip visit Barlow's office and find out that Barlow was engaged in a blackmailing case for his client Adam Ledoux, who runs a large car dealership in the town.",
        "In the meantime, Harry locates the bar from which he was called on his mobile phone to make arrangements for a hit on Barlow, and he finds out which waitress could help him with his further inquiries. Ledoux informs Skip and Ray that Barlow was handling the payout of $250,000 for him and his wife to the blackmailer in order to keep the reputation of their dealership as a family-oriented business unsullied by disclosures of Ledoux's philandering. Later Ledoux's wife tells Skip and Ray about Ledoux's gambling addiction and that the payout money was actually hers. Harry pays the waitress from the bar a visit and finds out that it was her boyfriend who put a contract on Barlow in order to get at the payout money; Harry tortures the boyfriend for information and kills him before leaving the waitress alone. Ray recollects that Barlow had a briefcase with him when he was following him, but he didn't it take it into the bar, so it must have been left in Barlow's car, which was towed away on the night when Ray shot Barlow. Skip and Ray locate the car and find the case with money inside it - however, Ray then forces Skip at gunpoint to give it to him, because he still hopes that financing Stacy-Lynn's beauty parlour with that money will put their marriage back on the even keel. When Ray arrives home, Stacy-Lynn and Junior turn him in to the police straightaway (although keeping the briefcase with money to themselves).",
        "Harry ambushes the police vehicle transporting Ray en route to the county jail and shoots dead both of the policemen, during the shootout Ray manages to escape unobserved. When he gets to Junior's house, his brother's wife tells Ray that Junior has left her for Stacy-Lynn and that he has been embezzling money from their hardware store for years. Harry takes Skip captive at gunpoint and calls Ray from Skip's mobile phone, demanding that the money be returned to him. Ray spots his brother's car parked at a motel and finds his wife and Junior in the shower - he shoots his brother dead and announces to Stacy-Lynn that he wants a divorce. When Harry arrives with Skip at the motel, Ray demands that Skip be released first. After exchanging fire with Harry, Ray convinces Skip to take the case with money and leave without him. With both men facing off in a small motel room with their firearms at the ready, Ray asks if Harry would be willing to leave town on Ray's letting him go - Harry declines saying that it's more important to finish the started things. Both of them then fatally injure each other with abdominal gunshot wounds.",
        "The film ends with Skip's stopping his car reluctantly to offer Stacy-Lynn a lift and her hesitantly accepting his offer."
