    "Plot": [
        "Apokoliptian warlord Darkseid and his Parademons attempt to invade Earth using the combined energies of the three Mother Boxes. Darkseid is foiled by a unified alliance of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humanity, and extraterrestrial beings. The Mother Boxes are then separated and hidden in different locations. Millennia later, Superman's death following the battle with Doomsday reactivates the Boxes, attracting Steppenwolf, Darkseid's disgraced lieutenant. Steppenwolf aims to regain Darkseid's favor by gathering the Boxes to form \"The Unity\", which would terraform Earth into a copy of their homeworld.",
        "Steppenwolf reaches Themyscira through a portal and fights to obtain the Amazons' Mother Box. Diana Prince informs Bruce Wayne, as the two seek to form a team of metahumans to protect the planet. After failing to recruit Arthur Curry, Bruce locates Barry Allen, who enthusiastically joins. Diana locates Victor Stone, who joins after his father, Silas, and other S.T.A.R. Labs employees are kidnapped by Parademons seeking humanity's Mother Box. Steppenwolf kills Atlantean guards and takes their Mother Box, forcing Arthur to join the group. Victor retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden. He reveals it was used to rebuild his body after a car accident, explaining that the Boxes can rearrange matter. The group realizes they could resurrect Superman using the box. Meanwhile, Steppenwolf receives a vision of the Anti-Life Equation on Earth, a secret power sought by Darkseid to control all of existence.",
        "The team exhumes Clark Kent's body and places it in a Kryptonian ship. They successfully resurrect him, but Clark forgets his memories and begins attacking the group. Lois Lane arrives and placates him, then takes him to Clark's family home in Smallville, allowing him to regain his memories. Steppenwolf retrieves the last Mother Box, but Victor's father sacrifices himself to supercharge it with laser heat, allowing Victor to track it. Without Superman, the five heroes travel to an abandoned Russian city called Pozharnov, where Steppenwolf aims to form the Unity.",
        "They fight their way through the surrounding Parademons, with Superman arriving in time to subdue Steppenwolf. However, Victor fails to prevent the Unity and the planet begins to be destroyed. Thus, Barry enters the Speed Force, reversing time and providing Victor the necessary charge, allowing him and Superman to prevent the Unity. Working together, the team kills Steppenwolf. Darkseid vows to return to Earth to find the Anti-Life Equation. In the aftermath, Bruce and Diana make plans to set up a base of operations for the newly formed alliance at the desolated Wayne Manor. Clark resumes his double life in Metropolis. Arthur meets with Vulko and Mera before going to see his father, and Barry informs his erroneously convicted father in prison that he has acquired a job in Central City's police department. Victor is inspired by a message left by his father to realize his purpose in life.",
        "Later, Lex Luthor, who has escaped from Arkham Asylum, is visited on his yacht by Slade Wilson, to whom he reveals Batman's secret identity while Bruce awakes from an apocalyptic dream of the future, in which his ragtag resistance troop is hunted by a mind-controlled Superman, and receives a visit from the Martian Manhunter, who promises to help prepare for Darkseid's return."

    "Cast": [
        "Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman: A wealthy socialite, the owner of Wayne Enterprises, and co-founder of the Justice League. He dedicates himself to protecting Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a highly trained, masked vigilante equipped with various tools and weapons. Director Zack Snyder described Affleck's Batman as on a path of redemption in Zack Snyder's Justice League, feeling guilty due to his actions in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016).",
        "Henry Cavill as Clark Kent / Superman: A Kryptonian survivor with superpowers and a journalist for the Daily Planet based in Metropolis. He is the inspiration for the Justice League, which he becomes a member of. In 2018, Cavill described Superman as he appears in Snyder's Justice League as coming closer to completing his character arc that began with Man of Steel (2013) and becoming the \"true\" Superman as depicted in the comics. Snyder said while he loves the traditional portrayals of the character, he wanted Superman to have a realistic arc and develop as a character, and not be a \"one-dimensional Boy Scout\".",
        "Amy Adams as Lois Lane: A reporter for the Daily Planet and the love interest of Clark Kent.",
        "Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman: An immortal demigoddess princess and Amazon warrior. She is a co-founder of the Justice League.",
        "Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg: A former college athlete who, after being cybernetically reconstructed after a nearly fatal car accident, is turned into a techno-organic being enhanced by reactive, adaptive biomimetic alien technology. His enhancements include the abilities of flight, variable weaponry and technopathy. Much of Cyborg's character development was removed in the theatrical release, and Snyder described Cyborg as he is depicted in Zack Snyder's Justice League as \"the heart of the movie\". Similarly, Fisher stated that Cyborg's character arc is emotional and allegorical of \"the journey that Black people have taken in [America]\". According to Fisher, the only scene of his directed by Snyder which remained in the theatrical release was that of Cyborg meeting up with Batman and Commissioner Gordon at the Gotham City police rooftop.",
        "Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman: An Atlantean half-blood with aquatic powers.",
        "Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash:A Central City college student pursuing a degree in criminal justice in the hopes of exonerating his father of the murder of his wife, Barry's mother. He is capable of moving at superhuman speeds and entering the Speed Force to time-travel.",
        "Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko: An Atlantean who acts as Arthur's mentor.",
        "Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor:Superman's archenemy and former head of LexCorp. Luthor's appearance at the end of the film was originally intended to tease Affleck's now-reworked The Batman project rather than a potential Justice League sequel.",
        "Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth: Bruce Wayne's butler who provides tactical support for Batman and the Justice League.",
        "Diane Lane as Martha Kent: Clark Kent's adoptive mother.",
        "Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta: Diana's mother and Queen of the Amazons.",
        "J. K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon: The Gotham City police commissioner and an ally of Batman.",
        "Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Steppenwolf:A New God military officer from the planet Apokolips who leads an army of Parademons in search of the three Mother Boxes held on Earth. Hinds had previously described Steppenwolf as \"old, tired, still trying to get out of his own enslavement to Darkseid\". Steppenwolf was redesigned for the new release, bringing his appearance closer to Snyder's original vision.",
        "Zheng Kai as Ryan Choi: A scientist working at S.T.A.R. Labs, under the leadership of Silas Stone. By the end of the film, Choi is promoted to Director of Nanotechnology at the company. The character was intended to star in a spin-off, with Snyder having pitched a film to the studio, which would have featured Choi taking up the mantle of The Atom, and taken place in China with a Chinese cast.",
        "Amber Heard as Mera: An Atlantean who was raised by Arthur Curry's mother, Queen Atlanna. Unlike her appearances in the theatrical version and Aquaman (2018), Heard uses a pseudo-Queen's English accent throughout the film.",
        "Joe Morton as Silas Stone: Victor Stone's father and the head scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs.",
        "Lisa Loven Kongsli as Menalippe: Hippolyta's lieutenant and Diana's aunt.",
        "David Thewlis as Ares: The God of War and son of the Olympian Old God Zeus and the half-brother of Diana Prince. Stuntman Nick McKinless portrays Ares physically, while Thewlis's face is superimposed on McKinless's using CGI.",
        "Ray Porter portrays Darkseid, a tyrannical New God from Apokolips and Steppenwolf's master. Darkseid did not appear in the theatrical release, meaning Zack Snyder's Justice League marks the character's first appearance in a live-action film. Porter played Darkseid through the use of motion capture and \"went through a few different vocal gymnastics trying to figure out the voice\". Porter was unfamiliar with the Darkseid character upon being cast, but Snyder and screenwriter Chris Terrio helped guide him with their knowledge of the comic book lore. Peter Guinness portrays DeSaad, Darkseid's master enforcer, who acts as a liaison between Steppenwolf and Darkseid.",
        "Harry Lennix reprises his DCEU role as US Secretary of Defense Calvin Swanwick, whose real identity is revealed as Martian Manhunter. Snyder stated that Swanwick has always been the Martian Manhunter since Man of Steel and has secretly been guiding Clark, Lois, and mankind to do good as he wanted humanity to try and protect Earth themselves before getting directly involved. Jared Leto reprises his role from Suicide Squad (2016) as the Joker, a psychotic criminal and Batman's archenemy, who becomes one of the surviving resistance members in the Knightmare future. The Joker was not planned to appear in the original film, but Snyder decided to use him sometime after his new version was greenlit, as it was always Snyder's intention to bring the Joker into his Justice League films. The character was redesigned for the new release.",
        "Karen Bryson portrays Elinor Stone, Victor Stone's late mother, while Kiersey Clemons portrays Iris West, Barry Allen's future love interest; both actresses' scenes were cut from the theatrical release and restored for Snyder's version of the film. Other actors reprising their roles from previous DC Extended Universe films include: Eleanor Matsuura as Epione, Samantha Jo (who also played the Kryptonian Car-Vex in Man of Steel) as Euboea, Ann Ogbomo as Philippus, Doutzen Kroes as Venelia, Carla Gugino as the Kryptonian ship's voice. Uncredited appearances include Robin Wright as Antiope, Billy Crudup as Henry Allen, Kevin Costner (via archival voice recording and still photograph) as Jonathan Kent, Joe Manganiello as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke and Russell Crowe as Jor-El. In addition to Thewlis and McKinless portraying Ares, Sergi Constance and Aurore Lauzeral portray the roles of other Old Gods, Zeus and Artemis, respectively. Julian Lewis Jones and Francis Magee portray two ancient kings of Earth, credited as the Ancient Atlantean king and the Ancient king of men, respectively. Michael McElhatton appears as Black Clad Alpha, the leader of a group of terrorists who clash with Wonder Woman early in the film. Marc McClure (who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the original Superman film series) has a brief cameo as Jerry, a police officer who is friends with Lois Lane. Green Lanterns Yalan Gur and Kilowog also appeared, as well as Granny Goodness through computer-generated imagery (CGI). The latter was modeled after the aunt of a Weta artist named Jojo Aguilar."

        "At the 2021 WarnerMedia Upfront, Warner Media declared the film was \"a hit\" Max original. Priya Dogra, president of WarnerMedia Entertainment Networks for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific stated the film to be a \"global phenomenon\" during a presentation for HBO Max Europe. According to Whip Media, who track viewership data for the 19 million worldwide users of their TV Time app, the film was the eighth most-streamed-film of 2021. In January 2022, tech firm Akami reported that the film was the second most pirated film of 2021. Variety stated that the film was the fourth most-streamed film of 2021.",

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 312 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Zack Snyder's Justice League lives up to its title with a sprawling cut that expands to fit the director's vision \u2013 and should satisfy the fans who willed it into existence.\" According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 46 critics, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\". The scores of the film are higher on both sites than what the 2017 film received (39% and 45, respectively).",
        "According to The Hollywood Reporter, critics praised Snyder's direction and characterization, but criticized the film's length. Variety later noted that most critics felt the film was superior to the 2017 version, a sentiment The Hollywood Reporter and TheWrap also agreed with. However, Total Film reported that critical response to the film was mixed, with critics being \"divided\" on whether or not it was superior to the theatrical version. Rob Harvilla of The Ringer felt that the film is \"A Zack Snyder film that 'critics enjoyed', or at least 'grudgingly appreciated'\". He further opined both fans and critics \"respect\" the film due to the nature of its existence.",
        "Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph awarded the film a full five stars, praising Holkenborg's score, action sequences, and characterization, which he felt was superior to the original. Collin went on to opine that Snyder's creative vision for the DCEU had felt unique. Jenna Anderson from ComicBook.com, who rated the film a 4.5 out of 5, also praised the increased characterization, performances, and Snyder's filmmaking techniques, believing Snyder created the film out of love for both his daughter and fans. She went on to describe it as being \"well-executed, entertaining story about the power of human connection and inspiration, one that feels both timeless and timely\". Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman enjoyed Snyder's direction, which he felt \"exudes a majestic sense of cosmic historical evil\", and compared it to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001\u20132003), in addition to highlighting the visuals and the characterization. Gleiberman and Variety's Peter Debruge later ranked it as the eighth best film of 2021. Matt Zoller Seitz from RogerEbert.com, who gave it a 3.5 out of 4, felt the film was superior to the theatrical version, and described Snyder's vision as being a \"brazen auteurist vision\". Though he felt many scenes were protracted, he also felt it was used to improve characterization and create a \"sense of space and place\".",
        "Tom Jorgensen of IGN gave the film an 8 out of 10 rating, calling it a \"vindication\" for Snyder's vision, and like Seitz, maintained that the extended runtime allowed the film to further develop its lore and characters. He particularly enjoyed the film's extended focus on characterization, writing \"Nearly every character in Zack Snyder's Justice League, from the top down, has a clearer journey and more dimension\". Mick LaSalle, for the San Francisco Chronicle, gave the film a positive review, writing that the increased runtime improved the characters, and emphasizing that it was superior to the theatrical version. He concluded that it \"may not be a great film, but it has the madness, strangeness and obsessiveness of a real work of art\". In a more critical review, Bilge Ebiri of Vulture wrote the film \"contains the best and worst of Zack Snyder\", noting its existence as being a personal endeavor for Snyder. Ebiri's opinion on Cyborg's character arc was mixed: he thought Cyborg's character consisted of \"broad, basic emotions\" but also felt it was the \"best stuff in the film\". He mainly criticized the action \u2013 feeling it was overreliant on computer-generated imagery (CGI) and slow motion \u2013 and story, calling it \"least interesting part\". Similarly, Eric Kohn at IndieWire graded the film a C, also reiterating that it \"undeniably represents the singular vision\" of Snyder. He disapproved of the runtime, believing it to lengthen a simple plot. Elaborating on his sentiment, he perceived the subplots as being \"cheesy\" and negatively compared the worldbuilding to that of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), though he approved of the cinematography, Cyborg's characterization, and added that the film offered \"occasional dashes of intrigue and inspired visual conceits\".",
        "The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore gave the film a negative review. Though he acknowledged that the plot, tone, and visual effects were superior to the theatrical version, he criticized the runtime and dialogue, opining that it \"largely maintains a testosterocious monotony from its first chapter\". Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody also disliked the runtime, deeming it to contain scenes \"chopped down to a bare informational minimum, leaving no room for thought or emotion\". Additionally, he disapproved of the visual effects and characterization, perceiving it as \"trivialization, manipulation, and deformation of the sincere and serious emotions that undergird and motivate its cast of heroes\". While Richard Trenholm, writing for CNET, praised the performances, he described the film as being \"bloated\", feeling that there was many redundant scenes and perceived the tone to be overly serious. In a 1.5/4 star review for The New York Observer, Siddhant Adlakha wrote that \"the film's improvements are hardly enough to fix what was, now quite apparently, a flawed endeavor from the start\", appreciating the \"mythic approach\" Snyder had given the characters and felt that the use of slow-motion help give the film a \"dreamy prelude\", while also noting the extensive runtime dedicated to exposition. However, he criticized the overall narrative, believing the conflict to be underdeveloped and disliking Steppenwolf's characterization, but he enjoyed Cyborg's characterization and desired the film to further explore his story. Hannah Strong of Little White Lies gave a 2 out of 5 rating, concluding that it \"is overlong, miserable and signifies nothing other than the potential of fandom to influence top-level creative decision-making,\" disliking the simplistic nature of the film's plot, calling it a \"standard goodies-versus-baddies story\", and felt it did not warrant its runtime. Furthermore, she criticized the film for featuring fan service, citing the epilogue scenes as examples, which she felt came at the expense of being a \"building block for whatever comes next\".",
        "In February 2022, the film was named one of the five finalists for the new Oscars Cheer Moment Twitter Sweepstakes as part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' \"Oscars Fan Favorite\". The scene \"The Flash Enters the Speed Force\" finished in first place."
