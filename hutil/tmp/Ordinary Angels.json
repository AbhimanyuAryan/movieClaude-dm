Meg Tilly and Kelly Fremon Craig contributed an earlier draft and received writing credit.[10] [11][12] Filming occurred in Winnipeg in April 2022[13] and Albany, New York, in June 2022.[citation needed]\n\nRelease[edit]\nOrdinary Angels was released theatrically by Lionsgate on February 23, 2024.[14] The film was originally scheduled to be released on October 13, 2023,[6] before the date was delayed to avoid competition with the concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.[15] It is scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by Columbia Pictures on April 26, 2024.[1]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, Ordinary Angels was released alongside Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 To the Hashira Training and Drive-Away Dolls, and was projected to gross $5\u20137 million from 2,800 theaters in its opening weekend.[16] It ended up debuting to $6.5 million, finishing third at the box office.[2][17] The film made $3.9 million in its second weekend (a drop of just 38%), finishing third.[18]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 84% of 90 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With a dash of grace and circumstance, this sweet display of humanity is stabilized by Hilary Swank in a role that plays to the heartstrings of all Ordinary Angels.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[20] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.[2]\nCourtney Howard of Variety wrote, \"In Swank's capable hands, the character's predictable arc is made formidable, conjuring sympathy and strength in spades. Plus, she brings a naturalism to the scenes shared with Mitchell and Hughes, rising stars in their own right, who efficiently deliver precociousness with the right amount of potency\".[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Ordinary Angels (12A)\".
