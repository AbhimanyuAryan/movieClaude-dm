        "Following the opening weekend box-office success of Bad Boys for Life, Sony announced plans for a fourth installment, with Chris Bremner returning to write the script.",
        "In April 2022, it was reported that development for the fourth film was being put on hold in light of the incident with Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards ceremony. However, the following month Sony head chairman Tom Rothman confirmed the fourth film was still in development, despite the previous report. In February 2023, Smith announced that he and Lawrence would reprise their roles for the film, which was in pre-production, with Adil & Bilall returning to direct. That same month, it was reported by musician/disc jockey Questlove that Smith had to drop out of a planned surprise appearance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards because pre-production for the fourth Bad Boys film had started earlier that week. In March 2023, it was revealed that Vanessa Hudgens would reprise her role as Kelly from Bad Boys for Life. In April 2023, it was announced that Eric Dane had been cast, reportedly as the villain, and that Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Alexander Ludwig would also reprise their roles from Bad Boys for Life. The same month, Ioan Gruffudd joined the cast. In May 2023, it was announced that Rhea Seehorn had joined the cast. The film was originally under the working title as Bad Boys: Ride or Die by co-director Adil El Arbi.",
        "Principal photography began on April 3, 2023, in Atlanta, Georgia and Miami, Florida. On May 22, 2023, TMZ released behind the scenes clips of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence filming scenes of the movie in Atlanta. Filming was suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. In March 2024, it was revealed that Jacob Scipio would reprise his role as Armando Aretas from the previous film. Filming wrapped on March 4."
