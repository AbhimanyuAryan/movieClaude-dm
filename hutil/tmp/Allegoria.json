It is the directorial debut of Spider One.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nDelving into the uncharted depths of artistic creation, \"Allegoria\" explores the restless torment of human creativity and the dark corridors of an artist's soul: a haunting place populated by the fiery demons of inspiration. With this in mind, young drama student Brody takes the stage to communicate her deeper emotions, taking the term \"visual rhetoric\" too far. Next up, tortured painter Marcus receives unexpected support from an otherworldly benefactor willing to help him meet a deadline. Following, self-applauding screenwriter Eddie has finished writing a bloody scene for his slasher movie. But as one thing leads to another, he witnesses first-hand what true evil looks like. Then, shy John can't believe his eyes when his beautiful sculptor date Ivy comes over for a drink. However, looks can be deceiving, and John is about to discover that art imitates life. Lastly, Brody's rock singer roommate Hope dabbles in the supernatural, playing with fire and forces far beyond her understanding.\n\nCast[edit]\nKyrsy Fox as Brody\nJohn Ennis as Robert Anderson Wright\nBryce Johnson as Marcus\nEdward Hong as Eddie Park\nAdam Busch as John\nAdam Marcinowski as The Whistler\nScout Taylor-Compton\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at Panic Fest in May 2022.[2] The film became available to watch on Shudder and received a Video on demand release by RLJE Films.[3][4]\n\nReception[edit]\nDrew Tinnin of Dread Central rated the film 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it \"a creepy collection of cautionary tales with a heavy metal edge that\u2019s sure to get under your skin.\"[5]\nMatt Donato of Paste rated the film 5 out of 10, calling it a \"damning, dialogue-heavy, seedy but ultimately unfocused anthology that will speak loudest to creatively suffering audiences.\"[6] The film received a rating of 2.5 out of 5 in Horror Society.[7] Ian Sedensky of Culture Crypt gave the film a score of 30, writing, \"the only entertaining moment in \u201cAllegoria\u201d comes from imagining Uncork\u2019d and Wild Eye reps seeing the Shudder and RLJE Films company cards and asking, \u201cWait, this wasn\u2019t released by one of us?\u201d\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Miska, Brad (23 June 2022). \"'Allegoria' \u2013 Spider One's Debut Horror Movie Gets a Trailer, Stills and Art [Exclusive]\".
