        "Following the release of Smile (2022), during interviews between November and December 2022, writer and director Parker Finn stated that he had intentionally left portions of the first film ambiguous, with various plotlines unresolved, while expressing interest in exploring those details in a potential sequel. He stated that while additional installments may explore the backstory of the entity, he would like to keep its mysterious nature intact. He noted that a follow-up film would be notably different from the first, stating that he believed \"there is still a lot of interesting stuff to explore in the world of Smile. ...\u00a0I'd want to make sure that there's a new, exciting, fresh way into it that the audience isn't anticipating. I also want to find some new ways to scare them and unnerve them.\"",
        "In March 2023, Finn signed a first-look deal with Paramount Pictures to develop additional horror projects. The following month at 2023 CinemaCon, Paramount announced that a sequel to Smile was green-lit and entered pre-production, with Finn returning as writer and director. In December 2023, Naomi Scott was cast in a leading role. In early 2024, Lukas Gage, Rosemarie DeWitt, Dylan Gelula, Ra\u00fal Castillo and Miles Gutierrez-Riley joined the cast. Kyle Gallner reprised his role as Joel from the first film.",
