        "After the success of Inside Out (2015), the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015, Entertainment Tonight and The Guardian considered a sequel to be \"inevitable\". Inside Out director Pete Docter was germinating ideas for a sequel while the original film's nominations were unveiled at the 88th Academy Awards in January 2016. Pixar officially confirmed the sequel's development during the D23 Expo announcement in September 2022, with Amy Poehler coming on stage to discuss the film alongside Docter. Kelsey Mann was announced as the director of the sequel (making it his feature directorial debut as he previously directed the short film Party Central in 2013), with Mark Nielsen producing, while Meg LeFauve was announced to write the film's screenplay, returning from its predecessor.",
        "To utilize \"truthful\" worldbuilding, Mann used Docter's \"five to 27 emotions\" idea from the first film that he pitched during its production. Mann's first pass included nine new emotions to make Joy feel overwhelmed with all the new emotions showing up, but felt that the story couldn't keep track with so many emotions taking the spotlight or not adding to the story, so after the first screening he decided to simplify the number. Among those emotions was Schadenfreude (having joy at someone's expense), Jealous and Guilt, but the latter two influenced the film despite being removed, with Mann feeling that Envy could relate to Jealously and how remnants of Guilt could be found within Anxiety's introduction, even giving Anxiety some of Guilt's baggage, which was inspired by that of Disneyland hotels.",
        "Poehler accepted an offer of $5\u00a0million with lucrative bonuses to reprise her role as Joy. Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black also reprise their roles as Sadness and Anger, respectively. Following a dispute over pay, both Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader declined to reprise their respective roles as Disgust and Fear; they and the rest of the returning cast were reportedly offered $100,000 each, equivalent to two percent of Poehler's salary. On November 9, 2023, with the release of the teaser trailer, it was revealed that Tony Hale and Liza Lapira would replace Hader and Kaling as Fear and Disgust, respectively, while Maya Hawke joined the cast as Anxiety, a new emotion. Mann auditioned Hawke via Zoom at the office of a back room in Epcot during a family vacation with his kids after Nielsen told him that Hawke was available to audition just then, with her anxious performance driving him to tears. On January 16, 2024, it was revealed that June Squibb had joined the cast in an undisclosed role, later revealed to be Nostalgia.",
        "On March 7, 2024, Disney revealed that Ayo Edebiri, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser, Kensington Tallman, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan joined the cast, with Edebiri, Exarchopoulos, and Hauser playing the other new emotions, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment, respectively. In addition, Tallman plays Riley, while Lane reprises her role as Mrs. Anderson, and MacLachlan reprises his role as Mr. Anderson. Also joining the cast in supporting roles are Lilimar, who plays a hockey player named Valentina, and Yvette Nicole Brown, who plays the leader of the hockey team, while Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu play Riley's friends.",
        "On March 7, 2024, with the release of the second trailer and poster, it was revealed that Andrea Datzman had composed the film's score, taking over for Michael Giacchino."
