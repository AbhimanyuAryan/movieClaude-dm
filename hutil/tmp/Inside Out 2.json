The sequel to Inside Out (2015), it is being directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Mark Nielsen, from a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve. The film stars Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan reprising their roles from the first film with Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, Maya Hawke, Ayo Edebiri, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser, and Kensington Tallman joining the cast.\nInside Out 2 was first announced in September 2022 during the D23 Expo announcement, with Mann, Nielsen, and LeFauve attached as director, producer, and writer, respectively, while Poehler was revealed to reprise her role in the film. Hale, Lapira, and Hawke joined the cast in November 2023. The film features Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter's \"five to 27 emotions\" idea from the first film that Mann pitched during its production to utilize \"truthful\" worldbuilding.\nInside Out 2 is scheduled to be released in theaters in the United States on June 14, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nInside Out 2 returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who've long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren't sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she's not alone.\u2014\u200aPixar Animation Studios[1]\nVoice cast[edit]\nAmy Poehler as Joy, a yellow happy emotion.[2]\nPhyllis Smith as Sadness, a blue sad emotion.[2]\nLewis Black as Anger, a red angry emotion.[2]\nTony Hale as Fear, a purple scared emotion. Hale replaces Bill Hader from the first film.[2]\nLiza Lapira as Disgust, a  green disgusted emotion. Lapira replaces Mindy Kaling from the first film.[2]\nMaya Hawke as Anxiety, a new orange anxious emotion.[2]\nAyo Edebiri as Envy, a new cyan jealous emotion.[3]\nAd\u00e8le Exarchopoulos as Ennui, a new indigo bored emotion.[3]\nPaul Walter Hauser as Embarrassment, a new pink embarrassed emotion.[3]\nKensington Tallman as Riley Andersen, a 13-year-old girl. Tallman replaces Kaitlyn Dias from the first film.[3]\nDiane Lane as Mrs. Andersen, Riley's mother.[2]\nKyle MacLachlan as Mr. Andersen, Riley's father.[2]\nLilimar as Valentina \"Val\" Ortiz, a popular hockey player at Riley's high school.[3]\nPaula Pell as Mom's Anger.[3][4]\nSumayyah Nuriddin-Green as Bree, Riley's friend[5]\nGrace Lu as Grace, Riley's friend[5]\nYvette Nicole Brown as Coach Roberts, the head of the summer hockey camp.[3]\nJohn Ratzenberger[3] as Fritz. This is Ratzenberger's first role in a Pixar film since Onward (2020).\nJune Squibb as Nostalgia, a new brown nostalgic emotion.[6]\nRon Funches as Bloofy, a character from Riley's favorite childhood TV show.[7]\nYong Yea as Lance Slashblade, a heroic video game character whom Riley had a crush on when she was younger.[7]\nIn addition, Sarayu Blue, Flea, Dave Goelz, James Austin Johnson, Bobby Moynihan, Frank Oz, Paula Poundstone, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Kirk Thatcher have been cast in undisclosed roles.[8][3]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nAfter the success of Inside Out (2015), the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015, Entertainment Tonight and The Guardian considered a sequel to be \"inevitable\".[9][10][11] Inside Out director Pete Docter was germinating ideas for a sequel while the original film's nominations were unveiled at the 88th Academy Awards in January 2016.[12] Pixar officially confirmed the sequel's development during the D23 Expo announcement in September 2022, with Amy Poehler coming on stage to discuss the film alongside Docter.[13] Kelsey Mann was announced as the director of the sequel (making it his feature directorial debut as he previously directed the short film Party Central in 2013), with Mark Nielsen producing, while Meg LeFauve was announced to write the film's screenplay, returning from its predecessor.[14]\nTo utilize \"truthful\" worldbuilding, Mann used Docter's \"five to 27 emotions\" idea from the first film that he pitched during its production.[15] Mann's first pass included nine new emotions to make Joy feel overwhelmed with all the new emotions showing up, but felt that the story couldn't keep track with so many emotions taking the spotlight or not adding to the story, so after the first screening he decided to simplify the number. Among those emotions was Schadenfreude (having joy at someone's expense), Jealousy and Guilt, but the latter two influenced the film despite being removed, with Mann feeling that Envy could relate to Jealousy and how remnants of Guilt could be found within Anxiety's introduction, even giving Anxiety some of Guilt's baggage, which was inspired by that of Disneyland hotels.[16]\n\nCasting[edit]\nPoehler accepted an offer of $5\u00a0million with lucrative bonuses to reprise her role as Joy. Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black also reprise their roles as Sadness and Anger, respectively.[3] Following a dispute over pay, both Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader declined to reprise their respective roles as Disgust and Fear; they and the rest of the returning cast were reportedly offered $100,000 each, equivalent to two percent of Poehler's salary.[17] On November 9, 2023, with the release of the teaser trailer, it was revealed that Tony Hale and Liza Lapira would replace Hader and Kaling as Fear and Disgust, respectively, while Maya Hawke joined the cast as Anxiety, a new emotion.[2] Mann auditioned Hawke via Zoom at the office of a back room in Epcot during a family vacation with his kids after Nielsen told him that Hawke was available to audition just then, with her anxious performance driving him to tears.[18] On January 16, 2024, it was revealed that June Squibb had joined the cast in an undisclosed role,[8] later revealed to be Nostalgia.[6]\nOn March 7, 2024, Disney revealed that Ayo Edebiri, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser, Kensington Tallman, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan joined the cast, with Edebiri, Exarchopoulos, and Hauser playing the other new emotions, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment, respectively.[3] In addition, Tallman plays Riley, while Lane reprises her role as Mrs. Anderson, and MacLachlan reprises his role as Mr. Anderson.[3] Also joining the cast in supporting roles are Lilimar, who plays a hockey player named Valentina, and Yvette Nicole Brown, who plays the leader of the hockey team, while Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu play Bree and Grace, Riley's friends.[3][5]\n\nMusic[edit]\nOn March 7, 2024, with the release of the second trailer and poster, it was revealed that Andrea Datzman had composed the film's score, taking over for Michael Giacchino.[19]\n\nRelease[edit]\nInside Out 2 is scheduled to be released in theaters in the United States on June 14, 2024.[13]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe teaser trailer for the film, along with the poster, was released on November 9, 2023. James Withbrook of Gizmodo and Inverse's Rotem Rusak highlighted the introduction of three other emotions in the poster: Embarrassment, Ennui, and Envy.[20][21] The teaser was viewed over 157 million times in the first 24 hours across all social media platforms\u2014including over 78 million from TikTok\u2014becoming the most-watched animated film trailer launch in the Walt Disney Company's history, surpassing the previous record holder, Frozen II (2019).[22] A clip from the film was also aired during the Super Bowl LVIII, named \"Team\".[23] The second trailer, along with a new poster, was released on March 7, 2024.[19] This trailer also marked the debut of the \"standard\" variant of the 2023 Walt Disney Pictures logo, which was introduced the year before for the studio's centennial anniversary.[24] The first 35 minutes of the film were screened during The Walt Disney Studios' presentation of first looks at their 2024 theatrical release slate at CinemaCon on April 11, 2024.[25]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Upcoming\".
