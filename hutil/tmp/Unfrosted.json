Seinfeld and Feresten also serve as producers of the film alongside Beau Beauman, through their production company Columbus 81 Productions. The film stars an ensemble cast that includes Seinfeld, Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, James Marsden, Jack McBrayer, Thomas Lennon, Bobby Moynihan, Maria Bakalova, Max Greenfield, Bill Burr, Dan Levy, Christian Slater, and Hugh Grant. Christophe Beck will compose the film's score. This film is loosely based on the true story of the creation of Pop-Tarts toaster pastries.\nThe film is set to be released in the United States on May 3, 2024, via Netflix.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nKellogg's and Post Cereal compete to see if they can produce a revolutionary breakfast pastry in 1963 Michigan.\n\nCast[edit]\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

Jerry Seinfeld would direct, produce, co-write and star in the film, which is based on a joke he told about the creation of the Pop-Tart.[4] In June 2022, Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, and James Marsden were among the newest additions to the cast.[5] Grant provided an audition tape for Seinfeld, being the first time he had done so in over 30 years.[6] In August, Maria Bakalova was announced for a cameo appearance.[7] In February 2024, it was revealed that Bill Burr and Dan Levy joined the cast.[8]\nThe production was granted a tax credit to film in California in February 2022.[9] Filming began on May 25, 2022, in Los Angeles, and was set to run until July 1.[10] Filming also took place at the University of California, Irvine.[11][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn November 2022, Seinfeld told the press that Netflix executives were watching the final cut of the movie for the first time, with a projected release in early 2023.[12] This did not materialize. Jim Gaffigan appeared at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2024 as part of promotion for the film.[citation needed]\n\nMusic[edit]\nChristophe Beck will be providing the score for the film.[13] Meghan Trainor and Jimmy Fallon provide a song for the film called \"Sweet Morning Heat.\"[14]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film will be released on Netflix on May 3, 2024.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r Richard, Nate. \"'Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story': Release Date, Cast, Plot, and Everything We Know About the Jerry Seinfeld Movie\".
