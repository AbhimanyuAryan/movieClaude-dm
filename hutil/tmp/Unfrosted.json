        "It was announced in June 2021 that Netflix had won the rights to the project. Jerry Seinfeld would direct, produce, co-write and star in the film, which is based on a joke he told about the creation of the Pop-Tart. In June 2022, Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, and James Marsden were among the newest additions to the cast. Grant provided an audition tape for Seinfeld, being the first time he had done so in over 30 years. In August, Maria Bakalova was announced for a cameo appearance. In February 2024, it was revealed that Bill Burr and Dan Levy joined the cast.",
