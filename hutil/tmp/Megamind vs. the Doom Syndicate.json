        "Two days after the events of the first film, Megamind now assumes the role of Metro City's defender. He, along with Ol' Chum (formerly Minion), stops a criminal trio known as the Go-Fish gang from stealing a priceless fish. For his heroic efforts, Megamind is presented the key to the city. Chum, feeling left out and undervalued in his efforts, tells Megamind that he wants to be his sidekick. Upon being rejected, Chum claims that he will search for other opportunities, which Megamind allows.",
        "The Doom Syndicate, a supervillain team that Megamind used to be part of, breaks out of prison to visit him, thinking that he remains a villain and that his hero role is part of an evil plan. They embark on a crime spree, eventually challenging Megamind to prove he is still evil by robbing a bank. Megamind struggles to do so, but is helped by Keiko Morita, his self-proclaimed biggest fan, who helps him stage a fake robbery. Meanwhile, Chum has taken up work at a run-down diner.",
        "Keeping his old crew fooled, Megamind reveals an abandoned villainous plot of launching Metro City to the Moon using rockets planted underground. The Doom Syndicate prepares to launch them, but Megamind stalls them. They realize he is up to something, and vow to either launch Metro City themselves or destroy it. Realizing that he cannot defeat the Syndicate alone, Megamind tracks Chum inside his remodeled diner and attempts to enlist his help. However, after realizing he might belong more at the shop than with him, Megamind regrets letting Chum go.",
        "Megamind finds himself overpowered by the Doom Syndicate after they learn of his facade. He hides in an alleyway, feeling defeated, but is confronted by Roxanne and Keiko who remind him it is okay to ask for help from others. Chum also returns as Megamind tells him he is truly his sidekick. Megamind, Chum, Roxanne, and Keiko team up to face the Doom Syndicate, but fail to stop the launch. They manage to redirect Metro City safely back to Earth. Roxanne is elected the new Mayor of Metro City, while Keiko launches a newly designed hero signal as Megamind feels accomplished in his new team.",
        "In a mid-credits scene, the Doom Syndicate are locked back up in prison, when they are visited by Megamind's former mentor, Machiavillain."

        "In April 2011, DreamWorks Animation's then-CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie-genre parodies like Megamind (2010), Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009) and Shark Tale (2004) or sequels to these, saying that these films \"all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now\".",
        "In February 2022, it was announced that Peacock had ordered DreamWorks Animation Television to produce a spin-off series titled Megamind\u2019s Guide to Defending Your City. In August of that year, it was confirmed that the writing had concluded and that the show had entered production.",

Ferguson replaced Will Ferrell as the voice of Megamind, Post replaced Tina Fey as the voice of Roxanne and Brener replaced David Cross as the voice of Minion. Alongside the film, Peacock also revealed that the previously announced television series, retitled from Megamind's Guide to Defending Your City to Megamind Rules!, would serve as a follow-up to the film and be released the same day.",
        "The concept of the Doom Syndicate was originally from an early version of the first film, but they were scrapped from the movie and instead were reused for the 2010 tie-in video game Megamind: Ultimate Showdown. Although the group made their return in Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate, the group members differ from the ones in the video game, as Behemoth and Lady Doppler are the only two characters who were originally from the early version of the first film seen in the book The Art of Megamind.",
        "The animation was provided by 88 Pictures, with production services by Doberman Pictures."

        "In a two out of four-star rating for RogerEbert.com, Nell Minow states the film \"is intermittently funny and briefly heartwarming, as though they ran the original through the washing machine a few times, and then faxed it. [...] Compared to the original or to more recent films like Boss Baby and The Bad Guys, it is slapdash and lightweight.\" Ryan Leston of IGN called the film \"a lazy, 14-years-too-late cash-in on Dreamworks IP\", giving a four out of ten rating.",
        "Director Eric Fogel has stated that he is proud of the film, which had a \"minuscule\" budget compared to the original film."
