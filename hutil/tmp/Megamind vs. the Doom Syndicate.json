Billed as both a standalone sequel to Megamind and the pilot for the television series Megamind Rules!, the film stars Keith Ferguson as Megamind, who clashes with his former supervillain team who schemes to launch Metro City to the moon. Laura Post and Josh Brener also star as Roxanne Ritchie and Ol' Chum (formerly Minion) respectively, with Maya Aoki Tuttle, Emily Tunon, Talon Warburton, Scott Adsit, Chris Sullivan, Tony Hale, Jeanine Mason and Adam Lambert joining. \nUnlike its predecessor, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate was produced by DreamWorks Animation Television. It was released on Peacock on March 1, 2024. Unlike the first film, Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate was poorly reviewed by critics and audiences, with many deeming it a \"downgrade\" in every aspect of its predecessor.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTwo days after the events of the first film, Megamind now assumes the role of Metro City's defender. He, along with Ol' Chum (formerly Minion), stops a criminal trio known as the Go-Fish gang from stealing a priceless fish. For his heroic efforts, Megamind is presented the key to the city. Chum, feeling left out and undervalued in his efforts, tells Megamind that he wants to be his sidekick. Upon being rejected, Chum claims that he will search for other opportunities, which Megamind allows.\nThe Doom Syndicate, a supervillain team that Megamind used to be part of, breaks out of prison to visit him, thinking that he remains a villain and that his hero role is part of an evil plan. They embark on a crime spree, eventually challenging Megamind to prove he is still evil by robbing a bank. Megamind struggles to do so, but is helped by Keiko Morita, his self-proclaimed biggest fan, who helps him stage a fake robbery. Meanwhile, Chum has taken up work at a run-down diner.\nKeeping his old crew fooled, Megamind reveals an abandoned villainous plot of launching Metro City to the Moon using rockets planted underground. The Doom Syndicate prepares to launch them, but Megamind stalls them. They realize he is up to something, and vow to either launch Metro City themselves or destroy it. Realizing that he cannot defeat the Syndicate alone, Megamind tracks Chum inside his remodeled diner and attempts to enlist his help. However, after realizing he might belong more at the shop than with him, Megamind regrets letting Chum go.\nMegamind finds himself overpowered by the Doom Syndicate after they learn of his facade. He hides in an alleyway, feeling defeated, but is confronted by Roxanne and Keiko who remind him it is okay to ask for help from others. Chum also returns as Megamind tells him he is truly his sidekick. Megamind, Chum, Roxanne, and Keiko team up to face the Doom Syndicate, but fail to stop the launch. They manage to redirect Metro City safely back to Earth. Roxanne is elected the new Mayor of Metro City, while Keiko launches a newly designed hero signal as Megamind feels accomplished in his new team.\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Doom Syndicate are locked back up in prison, when they are visited by Megamind's former mentor, Machiavillain.\n\nCast[edit]\nKeith Ferguson as Megamind, a blue-skinned, humanoid alien supervillain-turned-superhero with a large cranium. Ferguson replaces Will Ferrell from the original film, in addition to previously voicing the character in the first film's tie-in video games.\nLaura Post as Roxanne Ritchi, a strong-willed news reporter who is Megamind's friend and love interest. Post replaces Tina Fey from the original film.\nJosh Brener as Ol' Chum (formerly Minion), a talking alien fish who has been Megamind's sidekick and best friend since childhood. In the sequel, it is revealed that he changed his name after a cease-and-desist from fast food chain Mr. Minion's Meatsicles. Brener replaces David Cross from the original film.[1]\nMaya Aoki Tuttle as Keiko Morita, Megamind's child fan and social media influencer.\nEmily Tunon as Lady Doppler, a storm-themed supervillain who can manipulate and control the weather.\nScott Adsit as Pierre Pressure, a mime-themed supervillain who has the power of hypnosis.\nTalon Warburton as Lord Nighty-Knight, a knight-themed supervillain who can harness shadows and turn them into weapons.\nChris Sullivan as Behemoth, a giant lava golem.\nAdam Lambert as Machiavillain, a supervillain who was Megamind's former mentor.\nRoger Craig Smith as Mayor Jody Smelt, the cowardly mayor of Metro City.\nJeanine Mason as Christina Christo, the Mayor's assistant.\nTodd Haberkorn as Big King Fish, the short leader of the Go Fish Gang.\nEric Murphy as Blue Mackerel, the skinny member of the Go Fish Gang.\nJoey Rudman as Red Snapper, the rounded member of the Go Fish Gang.\nTony Hale as Mel/Mr. Donut, the owner of the rundown diner turned donut shop.\nMichael Beattie as Eccentric Eddie, a homeless man who has a pet cockroach name Thaddeus.\nEric Fogel as Polly 227, a robot parakeet Megamind built for Ol' Chum.\nIn addition, the characters Metro Man and Hal Stewart / Titan / Tighten appear in a flashback scene, albeit with non-speaking roles.\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn April 2011, DreamWorks Animation's then-CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie-genre parodies like Megamind (2010), Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009) and Shark Tale (2004) or sequels to these, saying that these films \"all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now\".[2]\nIn February 2022, it was announced that Peacock had ordered DreamWorks Animation Television to produce a spin-off series titled Megamind\u2019s Guide to Defending Your City.[3] In August of that year, it was confirmed that the writing had concluded and that the show had entered production.[4]\nIn February 2024, DreamWorks Animation Television revealed a trailer for Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate, with Keith Ferguson, Laura Post, Josh Brener, Maya Aoki Tuttle, Emily Tunon, Talon Warburton, Scott Adsit, Chris Sullivan, Tony Hale, Jeanine Mason and Adam Lambert as part of the main cast. Ferguson replaced Will Ferrell as the voice of Megamind, Post replaced Tina Fey as the voice of Roxanne and Brener replaced David Cross as the voice of Minion. Alongside the film, Peacock also revealed that the previously announced television series, retitled from Megamind's Guide to Defending Your City to Megamind Rules!, would serve as a follow-up to the film and be released the same day.[5]\nThe concept of the Doom Syndicate was originally from an early version of the first film,[6] but they were scrapped from the movie and instead were reused for the 2010 tie-in video game Megamind: Ultimate Showdown. Although the group made their return in Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate, the group members differ from the ones in the video game, as Behemoth and Lady Doppler are the only two characters who were originally from the early version of the first film seen in the book The Art of Megamind.[6]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nThe animation was provided by 88 Pictures, with production services by Doberman Pictures.[citation needed]\n\nRelease[edit]\nMegamind vs. the Doom Syndicate began streaming on Peacock on March 1, 2024, alongside the first 8 episodes of Megamind Rules! [7]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 11 reviews, with an average score of 2.8/10.[8]\nIn a two out of four-star rating for RogerEbert.com, Nell Minow states the film \"is intermittently funny and briefly heartwarming, as though they ran the original through the washing machine a few times, and then faxed it. [...] Compared to the original or to more recent films like Boss Baby and The Bad Guys, it is slapdash and lightweight.\"[9] Ryan Leston of IGN called the film \"a lazy, 14-years-too-late cash-in on Dreamworks IP\", giving a four out of ten rating.[10]\nDirector Eric Fogel has stated that he is proud of the film, which had a \"minuscule\" budget compared to the original film.[a][11]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ This budget was also split for the television series Megamind Rules!
