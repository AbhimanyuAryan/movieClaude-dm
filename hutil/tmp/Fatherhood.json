        "Childhood sweethearts Matt and Liz Logelin prepare for the birth of their first child. Soon after delivering their daughter, Maddy, Liz suddenly suffers a pulmonary embolism and dies.",
        "Matt is devastated, but is determined to raise Maddy as a single parent. His friends and family, however, are concerned that he may not have the skills or patience to handle raising Maddy alone. Liz's mother, Marion, who has a tense relationship with Matt, is who feels this the most strongly. After he refuses to let her stay for six months to help care for Maddy or move back to his hometown of Minnesota, Marion warns him that Maddy needs family and female role models, and that he has to think about what is best for her.",
        "Though Matt initially struggles with the demands of Maddy's care while working full-time, grieving Liz, and suffering from gendered expectations and insensitivity from others who do not respect his role in his daughter's life, he eventually succeeds with the help of friends and fellow parents.",
        "Maddy grows into a confident and tomboyish young girl, while Matt is set up at a party with a mutual friend. Though he is unnerved that her name is Lizzie, they hit it off and begin dating. Though Maddy initially does not like the idea of her father dating, she quickly warms up to Lizzie, and they become friends. But when Maddy is injured on the playground and Matt does not hear the school's phone calls while sleeping with Lizzie, he fears that dating her is getting in the way of focusing on Maddy's needs. He breaks up with her, which upsets Maddy.",
        "Matt and Maddy travel back to Minnesota for Marion's birthday. Maddy, beginning to feel the absence of a mother figure in her life more acutely, is overjoyed to be able to stay in her mother's old room and learn more about Liz. Matt, however, is unhappy seeing Liz's room changed, and insists that it is confusing for Maddy. When he tries to leave with her, she insists that she is happier here with family and reminders of her mother. Believing that he has repeatedly failed to understand Maddy's real needs, Matt reluctantly leaves her with her grandparents and returns home alone.",
        "Despite success at work and an anticipated promotion, Matt misses Maddy and blames himself for being a bad father. When in the airport, preparing for a long business trip abroad, Matt is overwhelmed with sights of fatherhood and leaves to go back to Minnesota, where he reunites with Maddy and makes up with her. With Marion's blessing, they return home, where Matt rekindles his relationship with Lizzie."

The site's critics consensus reads, \"Fatherhood offers few surprises, but strong work from a smartly assembled cast gives this fact-based story real emotional resonance.\" According to Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 53 out of 100 based on 18 critics, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "William Bibbiani of the TheWrap praised Hart's \"confidently laid-back and affable lead performance,\" and wrote, \"Perhaps a little too slight to be memorable in the long run, this sensitive and charming tale reassures without, somehow, completely ignoring reality.\" From The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarkye called the film \"both an effective star vehicle and a tender tearjerker,\" and said, \"Hart, usually known for his comedy... embraces a more dramatic side here, and is surprisingly convincing in these moments.\""
