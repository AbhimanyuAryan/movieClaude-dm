The film stars Victoria Moroles and Kuhoo Verma. It is titled after the brand of emergency contraceptive, which plays a significant role in the film's plot.\nIt was released on May 28, 2021, by Hulu.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn South Dakota, Sunny, a sheltered Indian teenager, is pressured into throwing a party by her rebellious, outgoing friend Lupe. Though she fears disobeying her mother \u2014 who is out of town on a business trip \u2014 she agrees in the hopes of impressing and seducing Hunter, her crush. After seeing Hunter leave the party with the more popular Emma, however, she winds up having sex with her friend Kyle, a somewhat eccentric devout Christian \u2014 both almost immediately realize the encounter was a mistake.\nThe next morning, Sunny informs Lupe that she has lost her virginity, but does not say whom to, leading Lupe to believe that she had sex with Hunter. In the bathroom, she is horrified to discover that she never removed the condom Kyle used during intercourse, fearing that she could become pregnant. Informing Lupe, the two set out to the local pharmacy to get a Plan B pill, but are denied. Following Lupe's suggestion, they decide their best option is to drive to the nearest Planned Parenthood \u2014 located in Rapid City \u2014 using Sunny's mom's car.\nSunny and Lupe get lost on the road and are redirected by a helpful convenience store clerk, whom they inform of Sunny's situation. She suggests they visit her cousin, a drug dealer based in a nearby playground. The girls confront the dealer, who offers them fake IDs in exchange for oral sex, and manage to escape with the IDs and an unmarked \"birth control pill\" after Sunny accidentally damages his penis. After Sunny falls asleep, Lupe drives to a bowling alley where she hopes to meet Logan \u2014 a person whom she met online and has been communicating with frequently. Sunny, while initially reluctant, quickly accepts due to the prospect of meeting Logan and pleasantly surprised to find that Hunter and his friends are at the alley as well. The girls split up \u2014 Lupe goes off to meet Logan, and Hunter invites Sunny to a nearby diner. Logan, revealed to be a female drummer, has sex with Lupe in Sunny's car.  Meanwhile, after learning that Hunter only left her party to get Emma home safely rather than to have sex with her, Sunny confides in Hunter about her situation. Hunter holds no judgement towards Sunny, sympathizing with her and reassuring her that everything will work out. After Hunter drives her back to the bowling alley, the two kiss.\nThe girls reunite, but quickly discover Sunny's car (which Lupe left with Logan) to be missing. Despairing, Sunny takes the unmarked \"birth control\" pill they stole from the drug dealer \u2014 later revealed to be Amphetamine \u2014  and argues with Lupe, blaming her for their situation. Lupe realizes they can locate the car with a \"Find My\" app, which turns out to be parked at a nearby house party. Lupe finds and confronts Logan, who insists that the car wasn't taken by her, but by her band's lead singer, Xander. Lupe and Sunny find Xander to be extremely intoxicated. He attempts to attack the girls \u2014 they escape, but Sunny nearly runs Xander over. Xander is fine, but disoriented; Logan stays behind to take care of him, sharing a kiss with Lupe before the two part ways.\nBack in the car, a now sober Sunny confronts Lupe on why she never told her about her true sexuality. Lupe admits she was afraid it would affect their friendship, which Sunny instantly dismisses as nonsense. Shortly after, Lupe discovers the true nature of Sunny's sexual encounter through a phone call from Kyle. Sunny says she lied because of how much more sexually experienced Lupe seems, which Lupe says is just an act. They agree to stop lying to each other.\nFinally, Sunny and Lupe make it to Rapid City's Planned Parenthood, but are devastated to find it permanently shut down. Sunny breaks down emotionally and admits she needs her mother's help. The two drive home.\nWhen they get back, both face altercations with their parents.  Lupe is surprised by her father's concern for her. After asking him if he would ever \"kick her out,\" he reaffirms his unconditional love for her and the two embrace. Sunny's mom is initially angry, but her mood softens after a frustrated Sunny rants about feeling the need to be perfect all the time for her. Like Lupe and her dad, the two reconnect, and Sunny admits that she needs the morning after pill, which her mom quickly buys for her.\n\nCast[edit]\nVictoria Moroles discusses Plan B in 2021\nKuhoo Verma discusses Plan B in 2021\n\nVictoria Moroles as Lupe\nKuhoo Verma as Sunny\nMichael Provost as Hunter\nMason Cook as Kyle\nJolly Abraham as Rosie\nJacob Vargas as Pastor Pedro\nMyha'la Herrold as Logan\nTimothy Granaderos as Xander\nRachel Dratch as Ms. Flaucher\nEdi Patterson as Doris\nMoses Storm as Andy\nJay Chandrasekhar as Pharmacist\nJosh Ruben as Philip\nJoseph Calveric as Lupe's brother\nProduction[edit]\nIn September 2020, it was announced Natalie Morales would direct the film, from a screenplay by Prathi Srinivasan and Joshua Levy, with LD Entertainment and American High set to produce, and Hulu to distribute.[1] In October 2020, Victoria Moroles and Kuhoo Verma joined the cast of the film.[2]\nPrincipal photography began on September 30, 2020, and concluded on November 10, 2020, in Syracuse, New York.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt was released on May 28, 2021, by Hulu.[4] Internationally, the film was released via Star content hub on Disney+, on Star+ in Lat\u00edn America, and on Disney+ Hotstar in India and Southeast Asia.[5][6]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nPlan B holds a 96% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 53 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.3/10.
