As of June 30, 2020, more than 260,000 people had signed a petition in order to block the film. Detractors labelled the film as \"Christianophobic garbage\" as well as claiming that it aims to \"ridicule people of faith\". The New York Post compared the controversy to that of the 2019 Brazilian satirical film The First Temptation of Christ, which depicted Jesus as gay and resulted in a ban overturned by the Supreme Federal Court.[8] However, there is no indication of promotional materials that portray Jesus as a lesbian.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Sneider, Jeff (July 13, 2021). \"'Habit' Trailer Finds Bella Thorne Posing as a Nun With a Gun Opposite Gavin Rossdale\".
