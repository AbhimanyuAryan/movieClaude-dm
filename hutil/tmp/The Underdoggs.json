        "Jaycen \"Two-J's\" Jennings is an arrogant washed up former football superstar. After a major car accident, Jaycen is ordered to perform community service in his old neighborhood. He sees an opportunity to rebuild his brand by coaching a struggling youth football team, where one of the players is the son of his former flame Cherise. Despite being rough on the kids at first, Jaycen finds a way to connect with them and help inspire them to do better.",
        "Jaycen sees an opportunity for a comeback by having his own sports show, but the first taping is on the day of the team's big game. Despite trying to revive his career, Jaycen chooses to be with the team. They almost win until one of the players misses the line to make the touchdown, causing the other team to win, but everyone still remains inspired by the underdog team, and Jaycen appears to get back with Cherise."

In December 2023, it was announced that the film would skip theaters and be released straight to Amazon Prime Video on that date in response to a decline in R-rated comedy films faring well at the box office during that summer."
