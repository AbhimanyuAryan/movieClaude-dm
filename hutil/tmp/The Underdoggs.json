The film stars Snoop Dogg, Tika Sumpter, Andrew Schulz, Mike Epps, Kal Penn, Kandi Burruss and George Lopez.\nThe Underdoggs was released by Amazon MGM Studios as a Prime Video exclusive on January 26, 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nJaycen \"Two-J's\" Jennings is an arrogant washed up former football superstar. After a major car accident, Jaycen is ordered to perform community service in his old neighborhood. He sees an opportunity to rebuild his brand by coaching a struggling youth football team, where one of the players is the son of his former flame Cherise. Despite being rough on the kids at first, Jaycen finds a way to connect with them and help inspire them to do better.\nJaycen sees an opportunity for a comeback by having his own sports show, but the first taping is on the day of the team's big game. Despite trying to revive his career, Jaycen chooses to be with the team. They almost win until one of the players misses the line to make the touchdown, causing the other team to win, but everyone still remains inspired by the underdog team, and Jaycen appears to get back with Cherise.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nSnoop Dogg as Jaycen\nElias Ferguson as young Jaycen\nTika Sumpter as Cherise\nJonigan Booth as Trey\nCaleb Dixon as Dwayne\nAdan James Carrillo as Tony\nAlexander Michael Gordon as Gary\nKylah Davila as Ghost\nMike Epps as Kareem\nGeorge Lopez as Coach Feis\nShamori Washington as Bale\nSchelle Purcell as Esa\nAndrew Schulz as Chip Collins\nKal Penn as Ryan Kauffman\nKandi Burruss as Judge Tara\nProduction[edit]\nThe idea for the film was pitched by Snoop Dogg and Constance Schwartz-Morini.[3][4] On August 2, 2022, it was announced that Snoop Dogg would star in and produce the film, to be directed by Charles Stone III, with the screenplay by Danny Segal and Isaac Schamis, produced by Schwartz-Morini, Kenya Barris, Mychelle Deschamps, and Jonathan Glickman.[5][6] On October 4, 2022, it was announced that Tika Sumpter, Mike Epps, Andrew Schulz, and George Lopez had joined the cast, alongside child actors Jonigan Booth, Adam James Carrillo, Kylah Davila, Caleb Dixon, Alexander Michael Gordon, and Shamori Washington.[7]\nPrincipal photography began in Atlanta, Georgia on September 26, 2022, and filmed for seven weeks.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Underdoggs was originally set to be released in theaters on October 20, 2023,[9][10] but the release date was later changed to January 26, 2024. In December 2023, it was announced that the film would skip theaters and be released straight to Amazon Prime Video on that date in response to a decline in R-rated comedy films faring well at the box office during that summer.[11]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 50 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Snoop Dogg remains an appealing screen presence and The Underdoggs offers its share of laughs, but this crass youth sports comedy isn't doing anything audiences haven't seen done better before.\"[12] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Underdoggs (15)\".
