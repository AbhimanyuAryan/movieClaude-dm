Micah Fitzerman-Blue, Noah Harpster, Matt Spicer, Max Winkler, Dan Gregor and Doug Mand serve as co-screenwriters, with an original story written by Gabe Sachs, Jeff Judah, Spicer and Winkler. It stars Adam DeVine, Jeffrey Tambor and Gillian Jacobs. The film was released on Disney+ on August 14, 2020. The film was removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTheo Moses is an aspiring young magician coping with the death of his father. His mother reveals his acceptance video from the Institute of Magic, a summer camp run by the eccentric Roy Preston; assuming his father applied for him, Theo agrees to attend. Andy Duckerman is a down-on-his-luck former magician with a grudge against the famous Kristina Darkwood, who has a successful solo act on the Las Vegas strip. Preston persuades Andy, his former student, to return to camp as a counselor alongside Darkwood.\nAt camp, the students are split into four different cabins to face each other in the end-of-year Top Hat competition, where one student will win the coveted Golden Wand. Andy is assigned to lead the Hearts cabin, including Theo; allergy-prone Nathan Jenkins; rabbit-obsessed Ruth Brusselbach; Judd Kessler, the less talented son of a famous magician; and antisocial Vera Costa. Darkwood leads the Diamonds, including previous Golden Wand winner and bully Vic d'Antonio, and Janelle Santos, who takes a liking to Theo.\nThe inexperienced Hearts struggle to learn magic, and a frustrated Andy almost quits, but discovers that Theo has a gift for card tricks. Determined to beat Darkwood, Andy helps the Hearts realize their hidden talents: Judd embraces costume design, Ruth has an affinity for birds over bunnies, Nathan can perform impressive mental calculations, and Vera begins to make friends. Helping Theo overcome his stage fright, Andy reveals that he and Darkwood met as campers, and became a couple as well as magic partners; she accepted a television deal behind his back, and her career took off while he fell into obscurity.\nDarkwood convinces Janelle, whose wealthy parents send her to various camps instead of spending time with her, to give magic a chance. Attempting to humiliate Nathan, Vic is outdone by Theo and seemingly burns Theo's cards \u2013 a gift from his father, who introduced him to magic. Distraught, Theo bonds with Andy and his fellow Hearts, as well as Janelle. After the Diamonds check out all the camp's props for themselves, Andy takes the Hearts into town to train with whatever they can find, and the young magicians perform their acts in public.\nAndy confronts Darkwood, who already reprimanded her team, and she reveals the truth behind their falling out: she tried to negotiate a deal for both of them, which he never gave her a chance to explain. She has booked him a matinee in Vegas for the next day; with Preston's encouragement, Andy accepts, knowing he will miss the Hearts' training but be back in time for the Top Hat competition that night. Preston informs the Hearts that Andy has gone to Vegas, but after his successful matinee, Andy is invited to perform the evening show \u2013 at the same time as the competition.\nThe students' families, including Janelle's parents, arrive for the competition. Without Andy there, a nervous Theo is encouraged by Preston, who shows him the supportive video Theo's mother submitted as his application. Andy \u2013 having turned down the Vegas show \u2013 watches his team perform, and deduces that Preston arranged everything to restore Andy's love for magic. Theo conquers his fears to give the final performance, a heartfelt card trick thanking his family for their support. The Hearts win the Top Hat, and Janelle is awarded the Golden Wand.\nAndy is hired to be the camp's year-round talent director, and reconciles with Darkwood, who agrees to teach with him if he performs at her Vegas show on occasion. Vic apologizes to Theo and returns his unharmed cards; Judd's father proudly accepts that he is a talented designer, rather than a magician; Ruth finally holds a rabbit while forming a close friendship with Vera; and Janelle and Theo share a kiss. The film ends with a new Institute of Magic video headed by Andy.\n\nCast[edit]\nAdam DeVine as Andy Duckerman, a camp counselor who was a former magic prodigy and bears a grudge against Kristina\nJeffrey Tambor as Roy Preston, the mentor and owner of the magic camp\nGillian Jacobs as Kristina Darkwood, a camp counselor who's a successful magician and was Andy's former partner\nNathaniel McIntyre as Theo Moses, a 12-year-old boy who attends the magic camp as he copes with his father's death\nCole Sand as Nathan Jenkins, a boy ridden with allergies who befriends Theo\nIsabella Crovetti as Ruth Brusselbach, a girl obsessed with bunnies who becomes a bird expert\nJosie Totah[Note 1] as Judd Kessler, the son of a famed magician who prefers fashion over tricks\nIzabella Alvarez as Vera Costa, an antisocial, sarcastic girl\nHayden Crawford as Vic d'Antonio, a bully who's the previous year's Golden Wand winner\nBianca Grava as Janelle Santos, a rich girl who becomes Theo's crush\nAldis Hodge as Devin Moses, Theo's father\nRochelle Aytes as Zoe Moses, Theo's mother\nKrystal Joy Brown as Lena Lambert, one of the camp counselors\nDesmond Chiam as Xerxes, one of the camp counselors\nLonnie Chavis as Cameron Moses, Theo's younger brother\nMichael Hitchcock as Kornelius Kessler, Judd's magician father\nMichael Anastasia as Hamilton, Janelle's chauffeur\nWillie Garson as Casino Manager\nMagician Justin Willman has a cameo as one of Andy's taxi fares.
