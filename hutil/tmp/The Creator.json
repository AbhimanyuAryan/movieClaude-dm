    "Plot": [
        "In 2055, an artificial intelligence created by the U.S. government detonates a nuclear warhead over Los Angeles, California. In response, most of the Western world pledges to eradicate AI to prevent humanity's extinction. Their efforts are resisted by New Asia, a region comprising East, South and Southeast Asia, whose people continue to embrace AI. The U.S. military aims to assassinate \"Nirmata\", the chief architect behind New Asia's AI advancements, using the USS NOMAD (North American Orbital Mobile Aerospace Defense), a space station capable of launching destructive attacks from orbit.",
        "A decade after Los Angeles, U.S. Army sergeant Joshua Taylor is undercover in New Asia with his pregnant wife Maya, believed to be the daughter of Nirmata. Taylor is exposed when their home is attacked, and Maya is presumed dead after a NOMAD strike. Five years later, Taylor, now part of the ground zero cleanup crew, is recruited by General Andrews and Colonel Howell for a mission against \"Alpha O\", a new weapon developed by Nirmata that could destroy NOMAD. Shown evidence of Maya's survival, Taylor agrees. Infiltrating a compound in New Asia, Taylor finds a robotic \"simulant\" in the form of a young girl who has the ability to control technology. Dubbing her \"Alphie\", Taylor disobeys Howell and seeks out his ex-commander, Drew.",
        "Drew declares Alphie could be humanity's most powerful weapon. After an attack kills Drew's simulant girlfriend and leaves Drew fatally wounded, Taylor learns Maya is Nirmata. Taylor and Alphie are captured by New Asian forces led by Harun, a simulant soldier and former ally of Taylor's. Harun states that the detonation in Los Angeles was a human error blamed on AI, who only wish to peacefully co-exist with humanity. After escaping his captors, Taylor rescues Alphie as Howell launches an attack on the village. Taylor learns that Maya is in a coma: since simulants cannot harm Nirmata, she is \"stranded\" and unable to die; Alphie was modeled after their unborn daughter. As Taylor takes Maya off life support, U.S. forces led by Howell arrive. They are killed by Harun, who tells Taylor NOMAD must be destroyed for the war to end.",
        "Captured again, Taylor is coerced into killing Alphie with an electroshock weapon. However, Andrews later discovers this to be a ruse, allowing the pair to escape. Boarding a lunar shuttle at the Los Angeles Interplanetary Air and Space Port, Alphie forces the spacecraft to land aboard NOMAD as Andrews orders a large-scale assault on remaining AI bases. As Taylor plants explosives, Andrews activates a robot to prevent him from escaping, and Taylor is forced to eject an escape pod with Alphie in it. As Alphie arrives safely on Earth, Taylor reunites with a simulant bearing Maya's likeness, activated by Alphie with Maya's memories, and they embrace as NOMAD explodes, killing Taylor and destroying Maya."

    "Production": [
        "Development on the film began in November 2019, when Gareth Edwards signed to direct and write an untitled science fiction project for New Regency, with Edwards' Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) co-producer Kiri Hart as producer. A test shoot and location scouting was conducted that year, with Edwards using it as the opportunity to envision the film's look: \"I took a camera and a 1970s anamorphic lens, we went location-scouting in Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Nepal. Our whole plan was just to go to the greatest locations in the world, because the cost of a flight is way less than the cost of building a set. We were going to hopscotch around the world and shoot this film, then layer in the science-fiction on top afterwards. If our film is trying to achieve something visually, it's trying to feel real in terms of science-fiction.\"",
        "In February 2020, Edwards was officially announced as director. He cited films such as Apocalypse Now (1979), Baraka (1992), Blade Runner (1982), Akira (1988), Rain Man (1988), The Hit (1984), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Paper Moon (1973) as sources of inspiration.",
        "In May 2021, John David Washington was announced to star, and the film's working title was revealed to be True Love. In June 2021, Gemma Chan, Danny McBride, and Benedict Wong entered negotiations to star. The involvements of Chan and Wong were confirmed in January 2022, with Allison Janney, Sturgill Simpson, and Marc Menchaca joining the cast. Simpson was reported to be taking over for McBride who departed due to scheduling conflicts. In February 2022, Ken Watanabe joined the cast to replace Wong, who also had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts; Watanabe had previously worked with Edwards on Godzilla (2014).",
        "On a production budget of $80 million, principal photography began in Thailand on January 17, 2022, with Greig Fraser (who was also a co-producer) and Oren Soffer as cinematographers, and COVID-19 safety precautions in place. To give the film the feel of classic Hollywood epics such as Ben-Hur (1959), the filmmakers opted to shoot in the 2.76:1 ultra-wide aspect ratio.",
        "Among the on-site filming locations in Thailand are Suvarnabhumi Airport, Ban Mung, Sangkhla Buri, Chiang Dao, and Sam Phan Bok. As the trailer was released, Thai fans also pointed out a scene shot at Makkasan station of Bangkok's ARL.",
        "For their duties, Fraser was involved in the pre-production process before moving to working remotely due to his commitment to Dune: Part Two (2024), while Soffer, for his first major studio film, served as the main director of photography throughout the production shoot. In an interview with Total Film, Edwards, who  was also a camera operator, commended Soffer and what he brought to the film, calling him a \"real future rising star in the DoP world. He's super-smart. He's got a great eye.\" The film was shot on the prosumer Sony FX3 camera, the low cost of which is a rarity for a blockbuster film. Edwards confirmed the camera's usage at the \"Directors on Directing\" panel at the 2023 San Diego Comic-Con, where director and fellow panelist Louis Leterrier noted that this creative decision could \"change cinema\" forever. In light of the budget, the filmmakers utilized guerrilla filmmaking methods by having very few crew members and natural lighting on set for select on-location scenes, and limited sound recording. Rather than building sets, or relying exclusively on digital methods such as greenscreens or StageCraft, the production found it was more cost effective to send a small crew to film in 80 locations around the world which came closest to matching the desired sci-fi look. Then, only once the producers had finalised the edit were visual effects layered into the images. Using this method, Edwards estimated the production spent only $80 million on a project which would have typically cost $300 million. Interior scenes and stuntwork was filmed at Pinewood Studios. Filming wrapped on May 30, 2022.",
        "The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, SDFX Studios, Yannix, Virtuos, Weta Workshop Folks VFX, MARZ, Misc Studios, Fin Design + Effects, Outpost VFX, Lekker VFX, Crafty Apes, Jellyfish Pictures, Proof, Territory Studio, Atomic Arts and VFX Los Angeles. James Clyne, who was a concept artist on Rogue One, reunited with Edwards on this film as its production designer.",
        "One of the film's most significant elements is the fictional U.S. military space station NOMAD, which was noted for its distinctive visual design and sound effects. Edwards revealed that it took the entirety of the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to design it, describing it as \"a bird of prey and an all-seeing eye in the sky, always looking at everybody. So we kept playing with those two shapes and merging them in a way until it just felt right.\" Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn, who worked with Edwards on Godzilla (2014), provided the ship's sound effects, describing them as \"a dance, is probably the nice way to say it, between music and sound, and it's never a fight\". The assembly cut of the film, which ran for five hours, did not use any temp tracks for the music and just the sound design, which Edwards likened to that of the talkies during the late-1920s. Because of this, it was decided that no music be added to the film throughout the entire editing process in order to get the pacing and story structure right in an efficient manner. Edwards called the experience \"super interesting. Part of me thinks that I would do that again, because it puts a lot of pressure on the sound design, but then you're not hiding behind music to save the storytelling.\""

    "Release": [
        "An early press and industry screening of The Creator, originally meant to have been its world premiere until being impacted by the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, took place at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on September 18, 2023, with props and costumes from the film on display in the lobby. Edwards was also present and voiced his support for the film's cast, who could not attend and promote the film due to the strikes, in a speech before the film began. The film held its Texas premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 26, 2023, with a special screening as the opening night film of Beyond Fest that same day at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California. The film's United Kingdom premiere took place on September 26, 2023, at The Science Museum, South Kensington in London.",
        "It was released on September 29, 2023 in both conventional theaters and in IMAX, Dolby Cinema, 4DX and ScreenX, just two days after the end of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. It competed for opening weekend attendance with Paramount Pictures' PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie and Lionsgate's Saw X. It was originally to be released on October 6, 2023 before it was announced at CinemaCon on April 26, 2023 that it would be moved up a week.",
        "The film was released on digital platforms on November 14, 2023, and was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on December 12 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment through the 20th Century Home Entertainment label, featuring a 55-minute featurette titled True Love: Making The Creator. It was made available to stream on Disney+ and Hulu, beginning on December 20, 2023. During its first week on Video on demand (VOD), it ranked number 1 on iTunes Movies and Vudu and number 3 on Google Play."

    "Reception": [
        "As of November\u00a019, 2023, The Creator has grossed $40.8\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $63.2\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $104\u00a0million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, it was released alongside PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie, Saw X, and the wide expansion of Dumb Money, and was projected to gross $16\u201319 million from 3,680 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $5.6 million on its first day, including $1.6 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $14.1 million, finishing third at the box office. $3 million of the gross came from IMAX screens, while men made up at 71% of the audience, with 51% between the ages of 18-34. The film made $6.1 million and $4.3 million in its second and third weekend, finishing fifth both times.",
        "Prior to its release, Cindy White of The A.V. Club cited the mid-teen estimates were due to it being an original film (not based on an existing IP), cast and filmmakers not being entirely household names (save for Washington and Janney), poor timing of the release in the midst of societal and governmental issues regarding generative AI's place in everyday life, and lackluster marketing and promotion due in-part to the ongoing 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Ben Sherlock of Screen Rant thought being released in the midst of public debates over AI was a positive for the film rather than a negative and attributed the poor performance to its Rotten Tomatoes score and the price of cinema tickets. Following its $14 million opening weekend, Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair expressed hope that the film could become a sleeper hit given its healthier performance overseas, saying: \"The film's plotting may be derivative, its twists and emotional beats predictable. But there is still something rare and special in its execution; it's Denis Villeneuve without the cold fussiness, the lacquered preening. Now that Edwards is free of Star Wars (though his Star Wars movie is a good one), he is a filmmaker to be fostered and encouraged, so that he might make ever more arresting entertainments like The Creator.\"",
        "The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its visual effects, cinematography, action sequences and Edwards' direction, but criticized the writing and themes. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 66% of 304 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Visually stunning and packed with spectacular set pieces, The Creator serves up timely, well-acted sci-fi that satisfies in the moment even if it lacks substance.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 81% overall positive score, with 61% saying they would definitely recommend the film.",
        "Maggie Lovitt of Collider wrote: \"The script might have glaring flaws and painfully ambiguous morals, but The Creator is a truly remarkable piece of original science fiction storytelling.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it: \"an intriguing, stimulating, exhilarating movie, which really does address \u2013 with both head and heart \u2013 the great issue of our age, AI.\" Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood called it: \"one of the most thought-provoking movies in some time, one to which attention must be paid.\"",
        "Brian Truitt of USA Today described it as \"a movie that makes you think about existence and the world around you, explodes your brain with cool visuals and sufficiently blows stuff up.\" Alex Godfrey of Empire called it: \"An inspired, soulful piece of sci-fi, the endlessly stunning visuals all in service of a heartfelt, sensitive story. Gareth Edwards is the real deal \u2014 this is fantastic, enveloping cinema.\"",
        "A.A. Dowd of IGN wrote: \"As pure spectacle, The Creator is often jaw-dropping in its imagery, its relatively frugal special effects, and the detailed depth of its futuristic design. It's shakier as drama and sci-fi...\" Graeme Guttmann of Screen Rant wrote: \"While the film's story may feel overstuffed and its action sequences repetitive at times, The Creator's bold vision and willingness to take risks make it a more exhilarating experience than safe, mediocre blockbusters.\"",
        "Tomris Laffly of TheWrap called it \"a film that works better as an allegory for acceptance rather than a warning against AI\", and that \"even if you can't look past such glaring miscalculations, The Creator will still feel like a visually fulfilling journey that had been worth taking in the aftermath. Nowadays, there is absolutely nothing like it out there.\"",
        "Joey Magidson of Awards Radar wrote: \"You've never seen anything quite like this movie, which is a saying that gets bandied about a lot, but is pretty apt here...There was potential for an instant classic movie. We're not quite there, but what we've got is still damn good,\" while naming it a frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.",
        "Jake Cole of Slant praised the visual effects, writing: \"The robots, which run a stylistic range from logical extrapolations of present-day models by companies like Boston Dynamics to the not-quite-perfect human simulacra of A.I. Artificial Intelligence, all look not only plausible but physically present.\" Rodrigo Perez of The Playlist called it \"A familiar m\u00e9lange and pastiche of sci-fi-tropes you've seen and felt before, filmmaker Gareth Edwards' science-fiction drama, The Creator, is recognizable but, nonetheless, largely compelling.\"",
        "Reviews were not uniformly positive. David Ehrlich of IndieWire described it as \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence meets Children of Men\" and wrote that \"The most fundamental reason why The Creator, for all of its shortcomings and clich\u00e9s, ultimately sold me on its optimism is that it succeeds as a blueprint where it fails as a movie.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter was mixed, calling it a \"baggy, sentimental sci-fi epic,\" while Peter Debruge of Variety thought that it \"can hardly even keep its premise straight\".",
        "Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"fails to develop the personalities and relationships that would give its central characters an affecting humanity.\" Jesse Hassenger of Paste wrote: \"For a designated last great hope of original sci-fi, this is a surprisingly programmatic picture.\"",
        "Rafael Motamayor of /Film called it \"visually stunning\" but \"a predictable and dumbed-down story that feels like Edwards doing James Cameron's Avatar in terms of presenting bold worldbuilding and sci-fi ideas, but without the emotional resonance of that giant film. This is a very cool movie, but not necessarily a very good one.\" Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times felt the film lacked originality, writing: \"there's precious little in The Creator that feels fresh, particularly if you\u2019ve seen one of the first two Terminator movies, watched The Last of Us or bought your kid (OK, yourself) a Baby Yoda plush toy.\"",
        "Fionnuala Halligan of Screen International wrote that it \"lacks the intellectual depth or ambition of the films it references - from Apocalypse Now to Blade Runner, The Terminator, Star Wars and beyond to the imagery of Kundun.\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times criticized the film's tone, and wrote: \"Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A.I. inescapably looms.\"",
        "Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times called it: \"A great-looking but strange and mostly unsuccessful hybrid of futuristic sci-fi thrillers and Vietnam War films that combines elements of everything from District 9 to Blade Runner to Ex Machina to the Terminator franchise...\"",
        "The film was shortlisted in the categories of Best Sound and Best Visual Effects at the 96th Academy Awards, ultimately being nominated in both categories, and was longlisted in the categories of Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects at the 77th British Academy Film Awards, ultimately being nominated in the latter category. Special effects supervisor Neil Corbould garnered a rare trifecta of Best Visual Effects nominations in a single year, for his work on this film,  Napoleon, and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One."
