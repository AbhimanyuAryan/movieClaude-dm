        "By the year 2065, fresh water and habitable land have become scarce, the cities overcrowded and the rural places abandoned. A young couple, Hen and Junior, have stayed on at Junior\u2019s family farm. Hen stands in the shower, sobbing uncontrollably. A voiceover intones \u201cI\u2019ve lost those parts of who I am or who I could be, and I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t ever get them back.\u201d",
        "That night a man who calls himself Terrance visits. He says he represents OuterMore, the corporation organizing the off-world colony. He says there was a lottery. Junior made the shortlist. The testing process takes about two years. Stunned, Junior asks what will happen if he refuses. Terrance speaks of the days of the old wars and refers to the word conscription. This is just a warning, he says, then catches himself. It is good news: Junior will be a hero to mankind.",
        "After Terrance leaves, Hen goes straight to bed and asks Junior to sleep in the guest room. Taken aback, Junior suggests Hen knew Terrance was coming. And what about the way Terrance was looking at Hen? Eventually he leaves the room. For a time Hen and Junior live separate lives on the homestead. Then one morning after some time Hen approaches Junior\u2019s bed. She watches the sleeping body. She takes his hand and places it against her. After they make love, Junior says he has always been happy and has never doubted their marriage. For a time things are alright. Hen cries now and then. One day she finds herself standing in the field by the tree trying to push her face into a smile. But mostly things are alright.",
        "A year later Terrance returns. He announces that Junior is scheduled to leave in two weeks. As Hen and Junior attempt to protest, Terrance states that he will be staying in the house to observe Junior. After further protests, Hen and Junior grow silent.",
        "Terrance is shown living in the house, interviewing Junior and administering unusual tests. One night, Terrance and Hen drink and carouse while Junior looks on feebly. Later, Junior notices an unusual bug on the ground. It is not moving. Junior points this out. Hen says nothing. They see a fire in the distance. As Hen gazes spellbound, Junior begins running toward it. Hen runs after him. Junior keeps running and just as he appears to run into the fire two shadowy figures tackle him.",
        "Junior awakes in bandages, Hen and Terrance watching him. He was injured, they say. The fire was started by men burning an old barn. Terrance intensifies his monitoring, explaining that Junior\u2019s replacement will need to know what Junior knows. Wandering through the house, Junior finds a recording of Terrance interviewing Hen. In the recording, Hen frets over how she has lost parts of who she is and is scared she won\u2019t ever get them back. Terrance\u2019s voice is heard assuring her that the replacement will be all but identical.",
        "Junior is declining. One day, Junior sees shadowy figures on the perimeter of the property and chases them away with a shotgun. That night, Terrance puts metal wristbands on Junior. He says they are for monitoring Junior\u2019s hydration. \nThe next morning Hen sits waiting in the kitchen. She is wearing a dress. Outside, a vehicle approaches. Junior steps into the kitchen and embraces Hen, saying how he has missed her. After a moment, they walk into the next room where Terrance and a team from OuterMore are working. Junior stares in fascination at a body shackled to the floor. It is identical to his. Terrance is talking, marveling at OuterMore\u2019s success. He says they never expected Hen and the replacement to fall in love. He says people will write about it for years. Members of the OuterMore team approach the shackled figure with a syringe. Outside, Hen lays in the dirt weeping.",
        "Hen and Junior try to rekindle their relationship but they are different now and it is no good. One morning Junior wakes to the sound of a truck leaving. For a time Junior goes on with his life. Terrance is seen visiting the house. After this, Hen returns. She sits still and upright and does not cry. Junior is happier now and it seems Hen is happier too and they make love in the evening and drink beer on the porch. One morning Hen notices an unusual bug. It is not moving. Hen points this out. Junior says nothing.",
        "In the city on the other side of the valley Hen gazes out the window of a plane as the crew makes final preparations for take-off."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 24% of 111 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan give it all they've got, but they're ultimately undone by Foe's clunky sci-fi trappings and ponderous attempts to generate psychological thrills.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Luke Goodsell wrote for ABC Arts after its release in Australia: \"Oscar nominees Ronan and Mescal are both charismatic, gripping performers, and they give Hen and Junior a rich sense of lived-in love and loathing. But despite the stars' best, hot-and-bothered exertion, Davis and Reid's screenplay eventually hangs them out to dry\"."
