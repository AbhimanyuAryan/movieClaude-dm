    "Plot": [
        "An elderly Joe Rantz watches his grandson rowing a fiberglass boat, thinking back to his glorious rowing days. In 1936, young Joe Rantz is a poor engineering student at the University of Washington (UW), living in an abandoned car and eating canned food, with no job and tuition due in two weeks. Fellow struggling student Roger Morris tells Joe the 8+ rowing team comes with jobs and boarding. Despite not being rowers, they make the UW junior varsity (JV) team in a special year for coach Al Ulbrickson, who is under pressure to beat rival Cal and make the 1936 Olympics. Joe and Roger are just happy to have a dorm room and steady food, and gladly mop floors for tuition. Joe starts dating Joyce and admits to racing-shell builder George Pocock that he\u2019s been on his own since his dad abandoned him at age thirteen.",
        "The JV and varsity 8+ teams train together, trying to get their rowing \"swing\" in sync with fast pace. Coach Al worries that his varsity crew isn\u2019t fast enough for the Olympics, and the JVs are strong but inexperienced. On George's suggestion, Al brings back Bobby Moch, the experienced but headstrong coxswain, warning him to follow orders on the JVs or he\u2019s out. At the Pacific Coast Regatta on Lake Washington, UW and Cal race two miles in front of 100,000 fans.  Coach Al wants the JV boat to maintain a steady pace, hoping the Cal JVs would screw up, but Bobby calls a fast pace and pulls off a course-record win, astonishing Al. The rowers become campus stars.",
        "Ahead of the four-mile Poughkeepsie Regatta in New York, for a berth in the Olympics, Al risks his job by promoting the JVs above his experieced varsity boat. After Joe sees his long-lost dad in Seattle, he performs badly in New York practice and is benched. Joe packs up to leave, but George Pocock tells him not to quit like his father.  Joe reconsiders and agrees with Al that it\u2019s all about the boat, the only thing he has. On race day, Bobby is told by Al to start slowly and let the other boats tire, then kick mid-race to 35 strokes per minute.  Bobby starts at 28 and holds it past mid-race, then coaxes 36, with a 40-stroke finish to lead ragtag UW to upset Navy, Cal, and the other privileged eastern schools.",
        "The U.S. Olympic Committee is short on funds, so UW needs to raise $5,000 to pay for their travel, otherwise a richer team will go. The team and community raise the money in a week, and they sail for Berlin. In Nazi Germany, eighth-seat rower Don Hume immediately falls sick. At the opening ceremony, Roger tells Jesse Owens to show the Germans that he's the fastest guy in the world. Owens replies, \"not the Germans, the folks back home\". The team then sets an Olympic record in the qualifier, but it takes a toll on Hume. Al protests the finals lane assignments, but realizes he\u2019ll have calm water at the end, so he calls for a fast start to stay close to the great German team, then a big kick to finish. Adolf Hitler attends the finals expecting his 8+ team to complete a German gold-medal sweep of the rowing events. Bobby fails to hear the finals starting gun and starts badly, with Hume struggling early; nonetheless, Bobby coaxes Hume and the crew to 42 strokes per minute to get within reach, then calls for 46 with 300 meters to go. The U.S. wins the gold in a photo finish over Italy and Germany, to the team's jubilation and much to Hitler's chagrin. The elderly Joe comes out of his reverie and tells his grandson that his eight-man crew were always one."

The website's consensus reads: \"The Boys in the Boat tells its inspirational true story with heart and solid craftsmanship, but director George Clooney's solidly traditional approach prevents it from leaving much of an impact.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 86% filmgoers gave it a positive score.",
        "Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"At times The Boys in the Boat could have used more of an edge. But like the Huskies, it gets the job done, stumbling sometimes but mostly assured.\" Bilge Ebiri of Vulture called the film \"an unshowy but slick underdog sports picture, fluidly told and elegantly mounted.\" The Messenger's Jordan Hoffman gave the film a score of 6.2/10, writing, \"'It's a bit old fashioned' is the primary takeaway most have from The Boys in the Boat, and what that really means is low-stakes, relaxing and predictable, but also basically good.\"",
        "CNN's Brian Lowry wrote, \"the movie can't really escape the whirlpool-like drag of its earnest familiarity, paddling around in a middle lane that doesn't rival the most stirring practitioners of this well-worn genre.\" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the film 2/5 stars, writing, \"Clooney is capable of putting much more on the scoreboard; this feels like an animatronic museum display.\""
