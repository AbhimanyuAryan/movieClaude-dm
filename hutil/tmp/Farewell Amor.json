He has since settled in New York where he works as a cab driver. His wife Esther and daughter Sylvia are just now able to join him in the US after 17 years apart. Both Walter and Esther have found ways to cope with the time and distance apart\u2014with Walter carrying on a new relationship, and Esther finding community in the church. Walter regretfully breaks up with his girlfriend Linda prior to his family\u2019s arrival. In Brooklyn, the family of three must share a one-bedroom apartment. Esther finds herself struggling not only to adjust to a new country and culture, but also to a distant husband and a marriage that has seemingly lost its fire. The teenage Sylvia also struggles with homesickness, but pursues dance against the wishes of her mother.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nNtare Mwine as Walter\nZainab Jah as Esther\nJayme Lawson as Sylvia\nJoie Lee as Nzingha\nMarcus Scribner as DJ\nNana Mensah as Linda\nBrandon Lamar as Tall Handsome\nFelipe Almonte as Loving Boyfriend\nDylan Flashner as MC\nSanjit De Silva as Mr. Uno\nDarlene Arrington as Dirty Dozen\nJoel Michaely as Aubrey\nSoul\u00e9ymane Sy Savan\u00e9 as Pastor Ogunbemi\nRelease[edit]\nIt was released on December 11, 2020 in the USA.

Its beauty lies in its empathy \u2014 something currently in short supply and therefore very welcome in the stories we consume.\"[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Gheron, Meghan (January 23, 2020). \"Sundance 2020 Women Directors: Ekwa Msangi - \"Farewell Amor\"\".
