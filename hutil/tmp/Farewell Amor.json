        "Farewell Amor was praised for its acting and direction.  Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Crust wrote, \"Though the film is shaped by big topics such as immigration, race, identity and religion, its power lies in its universality achieved through the small human details that tell its story of love and family. Its beauty lies in its empathy \u2014 something currently in short supply and therefore very welcome in the stories we consume.\""
