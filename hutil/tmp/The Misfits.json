        "Richard Pace is a professional thief, as well as a prison escapee. Schultz, who owns several private prisons (3 of which Pace has escaped from), learns that Pace is about to be released from one of his prisons, but escapes the day before, when Schultz comes to visit.\nIt's revealed that Pace only stayed in the prison so he could get information from his roommate about a wealthy man known as The Prince, who is currently in Los Angeles. Pace goes to a hotel where the Prince is staying, trying to steal the Prince's valuable watch collection, with Schultz & the FBI behind. However, he realizes too late that it's a trap set by The Prince. Forced to choose between The Prince and the FBI, Pace chooses the former, who takes him to his private plane. There, he meets three other members: Ringo - a locksmith and master of disguise, Wick - an explosives expert, and Violet - a deadly martial artist. Together, they make up The Misfits.",
        "On The Prince's private plane, en route to Abu Dhabi, the Misfits learn that Schultz has taken money from a Brotherhood & has laundered it, converting it into gold. Schultz has kept the gold in a safe hidden in another prison of his, located in the fictional country of Jazeristan. The Misfits want to steal the gold to prevent the Brotherhood from using it to fund terrorist attacks, but they need Pace's help. Pace initially refuses to help, but after a chance meeting with his daughter, Hope, Pace decides to help. However, Pace wants 50% of the gold they steal. After the Misfits tell them that they are not keeping the gold at all, Pace decides to leave, but is stopped when he learns Hope brought them all together.\nWhile preparing to infiltrate the Jazeristan prison, the Misfits learn that the leader of the Brotherhood, Abu Hirawa, has sent his right-hand man, Jason Quick, to pick up a case of gold bars from Schultz. However, the Misfits decide to swap the case. Enraged, Hirawa kills Quick, then lets Schultz know that he's coming directly to Jazeristan to pick up the gold bars from him, on the same day as the heist. \nOnce in Jazeristan, Ringo disguises himself to convince the prison warden that the kitchen ovens need to be replaced. On the day the ovens are replaced, Pace & Wick switch places with The Prince's contacts, disguising themselves as prisoners. While moving the ovens, Pace sees a statue that's meant to honor Schultz. In anger, he damages the statue. \nThe next day, they poison the cafeteria food, causing major vomiting and diarrhea in all of the prisoners, resulting in multiple prisoners being relocated to a nearby hospital via ambulances. Suspicious, Schultz believes that Pace is in Jazeristan trying to steal his gold, and asks his men to locate him. Meanwhile, Ringo comes to the prison disguised as the owner of a sanitation company, telling the warden he\u2019ll need to bring people in with hazmat suits. Pace & Wick go into one of the prisoners\u2019 bathrooms directly above the safe, under the guise of cleaning it, while Hope parks a car outside. After drilling through the safe, Wick fills it with gas, then lights a fire, causing the safe door to explode open. At the same time, Hope\u2019s car explodes, convincing the guards that the explosion only came from the car. \nAfter the explosion, Pace & Wick go to the safe room to remove the gold. Before they do so, Wick takes a photo of the gold with his phone, and attaches it to a security camera in the safe. Meanwhile, Schultz, believing that the car\u2019s explosion was only a diversion, asks the prison security to check the safe\u2019s camera. At first, they only see Wick\u2019s photo, but when Schultz asks to zoom in, the camera doesn\u2019t move. Schultz goes to the safe room only to see that all the gold has been removed. As Schultz tells the guards to lock down the prison, a gurney moves past him, dropping a gold bar. Believing that Pace has used the gurneys and ambulances to move the gold, he orders his men to check the ambulances. However, they find nothing.\nBack at the prison, Schultz sees an unfamiliar sanitation truck drive past. He gets in his car and orders his men to follow it through the desert, before the truck stops in front of a military plane belonging to The Prince. Schultz opens the truck\u2019s trunk, expecting to the find the gold, but is surprised when it is empty. At this time, The Prince, Ringo, and two others (with their faces masked) exit the truck. Schultz is angry, but is calmed when he receives a phone call from his men, claiming they have found Hope. Schultz tells them to kill her, then hangs up. However, one of the masked people is revealed to be Hope, and introduces herself to Schultz. The person Schultz\u2019s men had tied up was actually Violet, who attacks them all and leaves. Schultz, angry, pulls out a gun, but is then held at gunpoint himself by military forces from The Prince\u2019s country. The military forces then escort Schultz towards a car belonging to Hirawa. While Hirawa understands that Schultz is not at fault, he tells him that justice must be delivered.\nIt's revealed that Ringo, Wick, and two of the Prince\u2019s men (who had already infiltrated the prison), had used Schultz\u2019s statue to create a mold, and melted the gold so it was in the shape of the damaged statue. After painting it, Ringo then left the prison as someone coming to take the statue for repairs.\nAfter reuniting in Abu Dhabi, Hope & Pace decide to officially join the Misfits, as a news report mentions how a large donation was given to charity, and that the price of gold is on the rise."
