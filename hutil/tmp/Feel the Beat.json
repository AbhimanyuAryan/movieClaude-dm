She performs well, but sponsor Ruth Zimmer, meets the potential dancers. When she recognizes April (from the taxi incident), she vows that no one on Broadway will hire her. While trying to explain, she accidentally knocks Ruth off stage, inflicting serious injury. It is posted on social media, publicly embarrassing April.\nEvicted, April returns to her hometown in Wisconsin. While at the grocery store, she bumps into the New Hope dance teacher Miss Barb, who invites her to come to the dance studio. April also sees her ex Nick, whom she left to pursue a career in New York City.\nIn the dance studio, she visits the class of dancers: Lucia, a forgetful girl with glasses; Oona, a nervous girl; Kari, who secretly earns her own classes; Ruby, with no self-confidence; Zuzu, a deaf girl; June, Miss Barb's daughter; Sarah, Nick\u2019s stubborn little sister; and Michelle, Nick\u2019s other little sister and the youngest. Zuzu\u2019s little brother, Dicky, also watches.\nBarb asks April to coach the town's dance team for a competition. At first, she declines, but later realizes it can give her a chance to perform in front of Welly Wong, saving her career. April accepts, beginning a harsh training regimen that alienates the young dancers, including causing Ruby to quit.\nThe New Hope dance team advances through several rounds of the competition; they improve as April bonds with them, becoming a better teacher, including learning some sign language to communicate with Zuzu. One day, the dance studio ceiling collapses after April tells the dancers they \"don't suck,\" so they know they are improving. Unable to afford repairs to the studio, the team moves practice to the football field and eventually move to April's father's barn, which Nick has helped repair.\nApril and Nick begin to rekindle their relationship as the dance team advances to state. Dancers from another troupe taunt her about her failure in New York, causing her to lose focus during one dance, though she recovers.\nIn the mini\u2019s 6-and-under category, the two youngest dancers, June and Michelle, are struck with stage fright. Dicky, who has memorized all the girl's choreography while they practiced, runs out and starts to dance. June and Michelle recover, and they all dance together. Dicky now trains with the dance troupe.\nAfter passing state finals, April calls her NYC friend Deco to help make costumes. One day, as the small dancers are rehearsing a lift in the barn, April calls on Sarah and R.J., the football player whom Sarah has a crush and she wants to impress, to demonstrate. When R.J. lifts her, her silicone bra cup falls on the floor, and she runs off, embarrassed and crying. April finds her in the field and comforts her.\nThe dancers' families raise the money to send the team to Atlantic City for the finals. April reconnects with Nick's younger sister Sarah, who had felt abandoned when her mother died and April moved to New York. Once in Atlantic City, after a performance, Welly Wong is so impressed with April he offers her the lead in his new show on the spot. April and Welly leave the competition immediately for rehearsal in NYC, devastating the team.\nThe next day, April realizes her mistake and abandons the rehearsal, proclaiming to Welly that she must honor her commitment to New Hope. She calls Deco again to drive her back to Atlantic City just in time to encourage the team before the performance. After reconciling with her dancers, April and Nick kiss, and Welly keeps her on despite leaving rehearsal.\nApril performs in Welly Wong's show in NYC and continues teaching her dance class in Wisconsin via video chat. On opening night, Welly surprises April by bringing the New Hope team over for a dance party. Everyone dances in the street, and Ruth Zimmer drives by momentarily, appalled.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nSofia Carson as April Dibrina\nWolfgang Novogratz as Nick\nDonna Lynne Champlin as Barb\nRex Lee as Wellington 'Welly' Wong\nBrandon Kyle Goodman as Deco\nEva Hauge as Sarah\nMarissa Jaret Winokur as Herself\nEnrico Colantoni as Frank Dibrina\nLidya Jewett as Kari\nSadie Lapidus as Oona\nJohanna Col\u00f3n as Lucia\nShaylee Mansfield as Zuzu\nShiloh Nelson as Ruby\nJustin Allan as Dicky\nCarina Battrick as Michelle\nKai Zen as June\nDennis Andres as Buzz\nRobinne Fanfair as Patty\nKen Pak as Gordy\nMarcia Bennett as Grandma\nDrew Davis as R.J.\nPamela MacDonald as Ruth Zimmer\nAmy Stewart as Carla\nRelease[edit]\nFeel the Beat was released on June 19, 2020.[1]\n\nReception[edit]\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 50% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10.[3]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nThe film's soundtrack includes:[4]\n\n\"Let's Do It\" - All Talk\n\"Work Dat (So Dat)\" - Kylie Diehl\n\"Hand of Man\" - Country Joe & The Fish\n\"Round and Round\" - Jack Hawitt\n\"Brand New Day\" - Kari Kimmel\n\"Never Forgive You\" - Brooke Villanyi\n\"Wish You Was Me\" - Lauren Evans\n\"Glitter Shoes\" - Blaire Reinhard\n\"Confident\" - Demi Lovato\n\"Us\" - Regina Spektor\n\"Deal With It\" - Girli\n\"Pumpin Blood\" - NoNoNo\n\"Yes or Yes\" - Tricia Battani\n\"I'm Gonna Do My Thing (Hey Hey)\" - Mozella\n\"Like That\" - Fleur East\n\"Colors\" - Wayfarers\n\"Follow the Leader\" - Wayfarers\n\"Winner Won't Stop\" - Neara Russell\n\"Always\" (Acoustic) - Francois Klark\n\"A Little More\" - Alessia Cara\n\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\" - C+C Music Factory\n\"All I Wanna Do Is Dance\" - Mozella\n\"Always\" - Sofia Carson[5]\nSee also[edit]\n\nFilm portal\nList of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"'Feel the Beat': Trailer, Cast, Release Date, and What To Know About the Know About the Netflix Film\".
