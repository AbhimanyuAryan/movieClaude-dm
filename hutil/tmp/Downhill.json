The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fittingly named for a remake whose charms are dwarfed by its superior source material, Downhill is frequently -- and frustratingly -- less than the sum of its talented parts.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 1 out of 5 stars, with 26% of people saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "On RogerEbert.com, Nick Allen gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying, \"It's yet another instance in which it's hard to not think about what could have been, especially since the original did it so much better.\""
