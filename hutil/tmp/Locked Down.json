    "Plot": [
        "Paxton and Linda are a disgruntled couple living in London during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Paxton is only able to get jobs as a delivery truck driver due to an assault arrest 10 years prior and is upset about how his life has turned out. Linda is a CEO at a marketing company, who is forced to lay off several employees over video calls and struggles with the questionable decisions of her company's executives.",
        "Both Paxton and Linda experience various existential crises over their situations, leading Paxton to try organic opiates after years of sobriety and Linda to begin smoking cigarettes and drinking.",
        "Due to stores being shut down, there are a limited amount of drivers available for high-value deliveries, so Paxton's boss asks him to make runs under a false identity for him. Linda is tasked with clearing out inventory from a fashion display she planned at the nearby Harrods department store. She soon realizes their delivery schedules at the store overlap, and Paxton would not get past the security checkpoint Linda has set up.",
        "Linda discloses that there is a \u00a33 million diamond in the vault at Harrods that has been sold to a morally dubious anonymous buyer who would not inspect the diamond for years after its arrival, and that the store keeps a duplicate on location. She and Paxton debate taking the real diamond for themselves and send the fake one to the buyer in New York City, splitting the sale between themselves and the National Health Service. They weigh the moral and criminal implications involved in stealing the diamond, and ultimately decide to wait until the diamond is in their possession to make the choice.",
        "Upon making it to the store, Linda and Paxton retrieve the diamond and finally decide swap it out with the fake. However, they are confronted by Donald, a former co-worker of Linda's she was told to fire earlier in the week. Donald had called the police after learning of Paxton's fake identity. Linda reveals their plan, and Donald, having suffered his own moral and existential crisis similar to Paxton and Linda, agrees to lie for them.",
        "Paxton and Linda, who originally planned to go their separate ways, decide to reevaluate their relationship. Then the COVID lockdown is extended by another two weeks."

        "The film was announced in September 2020 as Lockdown, with Doug Liman directing a screenplay that Steven Knight had written that July over a dare. Anne Hathaway was announced to star, with filming set to start later that month in London. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ben Stiller, Lily James, Stephen Merchant, Dul\u00e9 Hill, Jazmyn Simon, and Mark Gatiss were also announced as cast members. In October 2020, Mindy Kaling, Ben Kingsley, and Lucy Boynton were added to the cast of the film, with Boynton replacing James. Claes Bang, Sam Spruell and Frances Ruffelle were revealed as members of the cast in January 2021.",
        "The film was shot over the course of 18 days. Due to the limited resources and short production window the order of several scenes needed to be adjusted, forcing Hathaway and Ejiofor to tape their un-memorized lines around set. Despite initial reports it had a budget of $10 million, Liman insisted the actual cost of the film \"started with a three.\" The UK-based company Koala FX was responsible for the advance clean up.",
        "John Powell scored the film making it the first time he worked with Doug Liman since Fair Game in 2010."

    "Reception": [
        "On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Locked Down holds an approval rating of 42% based on 115 reviews, with an average of 5.00/10. The website's critics consensus states, \"Locked Down combines a heist caper, a relationship drama, and pandemic-era timeliness to produce a film that's frustratingly less than the sum of its parts.\" According to Metacritic, which sampled 33 mainstream critics and calculated a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a B and wrote: \"Yes, Locked Down is a heist movie, though one that's more concerned with 'stealing back the things that you feel life owes you than it is with priceless jewels... COVID-19 serves as a fitting backdrop for an amiable romp about the freedoms we take for granted, and the confines that dictated our lives long before we were forced to spend them at home.\" Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that \"in spite of the available chemistry and charisma from Hathaway and Ejiofor, Locked Down proves to be a bewildering mess.\" Erik Nielsen of Little White Lies criticised the film and wrote: \"a tone-deaf pandemic crime caper\" and \"affluent couple plot an audacious diamond heist in the Covid movie absolutely no one needed\" scoring the film with a 1/5 rating."
