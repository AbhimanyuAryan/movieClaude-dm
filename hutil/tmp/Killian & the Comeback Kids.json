        "Killian returns home after his college graduation before heading off on a modest musical tour with his bandmate Ben. When Ben abandons their plan in favor of a stable A&R job Killian finds himself stuck in the once prosperous Pennsylvania steel-town. When it's announced that the major music festival that comes to town every summer is finally open to local acts, Killian gathers a group of former childhood friends and acquaintances, all of whom have returned home after college degrees, in an attempt to win the gig. Elements of the film are based on the real life withdrawal of Bethlehem Steel and creation of Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania."

    "Release": [
        "During the COVID-19 pandemic it was announced that Hope Runs High had acquired distribution rights for the film.",
        "The film was released on September 18, 2020, making Killian & the Comeback Kids one of the first new films to play in American theaters during the pandemic, and one of the only independent films released exclusively to theaters.  Due to its \"platform release\" structure, during its first few weeks it was sometimes the only fully theatrical film opening in a given city, marking the first time in history that this happened.",
        "With Killian & the Comeback Kids, Purdee became the youngest director of the year with a film in major US cinema circuits, a trend that repeated itself the next year upon the film's 2021 continued release. The initial release also made him the first mixed-race director/star of African American heritage to have a narrative film released to US theatres in the 21st century.",
        "According to an early 2021 interview with the director, the film was slated to open again exclusively in cinemas that remained closed for the entirety of the 2020 leg of the coronavirus outbreak, in September 2021 before ever becoming available digitally.",
        "The film did return to theatres in September 2021 after the reopening of major moviegoing markets and played another fully theatrical national run. The film was not released online until August 2022 making for one of the most unique theatrical release patterns of the COVID era."

Lots more...Killlian & the Comeback Kids lingers long after you've left the movie theatre.\"",
