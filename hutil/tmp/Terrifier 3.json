It stars Lauren LaVera, Elliott Fullam, David Howard Thornton, and Samantha Scaffidi, who reprise their roles from prior films. The film is a sequel to Terrifier 2 (2022) and will reintroduce possessed survivor Victoria Heyes in a more prominent role. \nThe third film is centered around Art the Clown and is the fourth feature-length film to include the character (after the anthology film All Hallows' Eve), in the Terrifier franchise. The film is scheduled to be released theatrically on October 25, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nArt the Clown unleashes chaos on the unsuspecting residents of Miles County as they peacefully drift off to sleep on Christmas Eve.\u2014\u200aTerrifier 3[2]\nCast[edit]\nLauren LaVera as Sienna Shaw\nElliot Fullam as Jonathan Shaw\nSamantha Scaffidi as Victoria Heyes\nDavid Howard Thornton as Art the Clown\nChris Jericho as Burke\nDaniel Roebuck as Santa Claus\nProduction[edit]\nCasting[edit]\nThis film will feature the character of Victoria Heyes, the heroine turned villainess of Terrifier (2016), in a much more prominent role compared to the 2016 film and its 2022 sequel\u2014with Damien Leone's biggest regret with the first film being leaving her underdeveloped. The original ending of Terrifier 2 set up Victoria's demise in the opening of this film, but Leone deemed it to be too similar to the concept of Malignant (2021). While conceptualizing the birthing scene, he decided he wanted to keep Victoria alive and give her significant character development, as he enjoyed working with Samantha Scaffidi.[3][4][5]\nIn December 2023, it was confirmed that Chris Jericho was set to appear in Terrifier 3.[6][7] In April 2024, it was confirmed that Daniel Roebuck was set to appear as Santa Claus in Terrifier 3.[8]\n\nFilming[edit]\nIn May 2023, it was announced that Terrifier 3 was expected to begin filming in November or December 2023.[9] Principal photography began in February 2024 and wrapped in April 2024.[1][10][11]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn June 2023, Cineverse acquired the North American distribution rights to the film and set a wide theatrical release, with an exclusive streaming debut on its Screambox service.[12] The film is scheduled to be released theatrically on October 25, 2024.[13][14][15]\n\nSequel[edit]\nIn 2023, Damien Leone spoke about plans for a potential Terrifier 4.[16][17][18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Wiseman, Andreas (December 12, 2023). \"Terrifier 3: Director Damien Leone & Star Lauren LaVera Lift The Lid On Next Installment In Breakout Horror Franchise & What Could Come After\".
