        "This film will feature the character of Victoria Heyes, the heroine turned villainess of Terrifier (2016), in a much more prominent role compared to the 2016 film and its 2022 sequel\u2014with Damien Leone's biggest regret with the first film being leaving her underdeveloped. The original ending of Terrifier 2 set up Victoria's demise in the opening of this film, but Leone deemed it to be too similar to the concept of Malignant (2021). While conceptualizing the birthing scene, he decided he wanted to keep Victoria alive and give her significant character development, as he enjoyed working with Samantha Scaffidi.",
