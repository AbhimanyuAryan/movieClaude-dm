It stars Tilda Swinton in a double role, as both a middle-aged filmmaker and her elderly mother who are guests at a mysterious hotel. Joseph Mydell and Carly-Sophia Davies are featured in supporting roles.\nThe Eternal Daughter premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on 6 September 2022, and was released in the United States on 2 December 2022 by A24.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMiddle-aged filmmaker Julie takes her elderly mother, Rosalind, to a secluded and seemingly empty hotel. Julie's father has recently died and Julie wants to spend time with her mother with the hope of making a film about her. Shrouded in an eerie fog, the hotel is a former family home of Rosalind's and she recounts painful memories that occurred at the location, including a miscarriage and the death of a family member during World War II. Julie begins to regret dredging up these memories but Rosalind assures her that it's not her fault and she has had happy memories at the childhood home as well.\nOne night, Julie walks into her room to find her mother's dog gone. She searches the grounds frantically, enlisting the help of Bill, a hotel employee. Rosalind returns to the room and finds the dog sitting on the bed. She thanks Bill for his help and they share a drink as they bond over their shared grief\u2014Julie's father and Bill's wife, who has also died recently. The following day, Julie overhears Rosalind talking with Bill. Rosalind says she feels sorry for Julie because she has no children of her own and dotes on her mother instead.\nOn Rosalind's birthday, Julie prepares a special supper for her, but when Rosalind says she is not hungry, Julie breaks down. She feels she cannot be happy when her mother is not happy and that she fears for the future as she has no children to take care of her when she is older. While bringing her mother a birthday cake, she cries and it is revealed that she is alone at the table and that her mother died in the past.\nThe following day, Julie works on her screenplay and then prepares to depart. As she leaves the hotel it is revealed to be full of guests and staff. The receptionist seems visibly concerned for Julie, who with the help of Bill gets into a taxi. The fog around the hotel gradually clears.\n\nCast[edit]\nThe cast includes:[4]\n\nTilda Swinton as Julie and Rosalind Hart\nJoseph Mydell as Bill\nCarly-Sophia Davies as Hotel receptionist\nCrispin Buxton as Cousin\nLouis as Louis the dog\nProduction[edit]\nOn January 18, 2021, it was announced that a film written and directed by Joanna Hogg and starring Tilda Swinton had wrapped.[5] On January 27, 2021, it was confirmed that A24 acquired the worldwide distribution rights.[6][7]\nThe film was shot in Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on 6 September 2022.[2][8] It also screened at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival[9][10] and the 60th New York Film Festival.[11][12] It was released in the United States on 2 December 2022.
