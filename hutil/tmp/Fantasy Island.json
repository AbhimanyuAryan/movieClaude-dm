Serving both as a horror reimagining and a prequel to ABC's 1977 television series of the same name, it stars Michael Pe\u00f1a, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, Portia Doubleday, and Michael Rooker and follows a group of people who, while visiting the eponymous island, discover that their dream-like fantasies brought to life begin to turn into horrific living nightmares and they must try to survive.[3]\nFantasy Island was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020 by Sony Pictures Releasing to generally negative reviews from critics. The film was a box office success, grossing $49 million worldwide against its $7 million production budget.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nBusinesswoman Gwen Olsen, former police officer Patrick Sullivan, step-brothers J. D. and Brax Weaver, and  Melanie Cole arrive at Fantasy Island, a tropical resort where fantasies apparently come true. Upon arrival, island proprietor Mr. Roarke guides the guests to their fantasies: Patrick is enlisted in a war in honor of his late father; the Weavers become honor guests at a mansion rave; Melanie takes revenge on her childhood bully Sloane Maddison; and Gwen accepts her ex-boyfriend Allen Chambers' marriage proposal, which she rejected many years ago.\nMelanie learns that Sloane was kidnapped and brought to Fantasy Island against her will. She saves her from a masked surgeon and both run away. Meanwhile, Patrick is captured by a military platoon and taken to their commander, Lieutenant Sullivan, whom Patrick recognizes as his father. As night falls, the surgeon attacks Melanie and Sloane again before Damon, a private investigator, kills him. Damon reveals that Roarke offered him to see his deceased daughter again. However, his fantasy turned into a nightmare that trapped him on the island. He also explains that the fantasies are created by spring water under a glowing rock in a cave. The trio collect some spring water and head to the resort for help. Gwen wakes up the next morning to find she has a daughter with Allen and becomes dissatisfied. When Roarke explains that the fantasies must be fulfilled so that his own fantasy of being with his deceased wife can continue, Gwen convinces him to give her the fantasy she really wanted: to save a neighbor who died in a fire.\nUnknown to the guests, Fantasy Island begins to turn the fantasies into living nightmares as the Weavers are taken hostage by a drug cartel associated with the mansion's owner, and Gwen is taken to the night she accidentally started a fire that killed her neighbor Nick Taylor. She finds out that the other guests, except Melanie, were also there and attempts to save Nick, fails and is rescued by Roarke's assistant, Julia. Elsewhere, Sullivan's soldiers are summoned to rescue the Weavers. After being shot dead, the cartel reanimate as zombies who attack the soldiers. In the ensuing gunfight, J. D. is fatally shot and Sullivan sacrifices himself so Patrick and Brax can escape.\nMelanie and Sloane are ambushed by the zombified surgeon until Damon leaps over a cliff with him, saving them at the cost of his own life. The remaining guests regroup at the resort, but are cornered by Roarke, who reveals that they are in a fantasy in which they are all killed. Realizing that everyone was involved in Nick's death (Melanie says that Nick asked her out that night and she turned him down, which is the reason he was in the apartment), the guests assume it is Julia's fantasy as they believe that Julia was Nick's mother. The guests escape to the dock to be rescued by a plane sent by Damon's associates, but it is shot down. In response, the guests run to the cave to destroy the glowing rock with a grenade Patrick is carrying. Suddenly, Melanie stabs Patrick and takes Sloane hostage, revealing that it is her true fantasy. She orchestrated their arrival to seek revenge on them for Nick's death, with whom she had a date and was convinced was her soulmate. Julia is revealed to be Roarke's wife, brought back by the power of the island dying of a terminal disease she was suffering from when she met Roarke, and convinces him to help the guests before disappearing.\nSloane remembers the spring water she collected before and wishes Melanie \"to be\" forever with Nick. As a result, a zombified Nick attacks Melanie and drags her into the water. Before drowning, Melanie detonates the grenade, but Patrick sacrifices himself and falls on it to protect the others. As the fantasy concludes, Gwen, Sloane, and Brax wake up at the resort, where Roarke agrees to let them go. While the guests board a plane to leave the now-purified Fantasy Island, Brax wishes for J. D. to come back to life but Roarke explains Brax must stay on the island for his fantasy to come true. After Gwen, Sloane, and a resurrected J. D. depart, Roarke asks Brax to become his new assistant. Remembering a nickname J. D. gave him, Brax chooses to rename himself \"Tattoo\", initiating the events of the 1977 television series.\n\nCast[edit]\nMain[edit]\n\nMichael Pe\u00f1a as Mr. Roarke\nMaggie Q as Gwen Olsen\nLucy Hale as Melanie Cole\nAustin Stowell as Patrick Sullivan\nJimmy O.

The site's critics consensus read: \"Fantasy Island tries to show audiences the dark side of wish fulfillment, but mainly serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of exhuming long-dead franchises.\"[20] On Metacritic, the film had a score of 22 out of 100 based on 29 critic reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[21] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[22]\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \"inane\" and \"contrived,\" and wrote that \"it feels like someone planted about a half-dozen different scripts all over this Fantasy Island.\"[23] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film zero out of five stars, writing, \"If crimes against cinema merited prosecution, Blumhouse's Fantasy Island would go directly to death row...The only genuine, blood-curdling scream incited by this stupefyingly dull time- and money-waster comes at the end, when the notion dawns that [the film] is meant to spawn sequels. Stop it now, before it kills again.\"[24] Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com wrote that the film \"contains less raw terror in its entirety than Sonic the Hedgehog during any five minutes of its running time,\" calling it \"utterly boring\" and \"no sane person's fantasy of a half-decent movie.\"[25] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 2/5 stars, describing it as \"an odd attempt at genre-surfing that ends up well out of its depth\".[26]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\n\n2021\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards[27][28][29]\n\nWorst Picture\n\nJason Blum, Marc Toberoff and Jeff Wadlow\n\nNominated\n\n\nWorst Supporting Actress\n\nLucy Hale\n\nNominated\n\n\nMaggie Q\n\nNominated\n\n\nWorst Screenplay\n\nJeff Wadlow & Chris Roach & Jillian Jacobs;  Based on the television series created by Gene Levitt\n\nNominated\n\n\nWorst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel\n\nFantasy Island\n\nNominated\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Fantasy Island (2020)\".
