The plot centers on a 22-year-old college graduate (Raiff) who starts making money as a party starter while he also strikes up a relationship with a 32-year-old mother (played by Dakota Johnson, who also produced the film). The cast also includes Ra\u00fal Castillo, Odeya Rush, Evan Assante, Vanessa Burghardt, Brad Garrett, and Leslie Mann.\nIt premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2022,[2] and was released in limited theaters and streaming on Apple TV+ on June 17, 2022. The film received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTwelve-year-old New Jersey resident Andrew asks a party host out on a date; she rejects him due to their age difference. Ten years later, Andrew's girlfriend, Maya, moves to Barcelona to finish her Fulbright. Andrew is asked to take his twelve-year-old brother David to a bat mitzvah, where Andrew encourages the kids to dance. He meets Domino and her autistic daughter, Lola. Andrew's peers have been spreading rumors about Domino. Andrew introduces himself and manages to take Lola to the dance floor, surprising Domino. The mothers at the party take notice of his charisma and agree to hire Andrew as a party starter at upcoming bar and bat mitzvahs. He dubs himself the Jig Conductor and plans to use the money to reunite with Maya in Barcelona.\nAndrew is removed as DJ from his next party for confronting a child who bullied Lola. He finds Domino in the restroom, covered in blood. He and Lola find her a change of clothes; Andrew drives them home. Domino tells Andrew she has a fianc\u00e9, Joseph, working in Chicago. She reveals the blood was not from her period but caused by a recent miscarriage. Domino hires Andrew as Lola's sitter. They kiss. Andrew later has sex with his friend, Macy. Andrew spends the next day talking to David and interviewing for a job as an intern. Andrew meets Joseph at a party and later spends time with Domino and Lola. Andrew starts to think Maya is dating someone in Barcelona; his mother comforts him. Andrew helps Lola go to sleep by scratching her back, an activity she had previously only allowed Domino to do. Andrew sees Domino and Joseph in a bad mood before he leaves.\nAndrew gets the intern job. He and Domino talk about her engagement with Joseph and they kiss. Back home, Andrew and David have an argument. Joseph fires Andrew from his job as Lola's sitter. David almost experiences his first kiss but leaves to stop some kids bullying Lola. A fight between Andrew's family and the other guests at the bar mitzvah ensues. Andrew tells Domino he loves her. She rejects his advances, telling him that she is in love with Joseph, even when it does not appear she is. Joseph thanks Andrew for taking care of his family. Andrew decides he does not want to go to Barcelona. Instead, he plans to move out. Andrew and Domino say goodbye. She encourages him to live his life to the fullest before making any commitments. David tells Andrew he had his first kiss at school. Six months later, Domino and Joseph are married, while Andrew has fun dancing at a bar with his friends.\n\nCast[edit]\nCooper Raiff as Andrew, a Tulane University graduate who has recently moved back home\nJavien Mercado as twelve-year-old Andrew\nDakota Johnson as Domino\nEvan Assante as David, Andrew's younger brother\nVanessa Burghardt as Lola, Domino's daughter\nLeslie Mann as Lisa, Andrew's mother\nBrad Garrett as Stepdad Greg\nRa\u00fal Castillo as Joseph, Domino's fianc\u00e9\nColton Osorio as Rodrigo, David's friend\nAmara Pedroso Saquel as Maya, Andrew's girlfriend\nOdeya Rush as Macy, Andrew's friend from high school\nBrooklyn Sloane Ramirez as Margaret\nKelly O'Sullivan as Bella\nShane Stadtlander as Nicky The Bar Mitzvah Boy\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was announced in March 2021, with Dakota Johnson and Cooper Raiff set to star.[3] In August, Leslie Mann, Brad Garrett, Ra\u00fal Castillo, Odeya Rush, Vanessa Burghardt, Evan Assante and Colton Osorio joined the cast.[4] Principal photography began on August 12, 2021, with filming taking place in Pittsburgh.[5][6][7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2022.
