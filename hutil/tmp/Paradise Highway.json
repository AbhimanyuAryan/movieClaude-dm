        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 14% of 21 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"No need to fasten your seatbelts; alleged thriller Paradise Highway leads a talented ensemble through a predictable, seat-numbing ride.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Joe Leydon of Variety called the film \"A shrewdly constructed melodrama that does not transcend cliches and conventions so much as show how useful and effective they can be in the right hands\". Robert Daniels of RogerEbert.com wrote: \"Paradise Highway is the kind wayward, tonally muddled project an actress the caliber of Binoche would only sign onto if promises were broken and payback was required\". The New York Times's Concepci\u00f3n de Le\u00f3n had this to say about Paradise Highway: \"Though it is refreshing to see members of law enforcement focused on recovering and supporting a victim rather than pursuing her abusers, it does not allow for much narrative tension\".",
        "Paradise Highway was released direct-to-video and streaming services in North America, but did earn $222,607 at the box office in other territories."
