(March 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nTo save the life of her brother, truck driver Sally reluctantly agrees to smuggle illicit cargo, a girl named Leila. As they begin a danger-fraught journey across state lines, a dogged FBI operative sets out on their trail, determined to do whatever it takes to terminate a human-trafficking operation and bring Sally and Leila to safety.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJuliette Binoche as Sally\nFrank Grillo as Dennis\nHala Finley as Leila\nCameron Monaghan as FBI Special Agent Finley Sterling\nVeronica Ferres as Rose\nChristiane Seidel as Claire\nMorgan Freeman as Gerick\nConnor Adkins as Random gay kid\nAngel Gwin as Green Jersey girl\nProduction[edit]\nThe film is an international co-production between the United States, Germany, and Switzerland,[1] produced by Grindstone Entertainment Group and Silver Reel; they confirmed the lead cast of Juliette Binoche, Frank Grillo and Morgan Freeman in July 2021.[2]\nFilming occurred in Jackson and Clarksdale, Mississippi, in July 2021.[3] Filming also took place in Brookhaven, Mississippi.[4]\nAs of August 2021, the film was in post-production.[5] In October 2021, it was announced that Lionsgate acquired North American distribution rights to the film.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released in theaters and on-demand in the United States by Lionsgate on July 29, 2022.[7][8] The film was also shown at the Locarno Festival in August 2022.[9]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 14% of 21 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"No need to fasten your seatbelts; alleged thriller Paradise Highway leads a talented ensemble through a predictable, seat-numbing ride.\"[10] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[11]\nJoe Leydon of Variety called the film \"A shrewdly constructed melodrama that does not transcend cliches and conventions so much as show how useful and effective they can be in the right hands\".[12] Robert Daniels of RogerEbert.com wrote: \"Paradise Highway is the kind wayward, tonally muddled project an actress the caliber of Binoche would only sign onto if promises were broken and payback was required\".[13] The New York Times's Concepci\u00f3n de Le\u00f3n had this to say about Paradise Highway: \"Though it is refreshing to see members of law enforcement focused on recovering and supporting a victim rather than pursuing her abusers, it does not allow for much narrative tension\".[14]\n\nBox office[edit]\nParadise Highway was released direct-to-video and streaming services in North America, but did earn $222,607 at the box office in other territories.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Goodfellow, Melanie (July 6, 2022). \"Brad Pitt-Starrer 'Bullet Train' To Kick-Off Switzerland's Locarno Film Festival, Lakeside Festival Unveils 75th Edition Selections, Juries\".
