After the birth of Ruby, Jo's successful world begins to fall apart as she suffers postpartum depression. Jo begins to behave aggressively and doubtfully, although she receives support from Shelly (Meredith Hagner), a neighbor who claims to be a mother even though she refuses to show her supposed baby to others. Jo becomes suspicious of the intentions of Shelly and everyone around her as she tries to protect her baby, who is also seen by Jo as someone hostile."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 45 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A flawed but finely cut gem, Baby Ruby puts the horror of new parenthood under a frighteningly effective magnifying glass.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "In a review for San Francisco Chronicle, Bob Strauss wrote: \"Playwright Bess Wohl\u2019s feature-directing debut is a sly, mutant meld of horror thriller, feminist satire and subjective, postpartum paranoia study. It\u2019s serious about how the demands of baby care can overwhelm, and skeptical of societal pressures on women to not just accept but love motherhood\u2019s burdens.\""
