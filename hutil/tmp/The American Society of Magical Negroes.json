It was written and directed by Kobi Libii in his directorial debut, and stars David Alan Grier and An-Li Bogan.\nIt premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024, and Focus Features released it in theaters in the United States on March 15, 2024. It received mixed reviews from critics,[3] who noted that while it presented an intriguing concept, it fell short of thoroughly exploring its most challenging notions.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAren, a young biracial African-American man, displays his yarn sculpture at an art gallery, facing rejection; no one buys his work. Advised by the white gallery owner to approach a specific patron, Aren is mistaken for a waiter and handed an empty glass. At the bar, African-American bartender Roger empathizes with Aren's experience.\nDiscouraged, Aren discards his sculpture and heads home. On the way, he encounters a drunk white woman struggling with an ATM. She asks him for help, but he's falsely accused of theft, leading to a physical confrontation with two white men. Roger intervenes, deftly defusing the situation with a barbecue-restaurant recommendation and prompting one of the men to say, \"No hard feelings, okay?\"\nRoger introduces Aren to The American Society of Magical Negroes, a group aiming to safeguard African Americans by appeasing white individuals. Aren witnesses historical acts of reassurance by Black men towards whites, embodying the Society's mission. Under Roger's mentorship, Aren helps a shy white police officer gain confidence at a dance club.\nA chance encounter with Lizzie, a woman with a multiethnic background, at a coffee shop leads Aren to develop feelings for her, even as he's called away for Society duties. The society arranges a job for him at Meetbox, a social media platform, where he's assigned to reassure Jason, a depressed white colleague. Aren discovers that they report to Lizzie, who also works there.\nAmidst his growing friendship with Lizzie, Aren learns of Meetbox's racial recognition flaws, and the company's superficial response highlights systemic issues. Noting Aren's feelings for Lizzie\u2014whom Jason also likes\u2014Roger tells Aren he must focus on boosting Jason's career and love life, sacrificing his own happiness.\nMeetbox prepares a global broadcast to its staff to outline its new diversity-embracing policies. Jason is appointed a co-presenter, and invites Aren to join him. However, as the presentation begins, Aren learns that he was invited so the company would appear more diversity-conscious. He interrupts the live presentation, challenging the company's woke fa\u00e7ade, and asserting that he has the right to belong to society without apology or special treatment. His defiance shocks his colleagues and disrupts the Society's magic. He is transported back to Society headquarters, where its president, DeDe, tells him he is to be expelled and his memory of them erased.\nDespite Roger's attempt to erase Aren's memories, the magic weakens, signaling a broader rebellion within the Society against their subservient roles.\nAren reunites with Lizzie in Los Angeles, where they reconcile and happily walk off together\u2014while Lizzie, apparently joking, tells him she belongs to a magical society of her own. In a coda, we see her enter a hair salon and access a secret entrance to the Society of Supportive Wives and Girlfriends (SOSWAG).\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJustice Smith as Aren\nDavid Alan Grier as Roger\nAn-Li Bogan as Lizzie\nDrew Tarver as Jason\nMichaela Watkins as Masterson\nAisha Hinds as Gabbard\nTim Baltz as Officer Miller\nRupert Friend as Mick\nNicole Byer as DeDe\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe American Society of Magical Negroes is a satire of the Magical Negro trope.[5][6] It was developed by Kobi Libii as part of the Sundance's Screenwriters and Directors Lab.[7] In March 2021, SFFILM confirmed that the film was awarded the 2021 Dolby Institute Fellowships, earning industry guidance and a cash grant enabling them to work with a sound designer at the screenwriting stage.[6]\n\nTheatrical release[edit]\nThe film premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024.[8][9] Focus Features released it in theaters in the United States and Canada on March 15, 2024.[5] It was released alongside Arthur the King and the wide expansion of Love Lies Bleeding, and was projected to gross around $3 million from 1,146 theaters in its opening weekend.[10] It made $520,000 on its first day and went on to debut to $1.3 million, finishing ninth at the box office.[11] The demographic breakdown of the opening-weekend audience was 50% male, 75% aged 25 years and older, and 52% African American, 31% Caucasian, 10% Hispanic, and 4% Asian.[12] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film a 70% overall positive score, with 51% saying they would definitely recommend it.[11]\nUniversal Pictures will release the film in theaters in other territories, starting with the United Kingdom on April 26, 2024.[1]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nFilm review website Metacritic surveyed 20 critics and assessed 13 reviews as mixed, 5 as positive, and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 52 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[3] Website Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative, surveyed 64 critics and assessed 46 reviews as negative and 18 as positive, for a 28% approval rating. The average rating calculated was 5.1 out of 10. It summarized the critical consensus: \"[It] has a promising premise, but is too timid to fully engage with its most provocative ideas.\"[4]\nThe Washington Post's Michael O'Sullivan critiqued the film as a satire with a novel concept that ultimately fell short, turning a potentially sharp commentary on racial tropes into a mix of superhero and romantic comedy elements that lacked depth and failed to challenge audiences. He said that despite its creative premise, its execution was overly cautious and pandering, and that it missed the opportunity to make a more impactful statement on race and representation in cinema.[13]\nEntertainment Weekly's Devan Coggan expressed disappointment with the film, noting that while it introduced a compelling concept that challenged a long-standing cinematic stereotype, it ultimately struggled to maintain momentum, getting lost in a conventional romantic comedy subplot that diluted its satirical potential. She felt that by failing to deeply explore its own themes, or to fully develop its magical society's world, it neither satisfied as a critique of racial representation nor as a romantic comedy, leaving much of its promise unfulfilled.[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"The American Society Of Magical Negroes (12A)\".
