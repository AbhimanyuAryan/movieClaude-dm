    "Plot": [
        "After fourteen years of forced labor in a gulag for the dishonor inflicted on his country in his previous adventure, Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev is released by his country's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, with a mission to deliver Kazakh Minister of Culture (and Kazakhstan's most famous porn actor) Johnny the Monkey to President Donald Trump in an attempt to redeem the nation. Unable to get close to Trump after defecating in the landscaping of Trump International Hotel and Tower in the previous film, Borat opts to give the monkey to Vice President Mike Pence. Before leaving, he discovers that his arch nemesis neighbor, Nursultan Tulyakbay, has stolen his family and home, and that he has a fifteen-year-old daughter, Tutar, who lives in his barn.",
        "Borat is transported across the world in a circuitous route by cargo ship and arrives in Galveston, Texas, where he finds he is a celebrity. Wanting to maintain a low profile, Borat purchases multiple disguises. He buys a cell phone and goes to welcome Johnny, but finds that Tutar is in Johnny's shipping crate and has eaten him. Horrified, Borat faxes Nazarbayev, who tells him to find a way to satisfy Pence or he will be executed. Borat decides to give Tutar to Pence.",
        "Tutar receives a makeover and Borat introduces her at a debutante ball. At the ball, her menstrual blood is prominently displayed during a father and daughter dance. Discovering that Pence is nearby at CPAC, Borat disguises himself as Trump and attempts to give Tutar to him there, but is ejected by security. Nazarbayev is enraged and tells him to return to Kazakhstan for execution. Realizing that he can still give Tutar to someone close to Trump, Tutar suggests giving her to Rudy Giuliani.",
        "Because Giuliani had bragged about having an affair with a large-breasted woman, Borat brings Tutar to a cosmetic surgeon who advises breast implants. While Borat works in a barbershop to raise enough money to pay for breast surgery, he briefly leaves Tutar with a babysitter who is confused by Borat's sexist teachings. She informs Tutar that the things her culture has taught her are lies. After Tutar sees a woman driving a car, and successfully masturbates for the first time, she decides not to get the surgery and lashes out at Borat for keeping her oppressed her whole life. Before leaving, she tells him the Holocaust, their country\u2019s \"greatest accomplishment\" is a lie by citing a Holocaust denial Facebook page.",
        "Shaken, Borat decides to commit suicide by going to the nearest synagogue dressed as his version of a stereotypical Jew and waiting for the next mass shooting, but is shocked to find Holocaust survivors there who treat him with kindness, and to his anti-Semitic delight, reassure him that the Holocaust happened. Overjoyed, Borat goes looking for Tutar, but finds the streets deserted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He quarantines with two QAnon conspiracy theorists who offer to help him reunite with Tutar. They find Tutar online, who has become a reporter and will be covering a March for Our Rights rally in Olympia, Washington.",
        "At the rally, the men appeal to Tutar, telling her that her dad will be killed unless she helps. She accepts and arranges an interview to seduce Giuliani, but without her father's participation. Borat talks with her babysitter and has a change of heart, realizing that he loves Tutar. After the interview, Giuliani and Tutar proceed to a bedroom before Borat intervenes and tries to personally offer sexual favors to Giuliani. Borat decides to face execution in Kazakhstan and Tutar promises to go with him.",
        "Borat is shocked to find he will not be executed as he had instead been used as retaliation by Nazarbayev for making Kazakhstan a laughingstock. Before departing for the United States, Kazakhstan officials infected Borat with SARS-CoV-2 via an injection of \"gypsy tears\", making him patient zero of the COVID-19 pandemic. As he was sent around the world, he continued to spread the virus. Borat uses a recording made near the beginning of his trip to convince Nazarbayev that his admission has been recorded and sent to Brian, the man who sold Borat his phone, and whom Borat claims is America's Minister of Technology.",
        "Borat and Tutar blackmail Nazarbayev into giving him his job back and changing Kazakhstan's misogynistic laws. Three months later, Tutar and Borat are a reporting team and Kazakhstan has a new tradition to replace the nation's antisemitic ones: the Running of the American. It features exaggerated caricatures of Trump supporters and \"Karens\" pretending to spread COVID-19 and killing an effigy of Anthony Fauci. The film ends with a message encouraging viewers to vote in the then-upcoming presidential election."

    "Production": [
        "Rupert Murdoch announced in early February 2007 that Baron\u00a0Cohen had signed on to do another Borat film with 20th Century Fox, distributor of the first film. Baron\u00a0Cohen later claimed that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection as he did in the film and on Da Ali\u00a0G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea. In 2014, he brought back Borat for the FXX series Ali\u00a0G: Rezurection, a compilation of the sketches from Da Ali\u00a0G Show with new footage. He also briefly appeared as Borat in December\u00a02015 on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! to promote the film Grimsby and again in November\u00a02018 to encourage Americans to vote in that year's midterm elections. In the two years leading up to the release, the film's star became more concerned about being politically active, giving speeches and interviews in-person to combat racism; he insisted on releasing the film immediately before the 2020 presidential election to provoke alarm among Americans about a slide into illiberal democracy.",
        "Like several of Sacha Baron\u00a0Cohen's films, the score is composed by his brother Erran Baron\u00a0Cohen, in addition to other original recordings by Romanian Balkan band Fanfare Cioc\u0103rlia and their version of \"Just the Two of Us\"; Canadian roots musician Adrian Raso performing \"Urn St.\u00a0Tavern\".",
        "Filming did not begin until Tutar was cast; Bakalova was chosen for the role among 600 actresses who auditioned. She initially sent in a tape of her acting for an unnamed Hollywood movie she suspected may have been a human trafficking scam, but she ended up going to London to rehearse with Baron\u00a0Cohen, convincing her that this was a real opportunity. Ken Davitian, who portrayed Azamat Bagatov in the first Borat, was offered the opportunity to reprise his role, but did not sign on because the producers would not tell him that the film was a Borat sequel. An early prank filmed in late 2019 involved a farcical interview with Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, followed by a trip to an Arlington, Texas driving range; the scenes were cut from the film but appear in the trailer. In February\u00a02020, Baron\u00a0Cohen was spotted dressed up as Donald Trump, interrupting the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), although his true identity was not revealed at the time.",
        "That same month, Baron\u00a0Cohen traveled to Macon, Georgia, to trick attendees of a fake debutante ball, telling the organizers at the Johnston\u2013Felton\u2013Hay House that he was filming a coming-of-age story. He was briefly pulled over by a police officer for having Bakalova riding on the roof of his vehicle; body cam footage clearly shows he was identified as himself the comedian, as opposed to his character. The crew also attended Marietta-based Temple Kol Emeth to film the scenes with Evans. The production made at least two visits to upstate South Carolina to film at a bakery, crisis pregnancy center, and Halloween supply store. On June 27, 2020, Cohen performed pranks at a gun rally in Olympia, Washington, leading attendees to sing along with racist lyrics to an original song, and interviewed members of the crowd. When demonstrators picketing the rally recognized Baron\u00a0Cohen and began laughing, the crowd and organizers realized they were being pranked and quickly turned violent, but were slowed from storming the stage as security had been hired by the Borat team. Eventually, Baron\u00a0Cohen and his crew were forced to flee in a private ambulance, with Baron\u00a0Cohen having to physically hold the door shut as members of the crowd tried to break in. News media quickly learned about the prank but speculated it was for a new season of Who Is America?",
        "The following month, he was spotted in Los Angeles dressed as Borat and filming, leading to speculation from the public that Baron\u00a0Cohen's next project was a Borat sequel. On two days of filming Baron\u00a0Cohen was required to wear a bulletproof vest due to the possible threats of the scene.",
        "In early September\u00a02020, rumors began to circulate claiming that the film was completely shot, assembled, and screened for film industry executives; the title was originally leaked as Borat\u00a02: Great Success and then Borat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan, where the latter was used as one of the title cards. On September\u00a020, a prank involving Bakalova infiltrating the White House and being interviewed by Chanel Rion of One America News Network was filmed but cut from the final release. The village sequences set in Kazakhstan were shot in Romania (specifically the commune of Valea Albe\u0219tiului in Albe\u0219ti, Mure\u0219 County), but not the same village as the previous film after negative feedback from the villagers. Romanian actors were hired for a few parts.",
        "The film was shot on 72 different cameras, including both high-end cinema cameras and smartphones. The production utilized simple codecs to mimic the look of the original movie. The Arri Amira and Alexa Mini were the A, B, and C cameras, accompanied by lesser cameras for hidden, robotic, and low profile applications, including iPhones. Titmouse, Inc. produced animation services."

    "Release": [
        "In September\u00a02020, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film for $80 million, and scheduled it for an October\u00a023 release. The film was originally going to be released theatrically by Universal Pictures after a negative pickup deal between Universal and Baron Cohen. Since Baron Cohen wanted the film to be seen by the widest audience possible before the elections and Universal was at odds with theater chains over its release of Trolls World Tour in PVOD, while theatrical box office was showing weak numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a PVOD release would required a separate transaction between Universal and Baron Cohen, Baron Cohen and Universal agreed to look for potential buyers for the film in streaming services. Baron\u00a0Cohen presented the movie to several streamers who were not willing to release it due to its political content. With the deal with Amazon Studios, Universal was repaid by its outlay and Baron Cohen was compensated in a manner he would have had Universal released the film theatrically. The first trailer was released on October 1, 2020, confirming that several of Baron\u00a0Cohen's pranks were shot for this film.",
        "In the two weeks leading up to the film release, Amazon spent $20.4\u00a0million on marketing.",
        "Baron\u00a0Cohen joined social media outlets Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter in-character as Borat to comment on American politics in the run-up to the election and promote the film release, including congratulating Donald Trump for winning the first of the 2020 United States presidential debates before the event began and starting a \"feud\" with Ariana Grande for stealing a cut-out of Borat installed at a drive-in theater. The social media push also involved a Twitch stream playing video games with DrLupo and meeting YouTube influencers. He also made a return to Jimmy Kimmel Live! in character a few days before the film's release.",
        "Amazon Prime UK promoted the film by projecting an image of Borat in an extremely small mankini resembling a face mask on the side of several historic sites in Scotland. In Australia's Bondi Beach, 40\u00a0Borat look-alikes descended onto the sands to do a yoga class in the \"maskini\" gear, accompanied by a large statue. During the second presidential debate, Baron\u00a0Cohen hosted a watch party to debut the film in-character, followed by an afterparty made up of dance music and questions from fans via a live chat. A further stunt involved a large inflatable Borat floating in a barge along the Toronto waterfront and in front of London's Palace of Westminster. The Cerne Abbas Giant was also defaced with a mask and the slogan \"WEAR MASK. SAVE LIVE\".",
        "Amazon additionally collaborated with YouTube pranksters to trick Stephen Bear, Jimmy Carr, Perrie Edwards, David Spade, David Walliams, and Ann Widdecombe into a false audition for a third Borat film, convincing them to act as a Kazakhstani ambassador. The company also modified their Alexa service to give potato news from Borat."

    "Reception": [
        "Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 306 critics positively reviewed the film, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm proves Sacha Baron\u00a0Cohen's comedic creation remains a sharp tool for exposing the most misguided\u2014or outright repugnant\u2014corners of American culture.\" Most publications said the film received generally positive reviews, though the BBC and Reuters summed up the critical consensus as \"mixed\".",
        "Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an A\u2212 and wrote: \"Fourteen years after his last romp, Borat isn't exactly woke, but his time has come: This searing brand of humor has never felt more essential. Blending activism with entertainment, Baron\u00a0Cohen's best movie to date gives us new reasons to be afraid of the world, but also permission to laugh at it.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: \"Fourteen years after Kazakhstan journalist Borat came to America to make a documentary about our great nation, he's back in the USA\u2014older, dumber, far more famous and arguably even more politically incorrect and offensively funny than he was in 2006.\"",
        "In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"there are still some real laughs and pointed political moments\" but that it \"overstays its welcome\". Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club gave the film a B\u2212 and called it \"frequently funny and occasionally pointed\" but \"also another instance where doing things as they've always been done no longer feels like quite enough\". Similarly, Devika Girish of The New York Times notes how the sequel is not as shocking or insightful as the first film, summing up, \"[the] elaborate ruses of Borat Subsequent Moviefilm left me neither entertained nor enraged, but simply resigned\".",
        "In a review for The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin awarded the film two of five stars, calling the film \"despairingly threadbare\" and \"a string of half-formed, recycled and disjointed pranks you suspect wouldn't have survived the quality-control process on the original, effortfully connected post hoc by largely uninspired scripted scenes.\" Longtime Chicago Tribune film columnist Michael Philips gave the film two stars, calling the sequel \"ruder\" and \"more sentimental\" than its predecessor. Phillips summarized his reaction as having \"laughed at a good deal of the movie, but a good deal more of it left [him] with (Cohen's  [sic] intention, probably) the taste of ashes in the mouth\". Alonso Duralde of The Wrap negatively reviewed the movie, believing it \"valiantly fails to resuscitate the satire corpse\". Duralde, a self-avowed \"superfan\" of the first film, writes that \"the sequel might (in, one hopes, a happier future) be hilarious in retrospect, but at the moment, it's a mostly cringe-worthy experience\".",
        "Unlike the reception of the first Borat movie, which was denounced by the Kazakh state as a libellous smear against the people of Kazakhstan, and resulted in threatened legal action against Cohen and his distributors, the release of the sequel received a more mixed reception. The Kazakh American Association denounced the film for promoting racism, cultural appropriation and xenophobia. On the other hand, the tourism board of Kazakhstan has appropriated a key catchphrase, \"very nice\", to promote the advantages of visiting Kazakhstan, capitalizing on the increased public interest in Kazakhstan as a result of the first film."
