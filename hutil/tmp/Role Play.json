In July 2021, it was announced that Kaley Cuoco was in negotiations to star in the film, as well as produce alongside Heineman and Rona. In October 2021, it was reported that Thomas Vincent would direct the film, and Cuoco's roles as actor and producer were also confirmed; Cuoco would be producing though under her banner Yes, Norman Productions.",
        "In June 2022, it was announced that David Oyelowo was cast as Cuoco's character's husband, and Billy Bob Thornton was cast as a \"mysterious stranger who encounters the couple\". In July 2022, it was announced that Bill Nighy had replaced Thornton, who had to leave the film due to a scheduling conflict. Connie Nielsen was also cast.",

        "Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote: \"Luckily, Role Play is handled lightly enough by Vincent's direction and Seth Owen's script that we never feel the need to take it very seriously. Which is fortunate, because otherwise we'd have to ponder why we\u2019re rooting for an amorally ruthless hitwoman anyway\"."
