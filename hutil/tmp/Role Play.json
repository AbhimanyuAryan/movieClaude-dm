This game takes a dramatic turn when Emma\u2019s two worlds collide, causing chaos and forcing her to flee to Europe.

Which is fortunate, because otherwise we'd have to ponder why we\u2019re rooting for an amorally ruthless hitwoman anyway\".[3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Tinoco, Armando (November 16, 2023). \"'Role Play' Trailer: First Look At Kaley Cuoco & David Oyelowo In Prime Video's Comedic Spy Thriller\".
