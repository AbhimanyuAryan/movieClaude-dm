He collects usable parts which he salvages, repairs, and sells to a thrift shop owned by his acquaintance. Clean lives alone in a workshop following the death of his daughter. \nWhile picking up trash in the evening near a seafood restaurant owned by a man named Michael, Clean notices Michael and his armed goons in the middle of a drug trafficking deal.\nThe next morning, Clean learns that his neighbor Dianda\u2019s school bus no longer operates in her area due to service cuts, and offers to drive her to school. Afterwards, he drops off a bike at her house that he refurbished. Dianda\u2019s grandmother, Ethel, questions his motives; he says that he is \"just trying to save myself.\" \nUpon realizing his suppliers have shorted him five bags of cocaine, Michael beats one of his partners to death. His son, Mikey, witnesses this in horror. That evening, Clean discovers the remains of Michael\u2019s partner while cleaning. Michael suddenly appears, apologizes for the stench, and offers him money, but Clean refuses and continues doing his job.\nThe next day, Clean\u2019s car breaks down in a bad neighborhood. While he tries to fix it, a group of thugs chase a man past Clean into an alley. Clean follows them, and one of them knocks him out with a baseball bat. Clean wakes up in a hospital and is prescribed medication by a doctor, but he refuses and goes straight home.\nThe next day, Clean sees Dianda with some thugs. He urges her go home, but Dianda replies that he has no right to order her around. When the thugs get confrontational, Dianda finally complies with Clean\u2019s request to avoid further conflict. \nAt home, Michael angrily confronts Mikey for hanging out with his friends instead of helping him run his business. Mikey threatens him with a knife and decides to run away from home.\nClean works to clean up an abandoned house and later finds Dianda being bullied and on the verge of being raped by the thugs, among them Mikey, who are recording the encounter. Clean beats them with a pipe wrench and takes Dianda home.\nThe next morning, Michael is told that Mikey needs surgery or he may never speak properly again, but Michael refuses to pay for it. After watching the recording from the prior night, Michael orders Frank, a corrupt police officer, to kill Dianda and Ethel and bring Clean to him alive.\nClean attempts to leave the city with Dianda and Ethel, but notices that he\u2019s being followed. While being pulled over, he recognizes the police officer as one who has been bribed by Michael. He speeds off but his car starts breaking down, though he manages to evade the police. They stop at a diner. Dianda escorts Ethel to the restroom while Clean searches for a vehicle to hijack. Michael\u2019s henchmen arrive and chase Dianda and Ethel to the back rooms of the building. Clean intercepts them and kills each one.\nAfter stopping at a motel for the night, Ethel blames Clean for endangering them and displacing them from their home. Clean vows to make things right and returns home to buy weapons.\nAt Michael\u2019s residence, Frank learns from a fellow officer that Clean was once a feared professional assassin known as \u201cThe Grim Reaper\u201d, who quit and secluded himself in the city after his daughter died. Clean calls Michael, warning him that he is coming for him.\nClean crashes the garbage truck into Michael\u2019s home and gets into a shootout with Michael\u2019s men, killing them effortlessly. He is then beaten by Michael, but manages to turn the fight around. He is about to kill Michael when an armed Mikey appears. Michael thinks his son will kill Clean, but Mikey empties the weapon into his father. He then attempts to shoot Clean, but is out of ammo.\nSome time afterwards, crime rates in Dianda\u2019s neighborhood have significantly waned as more kids come out to play in the streets. While pedaling down the street, Dianda notices a garbage truck approaching and smiles.\n\nCast[edit]\nAdrien Brody as Clean\nGlenn Fleshler as Michael\nRichie Merritt as Mikey\nChandler DuPont as Dianda\nMykelti Williamson[4] as Travis\nRZA[4] as Pawn Shop Kurt\nMichelle Wilson as Ethel\nJohn Bianco as Frank\nGerard Cordero as Vic\nCatherine Nastasi as Mikey's Mom\nAlex Corrado as Tommy\nJade Yorker as Dante\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 19, 2021.[4][5]\nOn September 1, 2021, it was announced that IFC Films acquired North American distribution rights to the film.[6][7] It was released in theaters on January 28, 2022.[8] In April 2022, IFC Films signed an output deal with AMC+.
