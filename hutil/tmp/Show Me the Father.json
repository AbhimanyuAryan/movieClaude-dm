        "The Christian Post positively reacted to the film. Writing for Crosswalk.com, Michael Foust said that \"Show Me the Father isn't a boring documentary. Like the Kendricks Brothers' feature films, it inspires and convicts you \u2013 and leaves you reaching for the box of tissue.\" Reviewing for World Radio, Collin Garbario praised the film but suggested the filmmakers could have \"broadened their interviews to include more perspectives on the importance of fathers.  For example, we don't really get to hear about the legacy that a good or bad father can leave on a woman's life.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\", the fourth consecutive top score for a Kendrick Brothers-produced film, while PostTrak reported 88% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it."
