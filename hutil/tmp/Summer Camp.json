        "Principal photography began in North Carolina in April 2023 and wrapped in late May. Filming took place primarily at Camp Pinnacle and Blue Ridge Community College in Hendersonville. Producer Dori Rath researched more than 200 summer camps across the United States out of \"about 14,500 total summer camps\" in the country before choosing Camp Pinnacle.  She told the Asheville Citizen-Times, \"Camp Pinnacle stood head and shoulders above the rest when it came to production value and a rich, cinematic landscape with exceptional activities-based structures, like their Sky Ropes course\". Other filming locations were Wingate University and Nantahala Outdoor Center.  Over 1,000 local extras were hired for the film. The film was in post-production by October 2023."
