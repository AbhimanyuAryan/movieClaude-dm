It stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Josh Peck, Eugene Levy, Beverly D'Angelo, and Dennis Haysbert.\nThe film is scheduled to be released theatrically by Roadside Attractions in the United States on May 31, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nNora, Ginny, and Mary have been close friends since they were children, and have spent their summer vacations together without fail, attending sleepaway camp as a trio. As they have aged, their opportunities to spend time together have dwindled, and thus, when the chance for a summer camp reunion presents itself, they all accept it, albeit with different levels of enthusiasm.[1]\n\nCast[edit]\nDiane Keaton as Nora\nKathy Bates as Ginny\nAlfre Woodard as Mary\nEugene Levy\nBeverly D'Angelo\nDennis Haysbert\nNicole Richie\nJosh Peck\nBetsy Sodaro\nTom Wright\nRay Santiago as Brian[2]\nProduction[edit]\nIn February 2023, Deadline reported that Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard signed on to star in the comedy film, Summer Camp, directed and written by Castille Landon.[1]  The following month, Eugene Levy was added to the cast as the love interest Keaton's character.[3] In April, Beverly D'Angelo, Dennis Haysbert, Nicole Richie, Josh Peck, Betsy Sodaro and Tom Wright were added to the cast.[4]\nPrincipal photography began in North Carolina in April 2023 and wrapped in late May.[5][6] Filming took place primarily at Camp Pinnacle and Blue Ridge Community College in Hendersonville.[5] Producer Dori Rath researched more than 200 summer camps across the United States out of \"about 14,500 total summer camps\" in the country before choosing Camp Pinnacle.  She told the Asheville Citizen-Times, \"Camp Pinnacle stood head and shoulders above the rest when it came to production value and a rich, cinematic landscape with exceptional activities-based structures, like their Sky Ropes course\".[6] Other filming locations were Wingate University and Nantahala Outdoor Center.[6]  Over 1,000 local extras were hired for the film.[5] The film was in post-production by October 2023.[7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn April 2024, Roadside Attractions acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, scheduling it for a theatrical release on May 31, 2024.[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Grobar, Matt (February 28, 2023). \"Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates & Alfre Woodard Set For Castille Landon Comedy Summer Camp\".
