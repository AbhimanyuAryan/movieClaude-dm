Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan co-star. It reunites Farrell and Gleeson after McDonagh's directorial debut In Bruges (2008).[9][10][11]\nThe film had its world premiere on 5 September 2022 at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, where Farrell won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and McDonagh won the Golden Osella for Best Screenplay.[12] It was theatrically released in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States on 21 October 2022 by Searchlight Pictures. The film received largely positive reviews, with particular praise for McDonagh's direction and screenplay, the performances of the cast, and Carter Burwell's score. It grossed $52\u00a0million worldwide against a $20\u00a0million budget.\nThe Banshees of Inisherin received nine nominations at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.[13][14][15] At the 80th Golden Globe Awards, it won three awards: Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, Best Actor \u2013 Musical or Comedy (Farrell), and Best Screenplay.[16] It also won four BAFTA Awards from ten nominations at the 76th British Academy Film Awards: Outstanding British Film, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Keoghan), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Condon), and Best Original Screenplay.[17]\nThe film was also named one of the Top Ten Films of 2022 by the National Board of Review.[18] It has since been cited as among the best films of the 2020s and the 21st century so far.[19][20][21][22]\n\n\nPlot\nIn the spring of 1923, near the end of the Irish Civil War, on the fictional isle of Inisherin (literally \"the island of Ireland\"),[a][23][24] fiddler Colm Doherty abruptly begins ignoring his lifelong best friend and drinking buddy P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in. When a hurt P\u00e1draic presses Colm for an explanation, he says that P\u00e1draic is too dull, and he would rather spend the remainder of his life composing music and doing things for which he will be remembered. P\u00e1draic is devastated and refuses to accept the situation, while Colm only becomes more resistant to his old friend's attempts to make amends, eventually giving P\u00e1draic an ultimatum: every time P\u00e1draic talks to him, Colm will cut off one of his own fingers.\nThe local Garda, Peadar Kearney, beats his troubled son Dominic severely for drinking his alcohol, and P\u00e1draic and his sister Siobh\u00e1n take Dominic in for a night. While delivering milk to the market, P\u00e1draic is insulted by Peadar and retaliates by making public the fact that Peadar abuses his son. Peadar punches him to the ground. Having witnessed this, Colm drives P\u00e1draic home; the two do not speak.\nSiobh\u00e1n and Dominic try to defuse the pair's feud, to no avail. P\u00e1draic drunkenly confronts Colm and berates him for throwing away their friendship, as well as for drinking with Peadar, whom he accuses of molesting Dominic. After Siobh\u00e1n leads P\u00e1draic away, Colm says that this is the most interesting P\u00e1draic has ever been, which Dominic overhears. The next morning, not remembering what he has said, P\u00e1draic attempts to apologise to Colm, but the conversation goes badly. Colm responds by cutting off his left index finger and throwing it at P\u00e1draic's door.\nP\u00e1draic later sees Colm meeting with Declan, a fiddler from the mainland. Jealous, P\u00e1draic tricks Declan into returning home by lying that his father was hit by a bread van. As the tensions worsen, local elder Mrs. McCormick warns P\u00e1draic that death will come to the island soon. Meanwhile, Siobh\u00e1n sympathetically rejects Dominic's romantic advances.\nDominic tells P\u00e1draic what Colm said about him in the pub; encouraged, P\u00e1draic tells Dominic what he did to Declan, but Dominic, disappointed, rejects him as mean and refuses to speak to him anymore. P\u00e1draic gets drunk and starts another confrontation with Colm at Colm's house; Colm says he has finished composing his song (\"The Banshees of Inisherin\") and seems finally open to renewing their friendship, but P\u00e1draic drunkenly reveals what he did to Declan. Instead of meeting P\u00e1draic at the pub, Colm cuts off all four of his remaining left fingers and throws them at Padraic's door.\nFed up by the feud and long bored with life on the island, Siobh\u00e1n moves to the mainland for a job in a library. Devastated, P\u00e1draic comes home to find his pet donkey Jenny has choked to death on one of Colm's fingers. He confronts Colm at the pub; Colm offers a truce, but an embittered P\u00e1draic informs him that he will burn his house down the next day at 2 p.m. At the promised time the next day, P\u00e1draic does so; he looks in a window and sees Colm calmly sitting inside. P\u00e1draic takes Colm's dog Sammy with him to save him from the fire. Peadar watches P\u00e1draic burn down the house, and as he rushes to P\u00e1draic's house to confront him, he encounters Mrs. McCormick, who leads Peadar to Dominic's corpse in the river. After returning home, P\u00e1draic writes a letter to Siobh\u00e1n that glosses over his lonely, friendless life.\nThe next morning, P\u00e1draic takes Sammy back and finds Colm, who survived the fire, standing on the beach beside his burnt-out house. Colm apologises for the donkey's death and suggests destroying the house has ended their feud; P\u00e1draic replies that it would have ended only if Colm had stayed inside. Colm wonders whether the Civil War is coming to an end; P\u00e1draic replies he is sure the fighting will begin again soon because \"some things there's no moving on from\", adding that he thinks that is \"a good thing\" before leaving. Unbeknownst to either, Mrs. McCormick silently watches them from the remains of Colm's house.\n\nCast\nThe film's stars (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson)\nColin Farrell as P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in\nBrendan Gleeson as Colm Doherty\nKerry Condon as Siobh\u00e1n S\u00failleabh\u00e1in\nBarry Keoghan as Dominic Kearney\nGary Lydon as Garda Peadar Kearney\nPat Shortt as publican Jonjo Devine\nSheila Flitton as Mrs. McCormick\nBr\u00edd N\u00ed Neachtain as postmistress Mrs. O'Riordan\nJon Kenny as Gerry\nAaron Monaghan as Declan\nDavid Pearse as priest\nLasairfh\u00edona N\u00ed Chonaola as female singer\nJohn Carty as older musician 1\nProduction\nIn February 2020, it was reported that Martin McDonagh had set his next directorial effort up with Searchlight Pictures, and that it would reunite him with his In Bruges stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.[9][10][11] In August 2021, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan were added to the cast.[25][26]\nPrincipal photography began in August 2021 on Inishmore (Inis M\u00f3r) before moving to Achill Island, County Mayo, later that month.[27] Locations used on Achill include Cloughmore (JJ Devine's Pub), Corrymore Lake (Mrs. McCormick's cottage), Keem Bay (Colm's house), Purteen Harbour (O'Riordan's shop), and St. Thomas's Church in Dugort.[28][29][30] Filming wrapped on 23 October 2021.[31]\nCostume designer Eimer N\u00ed Mhaoldomhnaigh discussed the pains she and her team took to make the wardrobe not feel like \"a pastiche of the Aran Islands\", which included using cloth that was entirely homespun and only using Irish wools, linens, and overdyed fabrics. For P\u00e1draic's red jumper, Mhaoldomhnaigh envisioned what his sister Siobh\u00e1n would have genuinely been motivated to make for him. \"I can imagine Siobh\u00e1n thinking, 'Oh my God, the winter's going to be very cold. I'm going to knit him a jumper,' then making the little collar as a kind of personal touch\u00a0... there's a beautiful naivet\u00e9 to the way he dresses, but it's very tender as well, that idea that she adds this little touch to it. I think it says so much about him and his relationship with Siobh\u00e1n, and his relationship with where he lives and his Irishness,\" N\u00ed Mhaoldomhnaigh explained.[32]\nFor Colm, N\u00ed Mhaoldomhnaigh said: \"There had to be something of the poet in the way he dressed, but without it being very ostentatious. So, he wears some corduroy that's nicely dyed and a saffron-colored linen shirt. There's that element of, not vanity, but a knowingness of somebody who has traveled to the outside world at some point and brought back ideas of what a poet or a musician should look like.\"[32]\n\nMusic\nMain article: The Banshees of Inisherin (soundtrack)\nThe original score is by Carter Burwell, McDonagh's frequent collaborator. McDonagh did not want Burwell to compose an \"Irish-based\" score, despite the film's setting.[33][34][35] For P\u00e1draic's character, Burwell attempted \"child-like\" and \"Disney character\" music; he also used fiddle-themed compositions for Colm.[36] The soundtrack was digitally released by Hollywood Records on 21 October 2022 along with the film.[37]\nThe film also has traditional pub music session scenes with Irish music, in which traditional musicians join Gleeson, who plays the fiddle. The other musicians are John Carty (fiddle), his son James Carty (fiddle), Conor Connolly (accordion), Oliver Farrelly (accordion), and Ryan Owens (bodhr\u00e1n). In one scene, Lasairfh\u00edona N\u00ed Chonaola sings the Irish song \"I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day\".[citation needed]\nThe film's opening scene is set to the traditional Bulgarian folk song \"Polegnala e Todora (Love Song)\", arranged by Filip Kutev and performed by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir.[38][39]\n\nRelease\nColin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Martin McDonagh at the premiere of the film at the 66th BFI London Film Festival\nThe Banshees of Inisherin had its world premiere on 5 September 2022 at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, where it received a 15-minute standing ovation from the audience, the longest of that year's festival.[40][41] It also screened at the 47th Toronto International Film Festival that month and as the opening-night film of the 31st Philadelphia Film Festival on 19 October 2022.[42] It was theatrically released on 21 October 2022.[43]\nThe film was released on rental PVOD and made available to stream on HBO Max on 13 December 2022, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD on 20 December 2022 by 20th Century Home Entertainment and Disney / Buena Vista; bonus features include the featurette \"Creating The Banshees of Inisherin\" and deleted scenes.[44][45][46][47]\nThe Banshees of Inisherin was released on Disney+ as part of the Star content hub in selected regions on 14 December 2022 and 21 December 2022 in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[48] The film was also released on Disney+ Hotstar in India on 14 December 2022.[49] It was made available to stream on Hulu on 4 September 2023.[50]\nThe film returned to U.S. cinemas on 27 January 2023 to celebrate its Academy Award nominations.[51]\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe Banshees of Inisherin grossed $10.6\u00a0million in the U.S. and Canada, and $41.8\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $52.4\u00a0million.[4][5]\nIn the film's opening weekend in the U.S. it made $184,454 from four theaters, for a per-venue average of $46,113, making it the second-highest grossing opener for a Fall 2022 platform release, behind Till.[52] The next weekend the film expanded to 58 theaters, making $535,170.[53] The following weekend it expanded to 895 theaters, making $2.1\u00a0million and finishing seventh at the box office.[54] These moderate results were attributed to the increasing change in audience behavior to the detriment of prestige films in a moviegoing environment altered by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, where moviegoers refused to see and support such titles in favor of franchise and straightforward horror films.[55][56] Upon its return to theaters during the weekend of 27 January 2023, following the Academy Award nomination announcements, it rose 383% domestically.[57]\n\nCritical response\nThe performances of Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan received critical acclaim, with all four receiving Academy Award nominations in their respective categories.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 369 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Featuring some of Martin McDonagh's finest work and a pair of outstanding lead performances, The Banshees of Inisherin is a finely crafted feel-bad treat.\"[58] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 87 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[59]\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars, writing that \"as a study of male loneliness and swallowed anger it is weirdly compelling and often very funny\".[60] Todd McCarthy of Deadline Hollywood wrote that the film is \"a simple and diabolical tale of a friendship's end shot through with bristling humor and sudden moments of startling violence\". He praised Ben Davis's cinematography and Carter Burwell's score.[61] David Ehrlich of IndieWire rated it B+, writing that \"its constant undercurrent of humor affords the story's most pressing questions an appropriately ridiculous context, one that speaks to the absurdities of all existence\". He also called it McDonagh's best work since In Bruges.[62]\nMatthew Creith of Screen Rant wrote that the film's \"demonstration of the metaphorical aspects of civil disobedience and internal protest between a set of individuals is remarkably hilarious\".[63] The New York Times's Kyle Buchanan wrote: \"The film was rapturously received here in Venice, earning a lengthy standing ovation and rave reviews.\"[64] For Variety, Guy Lodge wrote: \"What begins as a doleful, anecdotal narrative becomes something closer to mythic in its rage and resonance: McDonagh has long fixated on the most visceral, vengeful extremes of human behavior, but never has he formed something this sorely heartbroken from that fascination.\"[65]\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \"a ruminative ensemble piece that expertly balances the tragicomic with the macabre, inhabiting territory adjacent to McDonagh's stage work yet also sweepingly cinematic\".[66] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph awarded it 5/5 stars and called it \"an often shoulder-shudderingly funny film, whose comic dialogue is dazzlingly designed and performed\".[67]\nConversely, Mark Feeney, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film an unenthusiastic review, calling it \"a short story trying to be a novel\" and the metaphor for the Irish Civil War \"awfully flat-footed\".[68] Several critics took issue with the film's portrayal of Ireland: Mark O'Connell of Slate criticized the film's characters' portrayal of \"Irishness\", writing: \"It's worth noting, though maybe not surprising, that international critics have failed to take issue with its deployment of the hoariest Irish stereotypes.\"[69] Ed Power of The Telegraph wrote that \"underneath its Quiet Man curlicues, a much better movie strains for freedom\" and was disappointed that McDonagh chose to \"shroud his character study in hackneyed Paddy-isms\".[70] The Spectator's Joy Porter attacked the \"insidious falsehood perpetuated by this film about [her] home country's history of partition and civil war\", summarising it as a \"beautifully staged but dangerously ahistorical and misleading film\".[71] John Waters, however, praised the film in his review for First Things for taking \"the kitschified, cliched landscape of Ireland and [handing] it back to itself, cleansed [...] Most Irish writers and artists simply run away from the tainted iconography, but McDonagh cleans it off and kisses it, redeeming it with a new meaning in which the irony is both present and transcended\".[72]\nThe film has appeared on a number of critics' lists of the best films of 2022, ranking first on several.[73][74][75][76][77]\n\nLegacy\nIn April 2023, Screen Rant ranked The Banshees of Inisherin fourth on \"The 10 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far)\", calling it \"one of the great movies that can break the audience's heart while still making them laugh\".[20] In September 2023, Collider ranked it fourth on its list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far, Ranked\", calling it \"one of the greatest 'breakup' movies ever made\" and adding that \"in a decade where he has already given some great performances, Farrell does his best work ever; P\u00e1draic's idealism fades as he realizes that there's no reward for being nice\".[21] The site also ranked it 14th on its list of \"The 25 Best Movies of the 2020s So Far, Ranked\".[78]\nIndieWire included The Banshees of Inisherin on its list of \"The 48 Saddest Movies\", with Alison Foreman writing: \"Martin McDonagh movies are practically synonymous with tragicomic clashes of philosophy, particularly if they're punctuated by outbursts of over-the-top violence ... Still, riding on the wee legs of little Jenny the miniature donkey, The Banshees of Inisherin pulls far ahead in the race for McDonagh's outright saddest film when two old drinking partners suddenly go their separate ways.\"[79] The site also ranked it 40th on its list of \"The 87 Best Comedies of the 21st Century\", with Christian Zilko writing that it \"resonates because its premise is simply and painfully relatable. Anyone who's ever lost a friend, through their own fault or not, will be able to see themselves in the tale\".[22]\nIn August 2023, JJ Devine's Pub was reassembled with the help of Kilkerrin local and publican Luke Mee, becoming a tourist destination due to the film's familiarity and popularity in the area.[80][81]\n\nAccolades\nMain article: List of accolades received by The Banshees of Inisherin\nNotes\n\n\n^ a b There is an actual island called Inisheer located off the west coast of Ireland.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Ben Davis BSC\".
