    "Plot": [
        "During a New Year's party, Ben Matthias, an astrophysicist developing a camera to detect dark matter, meets ghost tour guide Alyssa and becomes entranced with her belief in the supernatural. Ben marries Alyssa, who later dies in a car crash. Distraught, Ben gives up his career and continues to run her ghost tour. Ben searches famous haunted places looking for signs of his wife, but eventually becomes despondent and depressed after finding no evidence of ghosts. Years later, widowed doctor Gabbie and her son Travis move from New York into Gracey Manor to turn it into a bed and breakfast, only to discover that it is infested with ghosts.",
        "Ben is visited by exorcist priest Father Kent, who hires him to photograph Gracey Manor's ghosts. Incredulous, Ben returns home and is haunted by a ghost of a mariner, forcing him to return to the mansion. Ben learns that Gabbie, Travis and Kent have also fallen victim to hauntings, forcing them to return to the mansion. Ben and Kent recruit Harriet, a psychic, and steal blueprints to the mansion from historian Professor Bruce Davis. The group finds a hidden s\u00e9ance room. Harriet manages to contact the spirit of William Gracey, who writes a message instructing them to talk to the legendary medium Madame Leota. However, before they can continue, an entity forces Harriet out of the house. Bruce arrives and becomes haunted as well.",
        "The group stays at the mansion and proceed to look for Leota. Ben goes into the attic, runs afoul of ghostly bride Constance Hatchaway and finds a locked trunk. Examining the contents, they find a crystal ball which houses Leota, who reveals that William Gracey bought the place and recruited her in an attempt to contact the spirit of his late wife every night for an entire year, resulting in the mansion's ghosts taking up residence. A malevolent spirit later surfaced as it tricked Gracey into committing suicide and trapped Leota inside her crystal ball. Harriet attempts to perform an astral projection for more answers but ends up sending Ben out of his body. He soon meets Gracey's ghost before having an encounter with the malevolent spirit, a ghost of a man dressed in a top hat and cloak whose head disappears from his body and disembodily reappears within a hatbox he carries.",
        "The next morning, Bruce takes Ben to get a sketch artist at the local police station to draw up the ghost, identifying him as Alistair Crump, a wealthy heir who was abused by his overbearing father after his mother's death and eventually expelled from their family home. Upon reaching adulthood after his father died from undisclosed causes, he reacquired their home and threw parties over the years to lure his fellow socialites to their deaths out of revenge for society's shunning against him while developing an obsession with the occult, before he was later assassinated by his much-abused staff. Crump then attempts to deter the group by locking the mansion down, but Ben, Kent and Travis manage to escape. They arrive at Crump Manor, which has become a historical site, and learn from the Mariner, who followed them, that Crump has acquired nine hundred ninety-nine souls and now seeks to gain one more in order to escape the mansion and exact the revenge he promised before his assassination on the living world. Travis finds Crump's hat, which they can use as part of a ritual to banish Crump back to the netherworld from whence he came.",
        "The trio make it back to Gracey Manor where Ben and Kent, who reveals he is actually a conman, rescue Gabbie, Harriet and Bruce, but Crump incinerates his hat. Having been impersonating Travis' late father, Crump plots to exploit the former's grief and make him his final soul. Ben finds Travis and convinces him to let go of his father as they and Gabbie confront Crump in the graveyard. Kent rallies the ghosts to rebel against Crump and side with them. Meanwhile, Bruce delivers the remnants of the hat to Harriet, who starts the banishment ritual. When Crump attempts to get Ben to die willingly to see Alyssa again, he reveals he has made peace with losing her as the ritual is complete and Crump is sent back to the netherworld.",
        "Many ghosts decide to stay at the mansion, now in harmony with Gabbie and Travis. Ben goes back to teaching and, upon leaving his apartment, pets the cat who has been hanging out by his door, discovering its name is Tater Tot, a nod to his wife's love for the food of the same name. The group reunites at the mansion for a Halloween party. Harriet regains confidence in her psychic abilities, Kent becomes an actual priest, Travis is voted to his school's student council, Gabbie becomes the newest member of New Orleans General and Bruce maintains his newfound friendships."

        "In July 2010, it was announced that a reboot adaptation based on The Haunted Mansion was in development for Walt Disney Pictures, with Guillermo del Toro as writer and producer. Del Toro stated the project would not take place in a real-world setting, but in a heightened reality. He revealed that the Hatbox Ghost would be one of the main characters and said the film would be \"scary and fun at the same time, but the scary will be scary.\" In June 2011, Walt Disney World Imagineer Jason Surrell was brought onto the project as a creative consultant. In August 2012, Del Toro submitted the final draft of his script to Walt Disney Studios, intended for a PG-13 rating. By July 2013, Del Toro announced he was no longer the project's director, but remained as co-writer and executive producer. In April 2015, Ryan Gosling was in early negotiations to star, while D.V. DeVincentis was hired to rewrite the script. In September 2016, Brigham Taylor was hired as producer.",
        "In August 2020, it was announced that Katie Dippold signed on to write a new screenplay for the film, after it was decided that Del Toro's script was too scary for family audiences. Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich were hired as producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Walt Disney Pictures and Rideback. By April 2021, Justin Simien entered early-negotiations to direct the film, and was officially confirmed as director by July 2021.",

    "Release": [
        "Haunted Mansion had its world premiere at Disneyland in Anaheim, California on July 15, 2023. Due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, the film's cast members could not attend the premiere. Instead, the park's Disney characters including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Disney villains such as Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and the Evil Queen walked the red carpet. It was released theatrically in the United States on July 28 in 4DX and Dolby Cinema formats. It was previously scheduled for March 10, 2023 and then August 11, 2023.",
        "Before the film's release, \nthe cast appeared on the game show Celebrity Family Feud.",

    "Reception": [
        "Haunted Mansion grossed $67.7\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $49.8 million in other territories, for worldwide gross of $117.5\u00a0million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Talk to Me, and was projected to gross $25\u201330 million from 3,740 theaters in its opening weekend, though a debut of $20\u201325 million had also been considered possible. It made $10 million on its first day, including $3.1 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $24.1 million, finishing in third below Barbie and Oppenheimer, and failing to top the opening weekend of the 2003 film ($24.3 million, unadjusted for inflation). Reasons for the low opening have been cited for competition from Barbie and Oppenheimer, lack of marketing, divided word of mouth, and its Halloween-esque tone. Disney suggested that not having the cast available for promotional appearances (due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike) had a negative impact on the opening weekend. Given its $150 million production budget, Variety opined the opening was \"not a great result for a kid-centric tentpole\", and that the film was \"Halloween-esque\". The film fell 62% in its second weekend to $9.2 million, finishing fifth.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of 254 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Haunted Mansion's talented cast makes the movie a pleasant enough destination, although it's neither scary nor funny enough to wholeheartedly recommend.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend the film.",
        "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, and stated, \"Lakeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson and Jamie Lee Curtis cannot save this laborious story of a creepy old dwelling and the awful Hatbox Ghost\". Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, \"While the visual effects are surprisingly weak for a film of this scale, the script proves far better than anyone might expect, establishing an emotional foundation for what might otherwise be a gimmick-driven haunted house movie.\" Lucas Trevor of The Washington Post wrote, \"It\u2019s too dark for a family film, too weightless and juvenile for grown-ups. In a season notable for high-level action spectacle and important auteur projects, Haunted Mansion is not just confused but inconsequential.\""
