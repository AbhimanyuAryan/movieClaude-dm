It is a remake of the 1989 film of the same name and stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Daniela Melchior, Conor McGregor (in his feature film debut), J. D. Pardo, Arturo Castro and Billy Magnussen.\nRoad House premiered on March 8, 2024, at the opening night of the South by Southwest festival, and was released by Amazon MGM Studios via Prime Video on March 21, 2024. It received mixed  to positive reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTroubled former UFC middleweight fighter Elwood Dalton makes a living scamming fighters on the underground circuit. He is approached by Frankie, the owner of an unruly roadhouse in the Florida Keys community of Glass Key, who offers him a job as head bouncer. Initially hesitant, Dalton takes up the offer after narrowly averting a suicide attempt with a freight train that destroys his car. He takes a bus to Frankie's establishment, called simply The Road House, and befriends Charlie, a teenager who runs a bookstore with her father, Stephen.\nAt the Road House, Dalton fends off a motorcycle gang working for local crime boss Ben Brandt and personally drives the injured thugs to the hospital, where he meets Ellie, a doctor who tends to his injuries. Staying in Frankie's disused houseboat, Dalton mentors the other bouncers and becomes popular with the locals. After an attempt on his life by gang leader Dell, Dalton finds him lying in wait at his houseboat. He throws Dell overboard but is unable to save him from being killed and eaten by a crocodile.\nKnox, a psychotic enforcer, is tasked by Brandt's incarcerated father to hunt down Dalton. After an unexpected date with Ellie, Dalton is confronted at gunpoint by Sheriff, who tells him to leave town. However, Ellie, revealed to be the sheriff's daughter, intervenes. She explains that her father is in league with Brandt, who has inherited his wealthy father's drug empire. Brandt meets Dalton at the Road House and taunts him about his past: In a UFC title fight against a friend, Dalton was overcome with rage and killed his opponent in the ring. Knox arrives with Brandt's men, and an all-out bar fight ensues, leaving Dalton badly beaten.\nFrankie admits that Brandt has been buying up property to build an expensive resort, but she is the lone holdout. Dalton decides to leave town but discovers that Charlie and Stephen are in the hospital after Brandt's men burned down their bookstore. Enraged, Dalton kills one of the thugs responsible and captures a sheriff's deputy making a large delivery of Brandt's illicit cash, framing the deputy for the murder and taking the money. The sheriff soon informs Dalton that Brandt has kidnapped Ellie and will exchange her for the money.\nStealing a bomb-laden motorboat to reach Brandt's catamaran yacht, Dalton finds him with the sheriff, who tells him the kidnapping was a lie to lure Dalton aboard. However, Brandt reveals that he is holding Ellie hostage. Tempers flare as Knox approaches in his boat, but Dalton detonates the motorboat and finds Ellie below deck, attempting to smash a window. Fleeing the sinking yacht, Brandt recaptures Ellie while Dalton commandeers Knox's boat. Catching up to Brandt, Dalton and Ellie leap off as Brandt is launched on top of the Road House.\nClimbing up on a causeway, Knox carjacks a pickup truck and crashes into the Road House, leading to a brutal fistfight with Dalton. When Brandt orders him to kill Dalton, Knox snaps Brandt's neck instead. He prepares to finish off Dalton with a shard of wood, but Dalton gains the upper hand and repeatedly stabs Knox into submission, leaving him for dead. The sheriff arrives, agreeing to cover up for Dalton.\nAs Frankie and Stephen begin to rebuild, Charlie says goodbye to Dalton as he waits for his bus out of town. Stephen discovers Dalton has left them the trunk of cash as the bus pulls away. In a mid-credits scene, Knox has survived and assaults the hospital staff, leaving in his gown.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJake Gyllenhaal as Dalton\nDaniela Melchior as Ellie\nConor McGregor as Knox\nBilly Magnussen as Ben Brandt\nJessica Williams as Frankie\nB.K.

The studio prioritized the film despite Gyllenhaal and Liman's individual commitments to Guy Ritchie's The Covenant and Everest.[6] A search for a new writer began to revise a previous draft by Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry.[7] By August 2022, Sheldon Turner had turned in a rewrite of the script.[8] Ultimately, Bagarozzi and Mondry received final screenplay credit, with story credit given to the duo and the original's story writer David Lee Henry.[9]\n\nCasting[edit]\nThe project was officially greenlit in August 2022 by Amazon Studios,[10] which had purchased MGM five months earlier.[11] Daniela Melchior, Billy Magnussen, Conor McGregor, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Lukas Gage, Hannah Love Lanier, Travis Van Winkle, B.K. Cannon, Arturo Castro, Dominique Columbus, Beau Knapp and Bob Menery were added to the cast alongside Gyllenhaal.[12][13] Joaquim de Almeida, Darren Barnet, Kevin Carroll and J. D. Pardo were added to the cast later in the month.[14] In June 2023, Jessica Williams revealed she has a role in the film.[15]\n\nFilming[edit]\nFilming began in the Dominican Republic on August 23, 2022.[16][17] On March 3, 2023, Gyllenhaal shot a scene with former Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Jay Hieron following the ceremonial weigh-ins for UFC 285 at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The scene was done in front of fans who attended the weigh-ins and included UFC president Dana White, play-by-play announcer Jon Anik and other regular UFC event personnel.[18] A walkout scene with Gyllenhaal was filmed during an intermission in the event.[19]\n\nMusic[edit]\nVolker Bertelmann was originally set to compose the film's score,[20] but in January 2024, however, it was announced that he had left the project, with Christophe Beck replacing him.[21]\n\nRelease[edit]\nRoad House premiered at South by Southwest on March 8, 2024, as the opening night film, and was released in the United States via streaming on Prime Video by Amazon MGM Studios on March 21, 2024. It is the first film to be released as part of the centennial anniversary celebration of the founding of MGM, with a \"100th anniversary\" variant of its 2021 logo unveiled at the start of the film.[22] The film got a special theatrical release at 17 cinemas operated by the Army & Air Force Exchange Service on March 16, 2024.[23] Liman wrote an editorial piece in Deadline Hollywood criticizing Amazon for bypassing a wide theatrical release after they purchased MGM, and announced a $1 billion investment to release 12\u201315 films a year theatrically. He wrote that he would not attend the film's premiere at SXSW in protest.[24] Gyllenhaal responded by stating that while he sympathized with Liman's views, Amazon made it clear that it would have a streaming release for the film.[25] Liman ultimately attended the SXSW premiere.[26] On February 27, 2024, hoping to block the film's release, R. Lance Hill, screenwriter of the original 1989 version, sued MGM and Amazon, claiming copyright infringement and accusing the studio of using AI-generated voices of the actors to complete the project during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[27]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 60% of 193 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Road House updates a cult classic for a new generation, happily replicating the original's emphasis on cheesy brawn over narrative brains.\"[28] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[29]\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing \"If the first Road House was a better Chuck Norris movie, the new one is something more uncanny\u2014it's like a Jason Statham movie directed by Jonathan Demme\". He also thought it could have been \"a decisive hit\" if it had been theatrically released.[30] Christian Zilko of IndieWire gave it a B- grade, with praise for Gyllenhaal and McGregor's performances. He ended his review with, \"All in all, this Road House is a fitting update to its predecessor's legacy. Not because it's better, or even because it\u2019s all that similar, but because it moves with the same unselfconscious stupidity that fueled so many of the '80s blockbusters we remember so fondly\".[31] Robbie Collin of the Telegraph awarded the movie four stars out of five, writing that \u201cTogether with a psychopathic Conor McGregor, the star (Gyllenhaal) makes this tale of a drifter who rescues a community from a local kingpin fly.\u201d[32]\nChris Wasser of the Irish Independent gave the film two stars. He criticised the story, the performances of Jake Gyllenhaal and Conor McGregor, the direction of Doug Liman, and the fight sequences.[33]\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film a score of 2 out of 4. He criticized the extensive use of CGI for fight sequences. He wrote \"Punches and their reactions look like cut scenes in a video game far too often, especially a long bar brawl and a boat sequence in the end that have CGI so janky that I wonder if the reason that Prime didn't want this on a big screen was because people would be less likely to notice on a small screen\".[34]  Rocco T. Thompson of Slant Magazine wrote that \"any excitement evaporates as it becomes abundantly clear that the well-choreographed match-ups have been accentuated with unfortunate instances of CGI, undercutting the immersion of the action\". He gave it a score of 1.5 out of 4.[35] Kevin Maher of the Times awarded the movie two stars out of five, writing that \u201cJake Gyllenhaal is embarrassingly outshone by the mixed martial artist Conor McGregor in this pointless remake of the Eighties movie with Patrick Swayze.\u201d[36]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Road House (15)\".
