        "During 20th anniversary celebrations for the release of the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), film studio New Line Cinema announced in June 2021 that it was fast-tracking development of an anime prequel film with Warner Bros. Animation. Titled The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, the film is set 183 years before the events of The Two Towers and tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, who is explored in the appendices of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novel and is the namesake for the fortress Helm's Deep seen in The Two Towers. Kenji Kamiyama and Joseph Chou were set to direct and produce the film, respectively, after doing the same for Warner Bros.' anime television series Blade Runner: Black Lotus, with Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews writing the screenplay. The film was intended to be connected to the narrative of the film trilogy, with the trilogy's co-writer, Philippa Boyens, consulting on the prequel. The trilogy's director, Peter Jackson, and other co-writer, Fran Walsh, were not involved with the project.",
        "By February 2022, the script was being written by Phoebe Gittins, Boyens' daughter, and her writing partner Arty Papageorgiou, based on a story by Addiss and Matthews. Richard Taylor, the creative director of special effects company W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop, and illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe also joined the film's creative team after all working on the live-action trilogy.",
        "Voice casting for the film had begun by the time of its announcement in June 2021, and announcements were expected soon after February 2022. In June, Brian Cox was revealed to be voicing Helm, with Miranda Otto reprising her role of \u00c9owyn from the live-action films to serve as the narrator. Also revealed to be cast in the film were Gaia Wise, Luke Pasqualino, Lorraine Ashbourne, Yazdan Qafouri, Benjamin Wainwright, Laurence Ubong Williams, Shaun Dooley, Michael Wildman, Jude Akuwudike, Bilal Hasna, and Janine Duvitski.",
        "Sola Entertainment had begun work on the animation for the film by the time of its announcement in June 2021, and it will be its first production using hand-drawn animation in a style reminiscent of traditional anime productions. The film draws its visual inspiration from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy."
