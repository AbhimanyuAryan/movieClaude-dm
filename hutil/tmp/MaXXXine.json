It is the final installment of the X trilogy, following the 2022 films X and Pearl. The film stars Mia Goth, who reprises her role as Maxine (and also serves as producer), alongside Elizabeth Debicki, Moses Sumney, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito, and Kevin Bacon. In the film, as the only survivor of a massacre, Maxine sets out for fame and success in 1980s Los Angeles, while being stalked by a killer known as \"The Night Stalker.\"\nMaXXXine is scheduled to be released in the United States by A24 on July 5, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nAfter surviving a massacre in Texas,[a] Maxine continues to pursue her dreams of becoming a famous actress, all while evading the Night Stalker in 1985 Los Angeles.[2][3]\n\nCast[edit]\nMia Goth as Maxine Minx\nElizabeth Debicki as Elizabeth Bender, film director of The Puritan II[4]\nMoses Sumney\nMichelle Monaghan as an LAPD detective\nBobby Cannavale as an LAPD detective\nLily Collins\nHalsey\nGiancarlo Esposito as an agent for the adult film industry, and Z-list film actors\nKevin Bacon as a private investigator\nProduction[edit]\nAfter the Midnight Madness showing of Pearl at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, Ti West announced development for a third film, titled MaXXXine. Following the announcement, the filmmaker released a teaser clip for the film.[5] West wrote the script and will direct the film as well, with Mia Goth reprising her role as Maxine from the first film.[6][7] In April 2023, Elizabeth Debicki, Moses Sumney, Michelle Monaghan,  Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito and Kevin Bacon joined the cast. The film was produced by Little Lamb and Mad Solar.[8] [9]\nPrincipal photography took place from April to May 2023 in Los Angeles for seven weeks.[10][11][12] The film was towards the end of editing in February 2024.[13]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nOn September 13, 2022, a teaser trailer announcing a sequel to X, titled MaXXXine, was released shortly following the premiere of Pearl at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.[14] It featured the 1984 synth-pop song \"Obsession\" by Animotion.[15] Scott Wampler of Fangoria was delighted by the surprise announcement and called the teaser \"pitch-perfect, hall of fame\u2013level\".[16]\nOn May 1, 2023, a first-look image of Goth and Halsey in costume as their respective characters was shared on A24's and the film's social media accounts. They were captioned: \"The life she deserves\", referencing the personal mantra spoken throughout X by Maxine.[17] Glenn Rowley of Billboard noted Goth's dramatic costume shift from her \"Little House on the Prairie\u2013esque look\" to a \"tousled blonde mane and iridescent green windbreaker\".[18]\n\nMusic[edit]\nTyler Bates composed the film's score, as he did for X and Pearl.[19]\n\nRelease[edit]\nMaXXXine is scheduled to be released in the United States by A24 on July 5, 2024.[20]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ As depicted in X (2022)\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"All Future Releases\".
