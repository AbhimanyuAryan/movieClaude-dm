    "Plot": [
        "In 1966 southern California, Richard Monta\u00f1ez grows up as a hard working child with a strict father and supportive grandfather. He meets his future wife Judy in school where he begins selling burritos to other children. He is arrested at a young age when nobody believes that he earned his money honestly. As adults, Richard and Judy marry but live as hoodlums in a gang, hustling to survive. They make an effort to turn their lives around once Judy gets pregnant with their first child. A second child later, Richard and his family still struggle to make ends meet as Richard searches for honest work. He eventually turns to his friend, former hoodlum Tony Romero, who helps him get a job at Frito-Lay. Despite lying on his resum\u00e9, floor head Lonny Mason hires him.",
        "Richard begins paying attention to all the nuances of the factory and starts pursuing engineer maintenance leader Clarence C. Baker to teach him about the machines. Despite some reluctance, Baker agrees and teaches Richard how to operate all the machinery in the factory. Unfortunately, the Reagan administration begins to severely affect low-paying jobs and Frito-Lay's stocks begin to go down. This eventually results in some of the workers getting laid off. Frito-Lay CEO Roger Enrico releases a video encouraging the workers to \"think like a CEO\" which inspires Richard.",
        "After picking up his kids from school, Richard takes them out for elotes (Mexican street corn). Noticing that his youngest son Steven likes the spicy flavor, saying it \"burns good\", he realizes that the way to save Frito-Lay is to pitch the brand to the Latino market. He convinces Baker and the rest of his coworkers to let him take some unflavored Cheetos home, but Judy offers that he talk to his father Vacho first about a job. Vacho ends up belittling Richard's plans, causing Judy to support Richard even more. The Monta\u00f1ezes work tirelessly trying to find the perfect spicy flavor for Cheetos, eventually getting the right concoction. Richard attempts to pitch his idea to Lonny only to be turned down, forcing Richard to sneak in and copy Enrico's phone number.",
        "Richard manages to get through to Enrico who, while perplexed over being called by a janitor, is intrigued to learn that he saw his video and asks that he send his flavored Cheetos. He tastes them and is immediately hooked, setting up a meeting at the factory right away. While Lonny is upset with Richard, Richard prepares himself for the pitch, finally getting the approval of his father to back him up. Richard proceeds to speak from the heart and his pitch is accepted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos being put into production. While this results in more jobs, the new flavor is not flying off the shelves. Disappointed, Richard's children point out that there are no advertisements for the flavor. Richard returns to work and orders everyone to use their skills to sell the new flavor from the street. The tactic works and Enrico calls to ask that the factory produce an even bigger order.",
        "While Baker gets the promotion he always desired, Richard is still a janitor, though Baker gives him some support. Lonny asks Richard to clean upstairs, only to find Enrico who tells him that he understands his struggles growing up, before revealing that he has been promoted to Director of Multicultural Marketing. Richard is applauded by all his coworkers for his success and he happily calls Judy to tell her the good news."

        "In August 2019, it was reported Eva Longoria would direct Flamin' Hot, a film about Richard Monta\u00f1ez who claimed to have invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos, with DeVon Franklin producing under his Franklin Entertainment banner alongside Samuel Rodriguez, who served as the executive producer. Searchlight Pictures also contributed to the making of this film.",
        "Prior to the announcement, in April 2019, Franklin Entertainment was informed by Frito-Lay that Monta\u00f1ez's account of inventing Flamin' Hot Cheetos was disputed after an internal investigation had been prompted the previous year, but the producers elected to continue with the original premise. The script received rewrites prior to shooting due to the publication of a Los Angeles Times article in May 2021 disputing Monta\u00f1ez's account.",
        "In May 2021, Jesse Garcia and Annie Gonzalez joined the cast of the film. The film completed production in August 2021, and the cast was announced at that time."

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of 127 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Flamin' Hot may have a little more than its share of empty calories, but this fun feel-good story is still a decent cinematic snack.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Carlos Aguilar of Los Angeles Times said, \"Flamin' Hot turns out to be a surprisingly enjoyable crowd-pleaser. It mostly works because Garcia, Gonzalez and Longoria agree on a poignant, yet not sanctimonious approach that crystallizes the specific fortitude of mining hope from dire struggle.\" Brian Lowry of CNN said that Eva Longoria did an \"admirable job of wringing as much mileage as she can out of this underdog tale,\" and wrote, \"Playfully presented, it's the kind of mildly tasty cinematic snack that doesn't exactly stick to your ribs.\"",
        "John Nugent of Empire gave the film a grade of three out of five stars, praised the performances of Jesse Garcia and Annie Gonzalez, and complimented Eva Longoria's direction. Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent gave Flamin' Hot a grade of three out of five stars, complimented the chemistry between Jesse Garcia and Annie Gonzales, and stated that the film \" keep its audience on their toes\" owing to Eva Longoria.",
        "Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote: \"Flamin' Hot has so much to say about culture that it never gives its characters room to breathe outside the movie's 'message.' It makes for a film that doesn't seem to tell a true story as much as one that came off a product line from a Frito-Lay factory.\" Monica Castillo, also writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the movie two out of four stars: \"Overall, Flamin' Hot is more cheesy than spicy. Its focus on the 'Si, se puede ... trabajar y ganar dinero' mantra dulls the flavors of what makes the movie enjoyable: the family at the center of Richard's drive to survive.\""
