    "Plot": [
        "In 2048, eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) has been re-elected and have re-instituted the annual Purge with its original rules. Racial supremacy and nativism have surged nationwide following their re-election, and many outside the ruling party are concerned that the upcoming Purge will inflict more damage on the country than the NFFA realizes. Mexican couple Juan and Adela illegally cross the border into Texas to build a new life near Austin, with Juan working as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch while Adela works in town.",
        "Ten months later, on the eve of the 2049 Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a nationalist Purger group, who declare themselves to be the Purge Purification Force (PPF), intent on killing those people that they consider non-American. The migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Adela is attacked by two self-proclaimed Forever Purgers, but she is rescued by her boss, Darius, before the police arrests both for killing their attackers.",
        "Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T.T. discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their white farmhands\u00a0\u2013 Forever Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves. Patriarch Caleb Tucker sacrifices himself and distracts the Purgers long enough for Juan and T.T. to rescue his son Dylan, Dylan's pregnant wife Cassie, and Dylan's sister Harper. As they drive off to search for Adela, the news confirms that civilians nationwide, connecting via social media, have declared a Forever Purge, opposing NFFA orders to stand down.",
        "The group rescues Adela and Darius from Purgers. Darius stays behind to search for his family while the others escape from a burning Austin. At a gas station, they hear news reports that, to protect non-Purger civilians, Canada and Mexico have opened their borders for the next six hours. Following that, the borders will close and entry will be denied. The group decides to escape across the Mexican border at El Paso.",
        "By the time the group arrives in a chaotic El Paso, the NFFA has invoked martial law across the United States to contain the violence. Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T.T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF, with their Alpha Leader offering Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T.T. and Juan. When they refuse, the Purgers murder T.T. just before the military intervenes, allowing the group to escape. However, the military is forced to withdraw from El Paso when more Purgers destroy their base. In response, the Canadian and Mexican governments announced the early closure of their borders, leaving those who gathered to cross them vulnerable to the Purgers.",
        "Downtown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan had once been members of a self-defense group who trained them to fight against Mexican drug cartels. The diminished group reunites at a hidden safe house run by a local Native American tribe. The Native leader offers to transport everyone across the border as refugees. In the desert, Juan, Adela, and Dylan, with the Native leader and his men, stand against Alpha and the PPF, to make time for the other refugees to escape. When their ammo runs out, the group draws the PPF in for a close fight with hand weapons. In the ensuing battle, the Purgers are killed and Alpha takes Adela hostage. However, Juan and Dylan work together to subdue and kill Alpha. The trio rejoins the others in a refugee camp across the Mexican border, where Dylan finds Harper and Cassie\u00a0\u2013 and meets his newborn daughter.",
        "News reports indicate that the NFFA has dispatched troops but is effectively being destroyed by the violence it no longer controls; more than two million Americans had crossed the Canadian and Mexican borders as refugees, and civilians in America are rallying to fight back against the Purgers."

        "In the United States and Canada, The Forever Purge was released alongside The Boss Baby: Family Business, as well as the expansion of Summer of Soul, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 3,051 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $5.4 million on its first day, including $1.3 million from Thursday night previews, the lowest amount of the franchise. It went on to debut to $12.7 million, finishing third at the box office.

The film fell 43.1% in its sophomore weekend to $7.1 million, finishing fourth, then made $4.2 million in its third weekend, finishing in sixth.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 49% based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"The Forever Purge fails to fully engage with its most frighteningly timely themes, but the franchise remains largely\u2014albeit bluntly\u2014effective.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 72% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "The Playlist's Nick Allen gave the film \"D+,\" writing that it \"looks like a cheap TV movie\" and that it \"displays all that makes these movies a failed experiment in blockbuster exploitation.\" Reviewing for The A.V. Club, Anya Stanley gave the film a \"D\" grade, and said: \"In The Forever Purge, we're told a story that a battered nation has heard a lot\u2014a sermon of immigration and class warfare that's too heavy-handed to say anything its prospective audience hasn't been told on countless social media feeds over the last few years.\" Rick Bentley's review in Tribune News Service complained of \"a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the tensions currently gripping this country. The film\u2019s deep dive into racism comes across as manipulative, trite and uninspired.\" Dustin Chase wrote in The Galveston Daily News, \"The Forever Purge comes to Texas to try to redefine stale franchise.\" Johnny Oleksinski's review in The New York Post stated: \"That idea was fun once, maybe even twice, but by the fifth outing the formula has given way to preachiness and predictability.\"",
        "Writing in The Detroit News, Adam Gram stated: \"The fifth Purge talks a big game, employing all sorts of charged political words and theories, but doesn't do anything interesting with them.\" Peter Vonder Haar's review in The Houston Press analyzed: \"The biggest problem with The Forever Purge is how it abandons the central conceit of the series. Previous movies focused on the protagonists' struggle to survive until the end of the Purge while simultaneously giving us wider looks at the phenomenon itself. Here, with the murderousness extending indefinitely, the characters' situation is indistinguishable from any of a thousand other shoot-em-ups.\" Candace McMillan wrote in Seattle Refined that the film is \"ultimately just a tiresome rehash of an overused adage. It's making an obvious statement about the callous attitude we as Americans take with those less fortunate, without accounting for the many complications and intricacies within our nation as well. But shock, awe, and letdown is all that's left of a franchise that's been bled dry.\"",
        "Matthew Mongale's review for The Austin Chronicle dismissed the film as \"pretty much by the numbers\", while Nick Rogers in The Midwest Film Journal called the film: \"The creative exhaustion of a once-engaging franchise.\"  Ian Freer in Empire wrote: \"The fifth Purge outing goes for broke and comes out wanting, working neither as political commentary nor horror-action-thriller.\""
