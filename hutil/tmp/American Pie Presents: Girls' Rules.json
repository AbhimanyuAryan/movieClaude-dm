The film serves as a standalone sequel, revolving around Steve Stifler's relative Stephanie (Lizze Broadway) and her friends.\nThe film was released on demand and DVD on October 6, 2020, by Universal Pictures.[3][4] It was released on Blu-ray on September 7, 2021.[5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nNow that it is their senior year, four young friends named Annie, Kayla, Michelle and Stephanie band together to get what they want.\nAnnie is trying to lose her virginity to her boyfriend. Stephanie is a confident lacrosse player who is blackmailing her school\u2019s perverted principal into retiring by recording him being chained up and whipped by her. Kayla is insecure about her boyfriend Tim cheating and constantly goes through his phone asking if she is the best girlfriend he has ever had. Michelle is a sex toy expert who prides herself on her knowledge. \nThey all make a pact to get what they need this year. Along comes Grant, a handsome new guy in school. He meets Michelle first as she is rushing to class, as she is distracted by the sight of him, she runs into a door and he helps her up.\nTim breaks up with Kayla and as Grant witnesses this, he offers help in making her ex jealous. Stephanie is playing lacrosse and meets Grant by knocking him to the ground during a play.\nMichelle takes Annie to a sex shop to buy her first toy, a vibrating set of panties. Annie uses it later that day while having phone sex with her boyfriend. Grant and his mother Ellen come over to introduce themselves, especially Ellen to Annie\u2019s single father Kevin, who tells Grant to go upstairs and meet his daughter.\nMichelle and Stephanie end up liking Grant and employ ways to win his affection. Michelle, playing the damsel in distress trips and falls into a locker in front of him. He takes her to the nurse and Oliver, the principal's assistant, a nerdy boy who has a crush on her, helps out. Stephanie goes to Grant's friend Emmett (her old friend who she had a falling out with) and asks for his help, giving him $100.\nAnnie runs into Grant in the library and they team up to study and slowly start falling for each other. Kayla and Tim start having sex clandestinely. Stephanie and Emmett spend more and more time together to help her win over Grant and start falling for each other. Things come to a head at Ellen\u2019s house party when the girls realize they all know and have crushes on Grant. \nGrant says he has a crush on Annie and they kiss. She feels guilty and goes to see her boyfriend Jason at college and catches him getting a blowjob from a girl. Initially angry, she feels relief because she realizes she has feelings for Grant.\nEllen helps Michelle realize that Oliver is the perfect guy for her as he also has a love of John F. Kennedy and when doing an imitation of his speech she realizes she likes him. They all go to a party thrown by Stephanie in an attempt to get together with Grant. Realizing that Grant likes Annie they call off the pact. A fight breaks out when Stephanie gets called a slut and Emmett defends her, which then causes Stephanie to punch the assailant and throw him out. Emmett and Stephanie kiss, realizing the whole time they had feelings for each other. Kayla and Tim get back together. Michelle and Oliver end up together. \nJason shows up and inaccurately describes the girls' pact to Grant, who leaves as he feels used. The girls all go to the pajama prom together and help Annie win back Grant. He shows up and they kiss. Their friends set up a tent on the football field so Annie can finally lose her virginity. They all end up having sex with their respective partners.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nMadison Pettis as Annie\nLizze Broadway as Stephanie Stifler\nPiper Curda as Kayla\nNatasha Behnam as Michelle\nDarren Barnet as Grant\nZachary Gordon as Emmett\nCamaron Engels as Tim\nZayne Emory as Jason\nChristian Valderrama as Oliver\nSara Rue as Ellen\nEd Quinn as Kevin\nDanny Trejo as Janitor Steve Garcia\nLucas Adams as McCormick\nPatricia Elliott as MeePaw\nBarry Bostwick as PeePaw\nRasheda Crockett as Rose\nTatiana DeMaria as Lead Singer\n\nDevelopment[edit]\nAfter the success of American Pie Presents: The Book of Love, writer David H.
