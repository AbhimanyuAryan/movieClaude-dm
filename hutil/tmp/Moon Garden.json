    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 29 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"If writer-director Ryan Stevens Harris' story is somewhat less compelling than his bizarrely transfixing visuals, Moon Garden remains a mind-bending achievement of dark DIY fantasy.\"",
        "Sharai Bohannon of Dread Central praised the film's setting and the Teeth character, and wrote, \"Moon Garden's world, and the imagery it provides, are what will keep audiences talking. It's so absorbing that it makes it hard to dwell on things that aren't working in the film.\""
