Walker[1]\nMorgana Ignis as Teeth[6]\nRelease[edit]\nMoon Garden had its world premiere at the 25th Dances With Films Festival in Los Angeles, California, on June 10, 2022.[7] On October 8, 2022, the film screened at the Grimmfest Film Festival in the United Kingdom.[10][11] On November 3, 2022, it screened at the 9th FilmQuest Film Festival in Provo, Utah.[12] In April 2023, it screened at Panic Fest in Kansas City, Missouri.[13]\nMoon Garden was released in select cinemas in the United States by Oscilloscope Laboratories in May 2023.[8][9]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 29 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"If writer-director Ryan Stevens Harris' story is somewhat less compelling than his bizarrely transfixing visuals, Moon Garden remains a mind-bending achievement of dark DIY fantasy.\"[14]\nSharai Bohannon of Dread Central praised the film's setting and the Teeth character, and wrote, \"Moon Garden's world, and the imagery it provides, are what will keep audiences talking. It's so absorbing that it makes it hard to dwell on things that aren't working in the film.\"[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f Miska, Brad (February 13, 2023). \"Fantasy and Horror Collide in Stunning Trailer for 'Moon Garden'\".
