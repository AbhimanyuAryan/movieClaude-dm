    "Reception": [
        "The film received mostly poor reviews. The Guardian described Lola as \"poverty porn - the exploitation of the conditions of poverty for entertainment and artistic recognition\" adding that \"Lola, whose protagonist careens from one traumatic experience to the next, doesn\u2019t explore hardship \u2013 it exploits it\". Writing for Review Online, Ayeen Forootan states that \"there\u2019s nothing really surprising or new to be found in Lola\u2019s poorly scripted and stereotypically melodramatic story, which is mostly realized as typical arrangements of manufactured intensity and overt sentiment-baiting.\""
