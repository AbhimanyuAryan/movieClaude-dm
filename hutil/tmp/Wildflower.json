The website's consensus reads: \"Wildflower benefits from its appealing ensemble cast, but their efforts aren't quite enough to distinguish this middling coming-of-age story.\"[7] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 52 out of 100, based on 7 reviews indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[8]\nWilliam Bibbiani, writing for TheWrap, said that the film \"can't seem to decide if it's a big mess or a formulaic teen drama, but when it gives us tender moments between its characters, it\u2019s hard to really care.\"[9] Lovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film \"might not be a radical departure from films of its type, but it does offer buoyant performances from both fresh and familiar faces.\"[10]\nIn a review titled \"When Disability Representation Goes Wrong\", Sarah Milner of /Film criticized its approach to portraying disability and described it as \"inspiration porn.\" She criticized the portrayal of Sharon and Derek in particular, calling the characters \"paper-thin punchlines.\"[3] Wendy Ide in a review for Screen Daily compared the film to CODA (2021), but felt that Wildflower fell short in its portrayal of disabled parents by comparison.[11] Charles Bramesco, writing for ThePlaylist.net, gave the film a C\u2212 rating and described its exploration of themes as shallow.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kiernan Shipka on Her \"Emotionally Complex\" Role in 'Wildflower'\".
