    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 64% of 40 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Wildflower benefits from its appealing ensemble cast, but their efforts aren't quite enough to distinguish this middling coming-of-age story.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 52 out of 100, based on 7 reviews indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "William Bibbiani, writing for TheWrap, said that the film \"can't seem to decide if it's a big mess or a formulaic teen drama, but when it gives us tender moments between its characters, it\u2019s hard to really care.\" Lovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film \"might not be a radical departure from films of its type, but it does offer buoyant performances from both fresh and familiar faces.\"",
        "In a review titled \"When Disability Representation Goes Wrong\", Sarah Milner of /Film criticized its approach to portraying disability and described it as \"inspiration porn.\" She criticized the portrayal of Sharon and Derek in particular, calling the characters \"paper-thin punchlines.\" Wendy Ide in a review for Screen Daily compared the film to CODA (2021), but felt that Wildflower fell short in its portrayal of disabled parents by comparison. Charles Bramesco, writing for ThePlaylist.net, gave the film a C\u2212 rating and described its exploration of themes as shallow."
