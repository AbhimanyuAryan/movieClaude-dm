Eighteen years later, Melissa reaches out to David through the adoption agency, leading to their connection on social media and ultimately meeting face-to-face."

        "Kirk Cameron approached the Kendricks, with whom he had previously worked on Fireproof, to produce the movie after seeing David's story depicted in I Lived on Parker Avenue. For the time jump, the filmmakers chose to use two sets of actors to play David's birth parents, while de-aging techniques to depict David's adoptive parents. \"Kirk Cameron looks like a 50-year-old and a (roughly) 30-year-old \u2013 all in the same film,\" Crosswalk.com observed. Coles was involved in the creative process, being invited by the producers to help evaluate actresses who would play her, and Long subsequently spent time with Coles preparing for the role. A novelization by Chris Fabry (ISBN\u00a0978-1496461278) was released by Tyndale House approximately one month before the film's release.",
        "Alex Kendrick said that they could not secure distribution because the film concerned abortion, which Cameron attributed to studios' cowardice. In an interview with Baptist Press, executive producer Stephen Kendrick noted that \"Lifemark doesn\u2019t focus in on the dark side of abortion, it focuses in on the positive beautiful side of adoption.\" Anti-abortion organizations such as Live Action have used the film as a jumping off point to criticize abortion."
