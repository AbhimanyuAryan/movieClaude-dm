        "In October 2021, it was reported that Daisy Ridley secretly shot an independent drama in Astoria, Oregon; the project would later be announced in December 2021 in which Ridley also produced the film with Rachel Lambert directing. The screenplay by Kevin Armento is a partial adaptation of his own 2013 play Killers, with Stefanie Abel Horowitz, who directed a 2019 short of the same name, also a screenwriter along with Katy Wright-Mead. All three had also been credited with screenwriting the 2019 short and Horowitz had also directed the 2013 play.",
        "The film is set in a small city on the coast of Oregon. Ridley told a crowd at Sundance that she related to Fran saying \"Like, sometimes I feel like a piece of fucking shit. And sometimes I feel, like, great\u2026What was interesting with Fran was sometimes she's sort of obnoxious. Sometimes, she's like, 'I don't want to play your games. I don't want to talk about food. I'm good, I'm apart from this.' And other times, she's like, 'How do I become part of this?' So I resonated with that."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 110 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Departing from corporate comedy, Sometimes I Think About Dying modestly explores critical human connection through a superbly melancholic Daisy Ridley.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Helen O'Hara  in Empire described a \"beautiful, subdued Daisy Ridley performance\" and wrote \"if you\u2019re tired of blockbuster bombast, this could be the antidote\". Peter Debruge in Variety said, \"Movies tend to cut these bits out, to focus on the escapist stuff, but every once in a while one comes along, searching for poetry in the mundane.\" Ridley's character Fran's daydreams are shown as images, and Debruge noted that those \"scenes are unexpected, surreal, accompanied by a lovely, meditative string score from composer Dabney Morris. Fran doesn't seem suicidal, but she isn't particularly engaged in life either. The character\u2019s personality is so understated, it's strange to find someone of Ridley's stature drawn to such a self-effacing role\". Lovia Gyarkye said in The Hollywood Reporter, \"Loneliness is the subject of a poetic exploration\u2026Fran is too distinctively drawn to be just an avatar, but the impressions of her solitude are aching reminders of how modern life nurtures an unsettling separateness\u2026 Sometimes I Think About Dying, then, is a graceful treatise on how challenging \u2014 but liberating \u2014 it can be to make connections.\""
