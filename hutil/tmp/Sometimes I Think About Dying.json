It is based on the 2013 play Killers by Armento, and a short film was released in 2019, directed and co-written by Horowitz. The film stars Daisy Ridley, Dave Merheje, Parvesh Cheena, Marcia DeBonis, Meg Stalter, Brittany O'Grady, and Bree Elrod.\nThe film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2023, and was released on January 26, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nFran is a socially awkward office worker who spends most of her time in isolation and daydreams of her own death, when a new colleague pricks the bubble of her own isolation.[5]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDaisy Ridley as Fran\nDave Merheje as Robert\nParvesh Cheena as Garrett\nMarcia DeBonis as Carol\nMeg Stalter  as Isobel\nBrittany O'Grady as Sophie\nBree Elrod as Amelia\nLauren Beveridge as Tellulah\nAyanna Berkshire as Emma\nSean Tarjyoto as Sean\nJeb Berrier as Doug\nRich Hinz as Rich\nJune Eisler as June\nTreasure Lunan as Bennie\nProduction[edit]\nIn October 2021, it was reported that Daisy Ridley secretly shot an independent drama in Astoria, Oregon;[6] the project would later be announced in December 2021 in which Ridley also produced the film with Rachel Lambert directing.[7] The screenplay by Kevin Armento is a partial adaptation of his own 2013 play Killers, with Stefanie Abel Horowitz, who directed a 2019 short of the same name, also a screenwriter along with Katy Wright-Mead. All three had also been credited with screenwriting the 2019 short and Horowitz had also directed the 2013 play.[8]\nThe film is set in a small city on the coast of Oregon.[9] Ridley told a crowd at Sundance that she related to Fran saying \"Like, sometimes I feel like a piece of fucking shit. And sometimes I feel, like, great\u2026What was interesting with Fran was sometimes she's sort of obnoxious. Sometimes, she's like, 'I don't want to play your games. I don't want to talk about food. I'm good, I'm apart from this.' And other times, she's like, 'How do I become part of this?' So I resonated with that.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nSometimes I Think About Dying premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2023.[11] In April 2023, Oscilloscope acquired the US distribution rights to the film.[12] The UK distribution rights were acquired by Vertigo Releasing in May 2023.[13] It was released in the United States on January 26, 2024.[14] It is scheduled to be released in the UK on April 19, 2024.[2]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 110 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Departing from corporate comedy, Sometimes I Think About Dying modestly explores critical human connection through a superbly melancholic Daisy Ridley.\"[15] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[16]\n Helen O'Hara  in Empire described a \"beautiful, subdued Daisy Ridley performance\" and wrote \"if you\u2019re tired of blockbuster bombast, this could be the antidote\".[17] Peter Debruge in Variety said, \"Movies tend to cut these bits out, to focus on the escapist stuff, but every once in a while one comes along, searching for poetry in the mundane.\" Ridley's character Fran's daydreams are shown as images, and Debruge noted that those \"scenes are unexpected, surreal, accompanied by a lovely, meditative string score from composer Dabney Morris. Fran doesn't seem suicidal, but she isn't particularly engaged in life either. The character\u2019s personality is so understated, it's strange to find someone of Ridley's stature drawn to such a self-effacing role\".[18] Lovia Gyarkye said in The Hollywood Reporter, \"Loneliness is the subject of a poetic exploration\u2026Fran is too distinctively drawn to be just an avatar, but the impressions of her solitude are aching reminders of how modern life nurtures an unsettling separateness\u2026 Sometimes I Think About Dying, then, is a graceful treatise on how challenging \u2014 but liberating \u2014 it can be to make connections.\"[19] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph awarded the movie four stars out of five, writing that \u201cAfter a disappointing post-Star Wars run, Ridley has finally found her groove with this enjoyable \u2013 and surprisingly mushy \u2013 romcom.\u201d[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Sometimes I Think About Dying\".
