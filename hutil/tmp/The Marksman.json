    "Plot": [
        "Former US Marine Corps Scout Sniper and Vietnam War veteran Jim Hanson, a widower, lives along the Arizona-Mexico border with his dog, Jackson. While tending his ranch, which he is behind in payments on, he reports illegal border crossings to the United States Border Patrol, where his step-daughter Sarah works. One day he encounters Rosa and her son Miguel, Mexican citizens fleeing from the Mexican Mafia. As Hanson calls border patrol, a cartel gang led by Mauricio approaches and a shootout ensues, in which Hanson shoots and kills Mauricio's brother and Rosa is fatally wounded. Before dying, Rosa gives Hanson her family's address in Chicago and a bag of cash, begging him to take Miguel there, to which Hanson reluctantly agrees.",
        "Border patrol show up after her death and take in Miguel. One of the cartel members comes in and claims that he's a relative of Miguel. Hanson happens to see their car there and sneaks Miguel out to go to safety. Meanwhile the gang bribe corrupt patrol officers to gain entry to the United States, and conduct their own manhunt in search for Miguel.",
        "After Hanson uses his credit card to repair his truck, Mauricio tracks the pair to Route 66 in Oklahoma. However their road journey is interrupted when a patrol officer pulls them over and instructs Hanson into his squad car using an apparent cover story. The officer then telephones the gang in order to turn in Miguel, in which Hanson becomes suspicious. Knowing that the cop is corrupt, Hanson confronts him and a struggle ensues. Hanson and Miguel flee to a nearby hill, where they witness the gang cartel arrive and roughly question the officer (who awoke from unconsciousness), then shoot him dead.",
        "Hanson and Miguel continue to make their way north. While staying at a motel, Hanson bribes the receptionist to not register him and Miguel as guests before the cartel shows up and during the escape, they kill Jackson. The patch on the truck's radiator fails while attempting to get away from the cartel and they are forced to stop. Eventually, Mauricio and his men catch up to Hanson and a firefight breaks out on a nearby farm. Hanson manages to kill three of the cartel members, but Mauricio captures Miguel.",
        "After a skirmish, Hanson is stabbed but seriously wounds Mauricio with a gunshot. Hanson offers him a coup de gr\u00e2ce leaving a single bullet in his gun or a choice to shoot Hanson. As Hanson and Miguel leave the farm, they hear a gunshot, indicating that Mauricio chose to commit suicide.",
        "The pair eventually reach Miguel's family in Chicago and drop him off at his family's home. The film ends with Hanson, still wounded from earlier, getting on a bus and closing his eyes."

        "Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote: \"Predictable to a fault, the movie coasts pleasurably on Neeson's seasoned, sad-sweet charisma.\" Michael O'Sullivan at The Washington Post rated the film 2/4 stars, writing that it \"proves itself to be the cinematic version of comfort food: satisfyingly familiar but full of starch and empty calories.\"",
        "Owen Gleiberman at Variety, gave a more negative review, stating \"Lorenz stages the action with a convincing ebb and flow, but thanks to an undercooked script what happens in between is mostly boilerplate.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a C\u2212 and wrote \"...The Marksman might be two three-ways short of The Mule, but almost everything about it \u2014 from its 'get off my lawn' misanthropy to its general take on the uselessness of government in American life \u2014 feels geared for a late-career Eastwood vehicle.\""
