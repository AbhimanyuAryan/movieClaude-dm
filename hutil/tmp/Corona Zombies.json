The film stars Cody Renee Cameron, Russell Coker and Robin Sydney.\nCorona Zombies was released digitally through Full Moon Features' website and app on April 10, 2020. Later that year, it was followed by two sequels also directed by Band, Barbie & Kendra Save the Tiger King and Barbie & Kendra Storm Area 51, with Cameron and Sydney reprising their roles.[2][3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nInspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, the film stars Cody Renee Cameron as Barbie, a woman who finds herself facing an outbreak of zombies infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[4]\n\nCast[edit]\nCody Renee Cameron as Barbie[1]\nRussell Coker as Corona Zombie\nRobin Sydney as Kendra\nProduction[edit]\nCorona Zombies was filmed over a period of 28 days.[1][4] The film consists primarily of redubbed and repurposed footage from Hell of the Living Dead and Zombies vs. Strippers, as well as clips of real-world news footage.[4][5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered digitally through Full Moon Features' website and app on April 10, 2020.[1][4][6]\n\nReception[edit]\nStuart Heritage of The Guardian called the film \"the sort of thing you'd watch drunk in your house at midnight. But then again, that's how you're going to watch all films for the foreseeable future, so it has to be worth a go.\"[1] The National's Katy Gillett, in her review of the film, wrote: \"If zombie movies are your thing, and you can acknowledge them as pure escapism that isn't to be taken seriously, then you're probably fine. If not, I'd skip it.\"[7] Alan Ng of Film Threat called Corona Zombies \"a hilarious satire of this whole pandemic\", comparing it favorably to the 1966 film What's Up, Tiger Lily? and the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.[8]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAwards\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n2021\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n\nWorst Director\n\nCharles Band (also for Barbie & Kendra Save the Tiger King and Barbie & Kendra Storm Area 51)\n\nNominated\n\n[9]\n\n\nWorst Screenplay\n\nKent Roudebush, Silvia St. Croix and Billy Butler (also for Barbie & Kendra Save the Tiger King and Barbie & Kendra Storm Area 51)\n\nNominated\n\n[9]\n\nSequels[edit]\nCorona Zombies was followed by two sequels, Barbie & Kendra Save the Tiger King and Barbie & Kendra Storm Area 51.[2][3] Both sequels were directed by Band, star Cody Renee Cameron as Barbie and Robin Sydney as Kendra, and were released in 2020.[2][3]\n\nSee also[edit]\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\nCorona (film)\nCoronavirus (india film)\nSongbird\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e Heritage, Stuart (April 13, 2020). \"Corona Zombies: the terrible movie we might just need right now\".
