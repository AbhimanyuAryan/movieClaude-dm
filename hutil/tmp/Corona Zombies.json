        "Stuart Heritage of The Guardian called the film \"the sort of thing you'd watch drunk in your house at midnight. But then again, that's how you're going to watch all films for the foreseeable future, so it has to be worth a go.\" The National's Katy Gillett, in her review of the film, wrote: \"If zombie movies are your thing, and you can acknowledge them as pure escapism that isn't to be taken seriously, then you're probably fine. If not, I'd skip it.\" Alan Ng of Film Threat called Corona Zombies \"a hilarious satire of this whole pandemic\", comparing it favorably to the 1966 film What's Up, Tiger Lily? and the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000."
