        "The film was announced in April 2022, with Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson starring, Jonathan Jacobson writing the screenplay, and Nicol Paone set to direct.  In April 2022, it was announced that Joe Manganiello was cast. In May 2022, Dree Hemingway was revealed to have joined the cast. That same month, reality television star Leah McSweeney was revealed to be making her feature film debut in the project, and shortly afterwards Maya Hawke was announced as working with her mother, Thurman, on a project for the first time. In June 2022, WWE wrestler Liv Morgan was announced to have joined the cast.",
        "Principal photography began in New York and New Jersey in early 2022. Filming was reported in Hoboken at Field Colony, a coworking space within an art gallery that was used as the primary shooting location. The furniture was removed and flat floor-to-ceiling flat panels were installed to recreate a 'white box' art gallery. Novado Gallery in Jersey City was used as a secondary art gallery for the film. Filming was scheduled to finish in June 2022, but issues with weather caused a delay and a re-location to Lavallette, New Jersey in October 2022."
