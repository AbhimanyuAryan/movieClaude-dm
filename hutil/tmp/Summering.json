        "The film has a 34% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Summering is a harmless enough coming-of-age story, but there are far superior -- and far less saccharine -- entries in this crowded genre.\" Metacritic rated the film a 50 out of 100 based on 17 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"There are things to talk about after the movie ends. And it doesn\u2019t ever talk down to its intended audience. If anything, the adults are the ones desperately in need of connecting with their inner kid.\" Fred Topel of United Press International also gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"Summering is like a female Amblin movie.\"",
        "Guy Lodge of Variety gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"Too much of Summering, however, plays out in an unsatisfying middle ground: embedded neither in real life, nor in its heroines\u2019 restless, malleable imaginations.\" Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"But alas, its potential for magic is dulled by uneven performances, unconvincing chemistry and an uninspiring script.\" Natalia Winkelman of IndieWire graded the film a C\u2212 and wrote, \"As is, Summering is too scattered and silly for us to really care.\""
