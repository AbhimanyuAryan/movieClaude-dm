The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nPam Bales is a search and rescue volunteer who sets off one fateful morning on a hike taking her to the top of Mount Washington. Suddenly a fierce storm sets in but she sees tracks in the snow of someone wearing only sneakers. She comes across a strange-acting, incoherent man she calls \"John\" and the two begin a dangerous trek down the mountain to safety, facing many obstacles along the way and almost drowning at one point. During this time, Pam has various \"flashbacks\" regarding her two young daughters who died in a gas leak accident. After almost freezing to death, the two manage to make it to safety only to have \"John\" drive off suddenly without so much as a thank you. Pam tries to find out his real name and at the end, the two have an emotional meeting at a coffee shop where she mentions that her two little girls died from a gas leak and he mentions a loved one that had frozen to death on the mountain the previous year.\n\nCast[edit]\nNaomi Watts as Pam Bales\nBilly Howle[4] as John\nDenis O'Hare[4] as Dave\nParker Sawyers[4] as Patrick\nEliot Sumner as Hiker Bill\nJosh Rollins as Finn\nProduction[edit]\nIn February 2021, it was announced Naomi Watts, Sophie Okonedo, Billy Howle, Denis O'Hare and Parker Sawyers had joined the cast of the film, with Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska and Micha\u0142 Englert set to direct the film, from a screenplay by Josh Rollins.
