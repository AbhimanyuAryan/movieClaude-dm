The film stars Keke Palmer, Jonny Lee Miller, Common, Gaius Charles, and Alicia Witt.\nAlice had its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2022,[4] and was released in the United States on March 18, 2022, by Roadside Attractions and Vertical Entertainment. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was nominated in three categories for the NAACP Image Awards, and nominated for the Saturn Award for best independent film.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAlice is enslaved on a 19th-century style plantation in Georgia, owned by Paul Bennet. Attempting to escape, she runs through a vast forest and emerges onto a Georgia highway in 1973. She meets Frank, a truck driver who helps her adjust to the truth of the time period, and that she has been misled her whole life. After reading some books explaining when and how all other plantations ended, and tracking down Rachel, the ex-wife of her \"owner\", she is able to convince Frank about the plantation. Inspired by Pam Grier's character in the film Coffy, she persuades Frank to go back with her, so that she can exact revenge on Bennet and free the rest of the \"domestics\" being held there.\n\nCast[edit]\nKeke Palmer as Alice\nJonny Lee Miller as Paul Bennett\nCommon as Frank\nGaius Charles as Joseph\nNatasha Yvette Williams as Ruth\nAlicia Witt as Rachel\nMadelon Curtis as Mrs Bennett\nJaxon Goldenberg as Daniel Bennett\nKenneth Farmer as Moses\nNatasha Williams as Ruth\nCraig Stark as Aaron\nProduction[edit]\nIn September 2019, it was announced Krystin Ver Linden would direct and write the film.[5] The publicity for the film states that it is \"inspired by the true events of a woman of servitude in 1800s Georgia, who escapes the 55-acre confines of her captor to discover the shocking reality that exists beyond the tree line ... it's 1973.\"[6][7] Elements of the film's background are loosely based on the narrative of Mae Louise Miller, who escaped from slavery in the 1960s.[8]\nIn June 2020, Keke Palmer, Common, Jonny Lee Miller, and Sinqua Walls joined the cast of the film, with Palmer also serving as an executive producer.[6][9][10] In November 2020, Gaius Charles and Alicia Witt joined the cast of the film.[11]\nPrincipal photography began in October 2020 in Savannah, Georgia.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt had its premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2022.[4] Prior to, Roadside Attractions and Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film.[13]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, the film earned $173,624 from 169 theaters in its opening weekend.[14]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 29% of 70 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.8/10.
