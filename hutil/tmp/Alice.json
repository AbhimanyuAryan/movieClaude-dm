        "Alice is enslaved on a 19th-century style plantation in Georgia, owned by Paul Bennet. Attempting to escape, she runs through a vast forest and emerges onto a Georgia highway in 1973. She meets Frank, a truck driver who helps her adjust to the truth of the time period, and that she has been misled her whole life. After reading some books explaining when and how all other plantations ended, and tracking down Rachel, the ex-wife of her \"owner\", she is able to convince Frank about the plantation. Inspired by Pam Grier's character in the film Coffy, she persuades Frank to go back with her, so that she can exact revenge on Bennet and free the rest of the \"domestics\" being held there."
