It stars Naomi Watts, Andrew Lincoln and Jacki Weaver. The book and film are based on a true story of Sam and Cameron Bloom's family and their interactions with an Australian magpie named 'Penguin'.[4]\nIt was theatrically released in Australia by Roadshow Films on 21 January 2021 and digitally in the United States by Netflix on 27 January.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nDuring a family vacation in Thailand, Sam Bloom accidentally falls off a high balcony and breaks her T6 thoracic vertebrae resulting in partial paralysis. Back home in Australia, Sam, an avid surfer, struggles to adjust to life in a wheelchair, but is supported by her husband Cameron, their three sons Noah, Rueben, and Oli, and Sam's overbearing mother Jan.\nOne afternoon, the three boys find and bring home an injured magpie chick who they name Penguin. Sam is initially too despondent to care for Penguin but understands it's important to Noah, and as time goes on, she bonds with her. Noah feels guilty for being the one who asked his mum to go up to the balcony in Thailand and has withdrawn from her since the accident. Sam and Cameron's relationship also deteriorates as she struggles to find joy in daily life and wishes to forget who she was before the fall since she can no longer live in the same way. She demands he never ask her how she is.\nAfter several weeks, Penguin fully recovers and learns to fly, inspiring Sam to want to do something for herself; she starts kayaking lessons. For Sam's birthday, the Blooms go for dinner at Jan's house, joined by Sam's sister Kylie and Sam's kayaking instructor Gaye. While Jan and Cameron argue about Sam's new life and their responsibilities to her, Penguin is attacked by two larger birds and then flies away.\nSam eventually confronts Noah about his guilt and tells him he is not to blame for what happened to her. She apologises for being distant and reveals she has found her strength, and the whole family reconcile. Sam asks Cameron to ask her how she is, and when he does, she replies, \"I'm better.\"\nPenguin returns home a few days later, and Sam thanks her for helping her recover.\n\nCast[edit]\nNaomi Watts as Sam Bloom, Cameron's wife and Jan's daughter.\nAndrew Lincoln as Cameron Bloom, Sam's husband\nGriffin Murray-Johnston as Noah Bloom\nFelix Cameron as Rueben Bloom\nAbe Clifford-Barr as Oli Bloom\nJacki Weaver as Jan, Sam's mother\nRachel House as Gaye\nLeeanna Walsman as Kylie\nLisa Hensley as Bron\nProduction[edit]\nThe rights to the book were acquired in December 2016 by Bruna Papandrea. Naomi Watts was set to star and to co-produce with Mark Audet, Emma Cooper, and Made Up Stories.[5][6] In June 2017, Shaun Grant was hired to write the screenplay.[7] By February 2019, Glendyn Ivin was set to direct, and in July Andrew Lincoln, Jacki Weaver and Rachel House were added to the cast.[8][9][10]\nFilming began in Australia in early August 2019.[11][6][12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nPenguin Bloom had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September 2020.[13]\nThe film was released theatrically in Australia on 21 January 2021 by Roadshow Films,[14] and hit number one at the Australian box office for its opening weekend.[15]\nNetflix released the film in North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa,  France and select Asian countries on 27 January 2021.[16]\n\nReception[edit]\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 67% approval rating based on 84 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Penguin Bloom's fact-based story could have been adapted with greater nuance, but strong work from Naomi Watts and Andrew Lincoln adds some much-needed heart.\"[17] According to Metacritic, which sampled 17 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".[18]\nThe script for Penguin Bloom by Shaun Grant and Harry Cripps was shortlisted for the Betty Roland Prize for Scriptwriting at the 2021 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards.[19]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremonydate\n\nCategory\n\nSubject\n\nResult\n\nRef\n\n\nAACTA Awards\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\nBest Film\n\nEmma Cooper\n\nNominated\n\n[20]\n\n\nSteve Hutensky\n\nNominated\n\n\nJodi Matterson\n\nNominated\n\n\nBruna Papandrea\n\nNominated\n\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Direction\n\nGlendyn Ivin\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nHarry Cripps\n\nNominated\n\n\nShaun Grant\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nJacki Weaver\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nSam Chiplin\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Music Score\n\nMarcelo Zarvos\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nAnnie Beauchamp\n\nNominated\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Ivin, Glendyn. \"Penguin Bloom\".
