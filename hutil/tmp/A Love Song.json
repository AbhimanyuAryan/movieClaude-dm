    "Plot": [
        "A lonely widowed woman, Faye, waits at a campsite by a lake in the Colorado Mountains for Lito, her childhood friend whom she hasn't seen in years, to visit her. As she does not know when he'll be arriving or what he currently looks like, she passes the time with birdwatching, stargazing, and encountering guests on other campsites. These include a polite group of siblings waiting for Faye to move so that they can dig up the coffin of their father so that they can rebury him at a different location, and an engaged lesbian couple who invite Faye to dinner, during which one of the women, Jan, nervously asks her if marriage is worth it.",
        "Lito eventually arrives, and he and Faye spend the day sharing memories, playing music together, and reminiscing about their deceased spouses. Lito takes a photo of Faye, which embarrasses her, as she would rather Lito remember her when as she was when she was young and attractive. At night, after bonding over their shared sense of grief and admittance that they miss their respective partners, the friends sleep together. In the morning, Lito goes to gather flowers for Faye, but becomes overwhelmed with emotion. When Faye goes outside to greet him, he awkwardly thanks her for the invitation, but confesses that he cannot start a romantic relationship with her. Faye is hurt, but understands, and helps him leave.",
        "Faye hikes alone across the landscape and appreciates the view of the stars at night, gradually coming to terms with her turbulent emotions and disappointments. In the morning, she visits Jan and advises her to get married and enjoy her life. Afterwards, she departs the campsite, driving away as the siblings from earlier begin to dig up their father's coffin."
