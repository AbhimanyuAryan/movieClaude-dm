        "Six years after the events of the first film, Jonas Taylor has been involved in fighting environmental crimes while helping Mana One explore the Mariana Trench, where the Megalodon had been found. Following the death of Jonas' wife Suyin Zhang, he has been raising her teenage daughter Meiying alongside her uncle and Suyin's brother Jiuming Zhang. Jiuming acquired his father's company alongside wealthy financier Hillary Driscoll. Mana One has been studying an 80\u00a0ft (24\u00a0m) female Meg called Haiqi, who was discovered as a pup and trained by Jiuming in a reserve in Hainan.",
        "Jonas and Jiuming lead a routine submersible exploration to the Trench. Fellow Meg survivors DJ and Mac observe them from the Mana One. The subs are pursued by Haiqi, who has escaped captivity; the subs dive through the thermocline to escape, where they encounter two much larger Megs, a massive alpha male and a beta male, who mate with Haiqi. Jiuming realizes that Haiqi had been acting strange because it is mating season; she was calling the other Megs to mate. The team discovers an illegal mining operation captained by mercenary Montes, who has a vendetta against Jonas for his imprisonment some time before. Montes' crew was hired by the secretly corrupt Driscoll to use the Mana One's access to the Trench to farm rare-earth minerals that could earn them billions. Montes kills his crew in an explosion to cover up their activities, which causes a rupture in the Trench and grounds the team's ships.",
        "DJ, Mac, and Mana One analyst Jess discover that the rescue pod has been sabotaged, forcing the crew to use exosuits to walk toward Montes' station, with only four of them surviving the journey. Jess reveals herself as a traitor and attempts to remotely kill the four, but they escape in a submersible. As the crew surfaces, they discover that the rupture from earlier has caused several Trench creatures, including the three Megs, lizard-like creatures known as Snappers and a giant octopus to escape to the surface.",
        "Jess is devoured by a Meg when it bites through a window thought to be \"Meg-proof.\" Jonas\u2019 team escapes to a nearby resort, Fun Island. Driscoll, Montes, and the mercenaries arrive at Fun Island to kill Jonas' crew, but are attacked by the Snappers, who devour Driscoll. Jonas' group splits to evacuate the tourists as the Megs and the octopus attack. Jonas kills the beta male Meg before being attacked by Montes. He knocks Montes into the mouth of the alpha Meg to be eaten. Jiuming creates a bomb out of fertilizer and takes over Driscoll's helicopter with Mac.",
        "The octopus takes down the helicopter and Jiuming injures it with his bomb, attracting Haiqi, who kills the octopus. Jonas uses one of the helicopter's rotors to fatally impale the alpha Meg. Haiqi heads towards Jonas, Jiuming, and Mac, but Jiuming uses his training signals to redirect her to a pod of dolphins. As they settle on the beach, Jiuming mentions the possibility that Haiqi is pregnant. The group celebrates their survival."

        "In April 2018, Jason Statham said a sequel to The Meg (2018) would happen if the film did well with the public, saying: \"I think it's like anything in this day and age \u2013 if it makes money, there's obviously an appetite to make more money. And if it doesn't do well, they'll soon sweep it under the carpet--but that's the way Hollywood works.\" In August 2018, Steve Alten said: \"My feeling has always been that this is a billion dollar franchise if it was done right. But to be done right you had to get the shark right, get the cast right, get the tone right. And Warner Bros. have nailed it completely. The producers have nailed it.\" In October 2018, executive producer Catherine Xujun Ying announced a sequel was in the early stages of development.",
        "In March 2019, it was announced that a script for the film was in the works, with screenwriters Dean Georgaris, and Jon and Erich Hoeber returning. In his September 2020 newsletter, Alten confirmed the script, titled Meg 2: The Trench, to be complete, and expressed interest in its \"dark\" tone. In October 2020, Ben Wheatley was announced to direct.",
        "In April 2021, Statham said filming was set to begin in January 2022. Filming commenced as planned at the end of January at the Warner-owned Leavesden Studios outside London, with principal photography starting on February 4, 2022. It continued there until May before switching to outdoor locations, presumably in Asia. While the production was ongoing, Sienna Guillory, Skyler Samuels, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, and Wu Jing were announced as part of the cast.",
        "DNEG, Scanline VFX and Milk VFX provided the visual effects for the sequel (with DNEG also handling the 3D conversion). Pete Bebb and Gavin Round served as production visual effects supervisor and production visual effects producer respectively.",
        "Harry Gregson-Williams composed the score for the sequel, returning from the first film. WaterTower Music released a score album on July 28, in addition to the Bankay Ojo's remix version of Page Kennedy's song \"Chomp.\"",

The film made $12.8 million and $6.7 million in its second and third weekends, finishing in fourth and sixth, respectively.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 27% of 182 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"It isn't without its fun moments, but Meg 2: The Trench suffers from a disjointed story that drifts for too long before finally delivering a few campy thrills.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 40 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 72% overall positive score, with 55% saying they would definitely recommend the film.",
        "In a negative review, RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico gave one out of four stars, and wrote, \"At least until the final half-hour, when he\u2019s finally free to unleash some monstrous chaos, this is one of the dullest films of the year, a plodding, poorly made giant shark movie that inexplicably lets the giant shark take a backseat to an evil underwater drilling operation.\"",
        "Richard Lawson wrote in Vanity Fair: \"Meg 2 is confident in its schlock, piling on one ridiculous conceit after another at such a pace that the audience can\u2019t help but be swept up in it. That is a harder needle to thread than many filmmakers seem to think \u2014 it\u2019s not enough to just be stupid.\"",
        "At the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Actor for Statham and Worst Director for Wheatley."
