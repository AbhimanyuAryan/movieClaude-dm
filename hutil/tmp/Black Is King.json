    "Plot": [
        "On a beach in the spiritual plane, a newborn prince is held by his maternal ancestor while she tells him of his significance and purpose (\"Bigger\"). She performs rituals for the prince and joins other women who are also holding newborns. On the beach, the prince is anointed with white paint by the ancestor, while in a royal palace, he is similarly anointed by an elder. The king gives the young prince a small golden scepter and tells the prince that his ancestors look down on them from the stars and will always be there to guide him (\"Find Your Way Back\").",
        "The young boy is enticed by a monkey to enter a warehouse. A man with a snake asks the boy who he is, but the boy does not answer. The boy stays in the warehouse, adorns himself with gold, and spends his time gambling while being watched by his ancestor and the blue man (\"Don't Jealous Me\"). Outside, a biker gang arrives and encircles the prince. The king comes to save him and is killed by a bike. The prince's uncle tells the prince to flee the village, and he takes over the throne (\"Scar\"). In the spiritual plane, the ancestor leads the king's funeral, while the blue man sits alone (\"Nile\").",
        "The prince dreams of living a carefree life, driving past his ancestor and the blue man. He lives in an extravagant mansion full of expensive clothes, servants, and feasts (\"Mood 4 Eva\"). The prince remembers his uncle banging on a drum, causing him to drop the scepter into the water. A human chess game takes place in the mansion's ground, reminding the prince of how his father taught him the game, which represented the duality of good and evil. In real life, the prince grows up and moves to the city. He now dreams of spending his time partying with girls inside a tricked-out hearse (\"Ja Ara E\"). His driver appears as his uncle, who taunts him with the golden scepter. He stumbles out of the car and wakes up. The prince realizes that pursuing material wealth is unsustainable, and he is encouraged to reclaim his purpose and identity (\"Already\"). His ancestor tells the prince that he will meet himself at the shore, as the blue man walks into the sea (\"Water\"). The prince is reunited with his childhood love (\"Brown Skin Girl\"). The couple gets married (\"Keys to the Kingdom\"), but he is plagued by self-doubt over his purpose.",
        "In another time, a sandstorm arrives (\"Otherside\"). As others are fleeing, the ancestor decides to place her baby in a basket and put it in the river to save the baby. As the basket flows down the river, it reaches a waterfall. In the spiritual plane, the ancestor is reunited with her baby.",
        "The ancestor tells the prince to return to the river, in which he finds the scepter. He is reunited with the elder, who anoints him again with white paint, and he floats upwards into the spiritual plane. The prince reunites with his father and breaks down in front of him. The ancestor reminds the prince of his power, and he assembles an army of women to fight his uncle (\"My Power\"). They chase him out of the kingdom, and the prince reclaims his throne. The ancestor brings the new king and queen their baby (\"Spirit\"), and the baby is anointed."

    "Production": [
        "Beyonc\u00e9 called Black Is King \"my passion project that I have been filming, researching and editing day and night for the past year\". Beyonc\u00e9 invested 100% of her earnings from Disney into making sure that they had the best crew and production for the film. The film's production was top secret, with the public not being aware of the film and some contributors not knowing the scope of the project until the release of the trailer.",
        "In July 2019, after the release of the music video for \"Spirit\", Beyonc\u00e9 wanted to release more visuals for The Lion King: The Gift. At first, she intended to produce a clip for \"Already\", with them shooting in her backyard in The Hamptons. She then intended to shoot one-minute clips for some of the songs and make a 15-minute short film. The scope of the project then widened into creating full-length videos for each song, and her idea later snowballed into a very large production.",
        "When voicing the character of Nala in The Lion King (2019), Beyonc\u00e9 delved into the history of the film and its story. She learnt about Solomon Linda, the South African composer of the song \"Mbube\" who received no credit or royalties from the song being used as \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" in the original The Lion King. This angered Beyonc\u00e9 and she left the studio pledging to create a full-length film that would tell the real story with the help of actual Africans instead of using lions and animation, and show the regalness and beauty of Africans before colonialism and slavery erased their past. \"Mbube\", credited to Linda, is the only original The Lion King song included in Black Is King.",
        "In her cover story for the December 2020 edition of British Vogue, Beyonc\u00e9 explained what inspired her when developing the film, saying:",
        "To research for the film, Beyonc\u00e9 described how she \"spent a lot of time exploring and absorbing the lessons of past generations and the rich history of different African customs\". The trailer shows Beyonc\u00e9 reading from the 1971 book Black Gods and Kings, written by American art-historian Robert Farris Thompson to record the art history of the Yoruba people of southwestern Nigeria. Beyonc\u00e9 collected picture references of African cultural practices for different aspects of the production such as hair and make-up. Director Ibra Ake described Beyonc\u00e9 as \"a scholar\" who wanted to learn about and discuss the meaning and history behind every detail that would be included in the film.",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 had a vision for the story she wanted to tell, and she brought on Blitz Bazawule to assist in writing it, who subsequently produced a storyboard with over 250 frames. Co-director Kwasi Fordjour described the excitement of the early development, saying: \"Your adrenaline starts to rush and it becomes like, 'OK, what are we going to do, how are we going to do it, where do we start?' When you get into the space where you're so interested and enthralled with creating worlds and spaces, it becomes fun, and she makes it fun.\" Beyonc\u00e9 and Fordjour recruited additional directors to direct some of the music videos in the film; Fordjour explained how they chose a diverse group of directors \"who spoke to what we were trying to do\" and \"whose authenticity is the core of their work\". Beyonc\u00e9 held meetings with the additional directors to decide on the general look and feel for each section. Beyonc\u00e9 then held meetings with other members of the crew, focusing on worldbuilding and logistics, as well as to discuss more detailed aspects of the production such as lighting.",
        "The film was written by Beyonc\u00e9, poet Yrsa Daley-Ward, writer Clover Hope and Andrew Morrow. The script also incorporates poetry written by Somali-British poet Warsan Shire.",
        "Bob Iger, Executive Chairman of The Walt Disney Company, handled talks with Beyonc\u00e9 to release the film on Disney+.",
        "The cast and crew for Black Is King were recruited to \"represent diversity and connectivity\", with Beyonc\u00e9 wanting to feature \"raw, new talent\". Folajomi Akinmurele's acting debut was in the \"Spirit\" music video. Beyonc\u00e9 was impressed by his performance and she sought him out, ultimately casting him in the lead role of young Simba. Nigerian dancer and actor Stephen Ojo was also first recruited as a dancer for the \"Spirit\" video. He was then brought back as a choreographer for Black Is King, teaching African dance styles and giving the meaning behind them. His role then evolved into an on-screen acting role as the \"blue man\". Black Is King was his debut film performance. The rest of the main cast were recruited from South Africa. Nyaniso Dzedze explained how the casting team went on a lengthy process in order to find the right person for the role of adult Simba, and \"somehow my face, my image found itself on the table, and I guess the stars aligned and God said yes\". Beyonc\u00e9 handpicked Warren Masemola for the role of Scar, and was also adamant about casting Nandi Madida for the role of Nala.",
        "Special guests were recruited for the film, such as Lupita Nyong'o, Naomi Campbell, Kelly Rowland, Jay-Z, and Beyonc\u00e9's children Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir Carter, as well as some of the artists featured on The Gift, including Yemi Alade, Shatta Wale, Salatiel, Wizkid, and Busiswa. Busiswa told Teen Vogue: \"I can't stop crying because I'm so proud to stand in that place for my people. To be singing in my language of Xhosa \u2014 to stand in that place for my African people, I feel so honored... We were treated with the utmost care and respect and being on that set was the most incredible experience of my whole life.\"",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 wanted to find black synchronized swimmers for the \"Mood 4 Eva\" video and only managed to find a few in the US, including Philicia and Tamar Saunders. Beyonc\u00e9 and her team eventually found the Island Aquatics Synchro team in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and contacted the team's coach Olga Novokshchenova to fly the team to Los Angeles to film the scene. Women were recruited for the \"My Power\" video to represent multi-generational strength, including Aisha Francis (Beyonc\u00e9's former dancer who was eight months pregnant at the time) and Ernestine Shepherd (the world's oldest competitive female bodybuilder at 84 years old). Shepherd described it as \"a wonderful, wonderful experience\" that she felt \"so honored\" to be part of. She explained how Beyonc\u00e9 made her \"feel like a queen\" and thanked her with a warm hug at the end of the shoot, after which Shepherd \"went to the ladies room and shed a few tears\". Members of the Accra-based dance school Dance With Purpose (DWP) Academy were recruited for the \"Already\" video. In 2019, the DWP Academy posted their own choreography for the song after it was first released. This caught the attention of Beyonc\u00e9 and her team reached out to them to invite them to feature in the film.",
        "For the \"Brown Skin Girl\" video specifically, Beyonc\u00e9 explained that it was important for her to represent \"all different shades of brown\". Director Jenn Nkiru picked South Asian model Sheerah Ravindren to be featured in the video, who said that it was \"such a blessing to be in this beautiful art piece that shows the beauty and power of Blackness\" and adding that Beyonc\u00e9 has \"already done so much MORE for representation and empowerment for South Africans than the South African film industries\". Nkiru also asked Selma Nicholls, founder of casting agency Looks Like Me, to cast children for the video. Nicholls called it \"a dream come true, not just for me, not just for those children that were selected, but for all black children\". Nicholls' own daughter was chosen for the film; Nicholls explained that \"it's made my daughter be part of something where five years from when she wanted to look like Elsa and Anna, is singing along to the song \"Brown Skin Girl\"\".",
        "Hundreds of costumes were designed for Black Is King, including 69 for Beyonc\u00e9 herself. Costume designer Zerina Akers described how the aim of the wardrobe was to have a \"global conversation\"; the costumes would enable people of all races to \"recognise and respect the power and beauty of brown skin\", while black people would be inspired \"to research their spiritual heritage and what truly belongs to them\" and be left with the sense \"that the world does belong to them and that they belong in the world\". Akers curated outfits from both global brands and young black designers for the film, saying: \"To be able to give [an emerging talent] the same visibility as a large corporation is invaluable... It's not just about creating a look, it's about how many families can benefit from that look. To see the waves this has created has been a dream.\" Beyonc\u00e9 commented that \"it was important that we worked with African designers\" and that the fashion \"amplified key themes in the film, such as black opulence and excellence\" and \"displayed a range of culture and heritage\". Beyonc\u00e9 added that the costume design utilized color and symbolism in order to \"transition from one emotion to another\".",
        "Akers worked on the wardrobe for approximately three months. She started by going into fabric stores, swatching pieces that spoke to her as she listened to the music of The Gift. She started to create custom looks with local designers, while her counterpart Rogelio F. Burgos, started to collect runway looks. As the project grew, she hired a team of seven people to work on the film. The process became a \"travelling circus\", according to Akers; a constant stream of packages were arriving to set, including some straight off the runway, and they were constantly making new costumes and calling designers at midnight with ideas.",
        "Akers spoke about how she \"wanted to reference different cultures, traditions and tribes, but to have the freedom to create fantasy, for people to be able to escape into a new world\". This included dancers wearing Kanaga masks in the \"Find Your Way Back\" video, with the sparkly looks being inspired by constellations; this is a reference to the Dogon people's astrological belief system and advanced astronomical expertise. The fashion in the \"My Power\" video was designed according to the colors of the Seven African Powers, with each singer representing a different orisha. Actors in the film were dressed with headpieces and belts made from cowrie shells, an allusion to when the shells were treated as currency in Africa. One look in the \"Already\" video was a 5:31 J\u00e9r\u00f4me blue Nigerian lace trench dress with an accompanying Nigerian gele, inspired by the fashion of matriarchal women at Nigerian weddings. A Burberry cowprint top and skirt from the \"Already\" video were inspired by the Xhosa and Zulu people of South Africa, who use the hide of Nguni cattle in their shields. Akers collaborated with American fashion designer Natalia Fedner on a gold chain headpiece covered in gold earrings of various styles and sizes for \"Already\", representing how gold jewelry connects generations of black women and the African diaspora. In one scene, Beyonc\u00e9 wears chokers fused together as a reference to Ndebele neck rings. The outfits of Beyonc\u00e9 and an entourage of women in the \"Mood 4 Eva\" sequence was an allusion to the Dahomey Amazons, an all-female military regiment from the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin.",
        "Hairstylist Neal Farinah recalled Beyonc\u00e9 saying to him one Tuesday night: \"Hey, I want to talk to you. I've been saving this baby for a moment now, and I want to do it.\" After asking her what the project is, Beyonc\u00e9 replied: \"I want to do a movie and I want you to do this masterpiece with me.\" She showed him pages of picture references of traditional African hairstyles that she had spent time collecting, and they remained there until almost 4 am discussing the hairstyles. Beyonc\u00e9 wanted the hair completed by Friday, so Farinah asked his manager to look on social media for the best black hairstylists and send them to his salon in the morning. Farinah continued to research about different hairstyles and cultures, and the team spent over 16 hours a day for 6 days to create more than 40 wigs.",
        "Farinah stated that the aim of the hairstyling was to \"educate people about Blackness and Black hair, Black trends, how amazing it is and the story behind it, the history behind these cultures\", as \"Black women's hair and Black trends have been put down for so many years\" and these styles were \"not just hair\" but had deep meanings behind them. Farinah added that Black Is King was a great moment to \"share the piece of the pie with other Black hairstylists who don't have this platform to show their creativity and their work\".",
        "The hairstyles in Black Is King were inspired by various traditional African hairstyles, with Farinah and Beyonc\u00e9 striving to offer insight into African culture with every style. One of Beyonc\u00e9's hairstyles in \"Already\" was inspired by the horned heads and lip plates of the Dinka and Mursi peoples, who wear them as symbols of prestige and honour. Another of the hairstyles in the same video used Bantu knots to pay respect to the Zulu people, with an ankh symbol in the center to symbolize life as in ancient Egyptian culture. Beyonc\u00e9's braid crown in \"Brown Skin Girl\" was inspired by the Mangbetu people of the Eastern Congo, whose Lipombo skull elongation technique represented royalty and status. In the same video, another hairstyle known as Orisha Bunmi can be seen, which is a Nigerian style worn for special events. One scene shows women covering their hair in red clay, which is a reference to the Himba people of Namibia and Angola. A 30-foot braided wig that can be seen in \"Water\" was inspired by the women of Chad. Beyonc\u00e9 conceived the idea for the wig, and hairstylist Kim Kimble worked with six braiders for three days to make it.",
        "There were 11 choreographers who worked on Black Is King. Stephen Ojo and Caleb Bonney of dance group AVO (Africa's Very Own) Boyz were unexpectedly contacted by choreographer JaQuel Knight and asked to fly out to Los Angeles the following day. They showed Knight choreography to \"Already\" that they had made a few days prior for a class they were teaching. They then taught Beyonc\u00e9 the choreography, as well as several other dances from throughout Africa, such as the Gbese, Poco and Kpakujemu from Nigeria, the C'est Moi from Ivory Coast, and the network from Ghana. Ojo said that his aim for the choreography \"was to make sure the moves we were bringing out were properly represented and danced in the right way. I wanted to make sure Africa was being represented properly and not diluted.\" Ojo commented on his experience working with Beyonc\u00e9, saying: \"She was a very good student. Paying homage to the originators, paying respect to our culture\u2014some people might not care. But she was very receptive. She was being respectful the whole time, listening. And every move was clean, sharp, crisp.\" Lauren Michele Jackson of The New Yorker noted the wide array of African dance styles in Black Is King, writing that the film is a tribute to \"the manifold ways in which a body can move: legwork, footwork, shaku shaku, zanku, twerk, wine, gbese, thrust, grind, shake\".",
        "For the \"Mood 4 Eva\" video, Beyonc\u00e9 and Knight had a vision of a Busby Berkeley-inspired synchronized swimming routine, with swimmers creating formations such as a dolphin chain circle through which Beyonc\u00e9 would swim. Knight worked with Mary Jeanette Ramsey, executive director of Aqualillies, to choreograph the routine. French-Sudanese choreographer Kany Diabat\u00e9 and American choreographer Ebony Williams choreographed the \"My Power\" video; Diabat\u00e9 commented on her work on the film: \"When you realize your wildest dream and tell the world you just CHOREOGRAPHED the biggest artist in this planet earth and the woman you been inspired for SO MANY YEARS!!!\" A scene where black men in suits jumping up and down in unison is a reference to the adumu Maasai jumping dance of Kenya and Tanzania, a ceremony in which men in a circle compete for who can jump the highest with a straight posture.",
        "Various pieces of art were added to the sets in Black Is King. For the \"Mood 4 Eva\" sequence, Beyonc\u00e9 borrowed some of her mother Tina Knowles-Lawson's art pieces. In the mansion used for the video, a painting by Derrick Adams was placed on the walls, as well as sculptures by Woodrow Nash, whose work fuses Benin art with Art Nouveau. Ugo Rondinone's sun sculptures, which symbolize rebirth and renewal, were featured in the \"Already\" video in order to reflect the film's motif of the 'circle of life'. The circle motif is also reflected by the inclusion of Lee Broom's Hanging Hoop Chair. African-American Flag was featured in the film; the piece was created by David Hammons in 1990 to represent the marginalization of African-American artists and is seen as a symbol of black liberation. A wall of recycled containers was used in the \"Water\" video as a reference to Ghanaian installation artist Serge Attukwei Clottey as well as to environmentalism.",
        "Statues that were on the \"Keys to the Kingdom\" set, including one of a black woman with a child wrapped on her back, were intended to inspire young black children, with director Ibra Ake saying: \"Just seeing that as a black man, coming from America, I'm like, yeah this is opposite of what I have to inspire me growing up. You just don't get to see representation like that or black people honored in that way.\"  Director Jenn Nkiru explained how on the set of the \"Brown Skin Girl\" video, there was \"a huge presence of life\", specifically a lot of flowers and plants, representing the themes of growth and nurturing. The \"Ja Are E\" set consisted of a hearse converted into a party vehicle with neon lights, symbolizing the prince's \"reckless effervescence\", according to director Blitz Bazawule.",
        "The church featured in the \"Nile\" and \"My Power\" videos was painted fully in white by a team of over 100 people working for 38 hours straight, to reflect the use of white as a symbol of mourning in certain cultures. According to production designer Hannah Beachler, the solemn nature of the funeral in \"Nile\" and the celebratory nature of \"My Power\" not only reflects the protagonist's journey, but also symbolizes Black Is King's message of \"mourning what we were in order to celebrate what we are\". The Bese Saka adinkra symbol was placed on the floor of the church to signify power, abundance and unity. 8-foot tall, 10-foot wide and 3-foot deep arches covered in a black-and-white print were added to the set. The arches were inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973 film The Holy Mountain, bringing \"the piece into an abstract and modern space\". According to director of photography Santiago Gonzalez, the set represented \"a temple dedicated to the power of femininity, sisterhood and motherhood\".",
        "Principal photography for Black Is King took place in the latter half of 2019 for four to six months. The filming was carried out across six countries on three continents, with Beyonc\u00e9 wanting to include both the African continent and diaspora. Beyonc\u00e9 described the filming as \"absolutely an adventure\", stating: \"I performed in the belly of sand dunes and I floated in the middle of the ocean. I landed on mountains to swim in waterfalls.\"",
        "The Nigerian chapter was led by director Ibra Ake, with Dafe Obro and Meji Alabi as co-directors. Filming for the \"Keys to the Kingdom\" video took place at the National Arts Theatre in Lagos, as Ake wanted to show a vision of Africa that isn't fantastical, but is grounded in a real location yet still amazing and impressive. In South Africa, the Shakaland Zulu Village in KwaZulu-Natal and the Ndebele church in Mapoch were the sets for the royal family's village and the wedding scene, respectively. Ponte City Apartments in Johannesburg was chosen as the location for the king's ascension to heaven, as the building used to be a bastion of apartheid in South Africa, and so the film upends that symbol and shows the prince floating out of it.",
        "The Ghanaian chapter was led by director Joshua Kissi. Filming took place in the Eastern Region and Greater Accra Region, with the team wanting to include locations that were underrepresented in depictions of Ghana, such as Shatta Wale's hometown of Nima. Producer Sharifah Issaka noted that Beyonc\u00e9 used local Ghanaian talent for the production and paid them well, unlike most foreign crews when filming in Ghana, making Black Is King \"a model for other brands that might be interested in creating content or engaging with the continent\" to encourage them to provide opportunities to local talent. Issaka also noted that Black Is King is \"a testament to the talent and capability of Black artists\u2014 who when given the chance, can create phenomenal work. I think Beyonc\u00e9 understands that these people are here. People take inspiration from Africa all the time, but hiring people and providing local people on the ground with opportunities is a whole other thing. Inspiration is not going to fill my bank account, show me the money.\"",
        "In New York, filming took place in the former plantation Sylvester Manor, the art gallery Guild Hall of East Hampton and Pier59 Studios. Filming also took place in Apple Valley in California and Havasu Falls in the Grand Canyon; Black Is King was the first production to be filmed at Havasu Falls, with the Havasupai people granting special permission to Beyonc\u00e9. Emmanuel Adjei and Beyonc\u00e9 were the directors of the \"Don't Jealous Me\" and \"Otherside\" sections.",
        "\"Bigger\" and \"Find Your Way Back\" were directed by Beyonc\u00e9 alone, and were filmed in Arroyo Burro Beach and Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, California. Director of photography Santiago Gonzalez at first planned to film \"Find Your Way Back\" entirely on drones, however Beyonc\u00e9's team arrived to set with an Arri Alexa Mini package, which Gonzalez then used to shoot with in between drone setups. The crew scouted locations of sand dunes for a full day to look for interesting shapes in the landscape, such as deep valleys or high ridges that would play well with the drone. Some scenes in the video were filmed in a light setting, such as the sand dunes, and others were filmed in a dark setting, such as a comet landing and Beyonc\u00e9 laying down on a bed of stars; these two types of scenes were intended to represent a journey and a duality. The sequins and crystals in the fashion were lit so that they could sparkle and glimmer to resemble stars. One scene was framed with a profile of Beyonc\u00e9 and her dancers behind her to pay homage to the cover art of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew.",
        "The \"Mood 4 Eva\" segment was filmed in the Beverly House over two days in September 2019, with Beyonc\u00e9 and Dikayl Rimmasch as directors. There were 20 large setups around the mansion and the film crew totaled around 40 people in grip, electric and camera. The concept for the segment was to show the characters living a carefree lifestyle with a dreamscape reminiscent of old Hollywood. In order to give the video a vintage look, director of photography Santiago Gonzalez employed Kowa Cine Prominar lenses \u2013 spherical lenses built in the 1960s \u2013 providing a warmer flare, good contrast and a saturation that imparts brightness and opulence. Gonzalez also used a diffusion filter to bloom the highlights and make the images slightly softer, and made the window light bloom so that they conveyed a dream-like quality to the video. Other scenes in the segment were inspired by Eddie Murphy's Coming to America and Hype Williams' Belly. The old Hollywood dreamscape culminated in a Busby Berkeley-style aqua-musical fantasy with a synchronized swimming routine inspired by the 1944 Esther Williams film Bathing Beauty. The swimmers recalled seeing different aspects of Beyonc\u00e9 on set, one being \"Beyonc\u00e9 the businesswoman, fearless in bringing her vision to life\" who \"never hesitated getting wet, literally, as many times as needed to get the perfect shot\", and the other being \"Beyonc\u00e9 the mother, taking time to include her family in the entire process\" and \"frequently checking in with the younger girls to make sure they remained comfortable in the cool water\". Nicole Chin Sue, one of the synchronised swimmers in the video, recalled:",
        "The \"Nile\" and \"My Power\" videos were filmed in November 2019 at the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles, with Beyonc\u00e9 as director. Co-director Julian Klincewicz operated a 1980s Ikegani Tsushinki broadcast camera. Director of photography Santiago Gonzalez employed Arri Ultra-Wide 8mm Prime lenses and used low sweeping angles for the \"My Power\" video to make the columns on set feel \"huge\" and \"alive\" and to add speed to the camera movement, amplifying the dynamism of the choreography. Beyonc\u00e9 specified that she did not want to be the point of focus for any shots that included the other artists featured in the video, and instead asked to be on the edge of the frame or integrated into a group. Gonzalez consequently kept the lighting bright with less of a key light, highlighting the women's natural beauty.",
        "The \"Brown Skin Girl\" segment was mainly filmed in London, as well as in Nigeria and Los Angeles. Director Jenn Nkiru chose to primarily feature South London, including her hometown of Peckham, due to its large black and South Asian communities. The video for \"Scar\" was directed by Pierre Debusschere and filmed on December 15, 2019 in the Sahara nature reserve in Lommel, Belgium. Debusschere recalled sometimes working 23 hours a day on the film, with the \"Scar\" scene being filmed at 5 am and -2\u00a0\u00b0C weather. Debusschere described how he had to try keep up with Beyonc\u00e9 and praised her as \"a powerful, inspiring woman\" who excels in her various roles, saying: \"It's in the way she understands sets,... but also in the way she picks up the choreography and switches between the business side and the artistic side. It's her company, her thing, her money, and her vision that make this project.\"",
        "Post-production took place from December 2019 with Emmanuel Adjei supervising the visual-effects. Multiple versions of scenes were shot, and Beyonc\u00e9 held discussions with the other directors on the strengths of each shot and to decide which edit worked best. At the beginning of the COVID\u201119 pandemic, a full re-edit of the film was carried out in order to make the story as poignant as possible. The editing process was challenging, as multiple post-production companies were working on the film all remotely. Fordjour noted how the George Floyd protests began as the film was in post-production, describing it as \"divine intervention\" and adding: \"Being able to do something that was a love letter to fellow women and men, and our culture, in a time when we need a pick-me-up, that is something that I will never forget.\"",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 and Derek Dixie acted as music directors, while MeLo-X, Derek Dixie, and James William Blades contributed to the score; MeLo-X described working on the film on Twitter, writing: \"Truly an amazing and eye opening journey. @Beyonce always pushes for greatness. This is nothing less\"."
