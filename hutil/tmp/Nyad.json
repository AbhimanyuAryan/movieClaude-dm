    "Plot": [
        "In 2010, sixty-year-old Diana Nyad resolves to accomplish the one thing that has eluded her\u2014a 110-mile nonstop swim from Cuba to Florida, which she had unsuccessfully attempted thirty years prior. She appoints her best friend and former partner, Bonnie Stoll, to train her. Despite public skepticism because of her age, Diana relocates to Key West with Bonnie for her training and hires navigator John Bartlett to accompany her on her swim. In lieu of a shark cage, Diana opts to swim with a Shark Shield, a shark repellant electronic device.",
        "In August 2011, Diana makes her first attempt at swimming the Florida Straits since 1978. However, unfavorable ocean currents pushing her off course force her to quit early. On her second attempt a month later, she gets stung by box jellyfish. The lead medic jumps in to save her, but he is also ensnared by the jellyfish and has to be rescued. A shot is administered to Diana for the venom, but she insists on continuing to swim with her injury. After some initial resistance, Bonnie and John oblige her, but Diana gets stung again and briefly loses consciousness. She is resuscitated on the boat.",
        "Diana recovers in a hospital, where Bonnie expresses her worry to Diana about the severity of the dangers and warns her she is letting her personal dream overtake the safety of the boat crew. Diana pleads for another try and consults with a box jellyfish expert, who gives her a specially designed protective suit. Diana's swims and training are interspersed with flashbacks that show her upbringing and her sexual abuse at the hands of her childhood swimming coach, Jack Nelson.",
        "In August 2012, Diana makes another attempt, despite warnings from John about bad weather conditions. A thunderstorm breaks out during Diana's swim and John's boat starts to flood. Bonnie calls for Diana to abort the mission despite Diana's pleas to keep going. Back on land, Diana refuses to admit defeat and plans for another try, prompting a fight between her and Bonnie. Bonnie calls out Diana's self-centeredness and laments how she has put aside her own dreams just to support Diana, before quitting as trainer.",
        "Some time later, Diana calls John and apologizes for her behavior. John accepts the apology but admits he can't do another run because of more pressing concerns, including financial stability. Diana visits Bonnie and the two reconcile. Bonnie informs Diana that Nelson passed away, and the news compels Diana to reflect on her trauma. Bonnie later decides to train Diana again after realizing the closeness of their bond. John also returns as navigator; he discloses to Bonnie that he is in ill health and wants one last opportunity to see what Diana can do.",
        "Diana begins her fifth attempt on August 31, 2013; this time she is helped by more favorable currents. Danger arises when a shark approaches and the Shark Shield is not properly functioning. Assistants from the boat's crew jump in the water in time to ward off the shark, which swims away. Hours later, Diana's body is showing signs of exhaustion. She has hallucinatory visions of the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz and the Taj Mahal. To help motivate her, Bonnie jumps into the water and implores Diana to give it one last push. When the coastline of Key West is in sight, the crew excitedly informs Diana that they are getting closer.",
        "On September 2, Diana makes it to the shore of Key West, where hordes of spectators and fans are gathered to watch. She emerges from the water and gradually ascends onto the beach, prompting celebrations from the crowd. Asked by the press to speak, Diana says she wants to say three things: \"One, never, ever give up. Two, you're never too old to chase your dreams. And three, it may look like a solitary sport\u2026but it takes a team.\""

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 158 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Nyad is an uplifting sports biopic strictly on the merits of its story, but it's the outstanding performances from Annette Bening and Jodie Foster that really keep this picture afloat.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Richard Roeper called the film a \"rousing biopic\" and stated: \"When Bening and Foster are onscreen together, it\u2019s movie magic. They don\u2019t just have chemistry; they\u2019re chemistry professors.\" Siddhant Adlakha of Mashable wrote, \"It's a movie in which age is both obstacle and strength, and it allows Bening and Foster to play their ages gracefully, as actresses in their sixties. Whatever it struggles to say about bravery in the face of wounds from decades past, it manages to say tenfold about the way its characters choose to live now. Nyad builds to exuberant emotional crescendos that feel straight out of the schmaltzy Hollywood biopic playbook, but these scenes transcend clich\u00e9 thanks to the emotionally resonant performances at their core.\" He critiqued the handling of the abuse plot line as \"narratively misplaced\", but said \"thanks to [the film's] unyielding focus on physical strain and suffering \u2014 it's the aquatic Passion of the Christ \u2014 it maintains enough stakes and sporadic intensity to get by\". Writing for The New York Times, Amy Nicholson said Bening and Foster's scenes together \"capture decades of camaraderie in effortless shorthand\".",
        "Writing for Vulture, Alison Willmore praised how the film eschews biopic conventions of making the protagonist likable, as well as Bening's commitment to the role and physical transformation. She said, \"Despite that dedication, there\u2019s a hollowness to the way the film characterizes its protagonist, which means Bening\u2019s performance never fully resonates\", adding \"we never see any of that or much of what [Diana's] life is like outside of training at all\". Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com wrote, \"There's a thornier, messier, much more provocative story to be told here, so it's frustrating the filmmakers opt for easy inspiration instead.\" She noted how the film curiously skips over Nyad's history of embellishment, but praised the acting in particular, saying \"it\u2019s a joy to watch Foster dig into this kind of amusing and meaty role once more. Bonnie is the one person who will call Diana out on her obnoxious behavior\u2014at least until Rhys Ifans arrives later as the no-nonsense captain of the boat that cruises alongside Diana during troubled try after try.\" Lemire concluded Nyad \"might not be the greatest film about\u2026achievement, but it\u2019s sufficiently entertaining\".",
        "Rex Reed called it \"a movie of uncommon exhilaration\" that \"resonates long after the final frame,\" and highly praised the performances of Bening and Foster. Peter Travers said Bening's performance is \"body-and-soul acting at its peak\", and referred to Foster as \"an exuberant blast\", continuing: \"Their teamwork is a thing of beauty.\" Leonard Maltin named Nyad as one of his favorite films of 2023: \"Nyad is a compelling biopic that could have been bland, or didactic, or dull. Instead, in the hands of documentary filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, with a smart script by Julia Cox, it soars. One of this year's great pleasures was watching Annette Bening and Jodie Foster together, inhabiting their characters so completely that it didn't seem like acting at all. I would also nominate Rhys Ifans for Best Supporting Actor.\""
