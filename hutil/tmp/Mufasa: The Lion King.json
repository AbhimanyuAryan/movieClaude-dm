        "In September 2020, it was announced that a follow-up film to the live-action-styled photorealistic CGI 2019 remake of The Lion King (1994) was in development, with Barry Jenkins attached to direct. Reports indicated that the project would have a story centered on Mufasa during his formative years, with additional scenes focusing on the events after the first film; comparing the movie to a similar structure as The Godfather Part II (1974). The film will not be a remake of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), the direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film. By this point, Jeff Nathanson, the previous installment's screenwriter, had completed a draft of the script. The film was officially announced, with the title of Mufasa: The Lion King at the 2022 D23 Expo.",
        "On December 13, 2023, the Hollywood Handle reported that the film's plot would involve Rafiki telling the story of Mufasa to his granddaughter, Kiara, marking the character's first on-screen appearance in an animated feature film since The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.",
        "In August 2021, Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. were cast as the voices of young Mufasa and Scar, respectively. By September 2022, it was revealed that Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani will reprise their roles as Pumbaa, Timon, and Rafiki, respectively. During an interview with Fandango in April 2023 about his film Chevalier (2022), Harrison Jr. confirmed that the film will explore Scar's backstory, portraying him in a \"hilarious and very, very spicy\" way and expressing interest in how the young and sweet Scar's relationship with his brother Mufasa evolves throughout the film.",
        "In September 2022, at D23, the first footage was played exclusively to attendees, thus revealing that production had been underway. Moving Picture Company is returning to provide the visual effects. In July 2023, production on the film slowed down due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike."
