The sequel to Sing (2016), it was written and directed by Garth Jennings, co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet, and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy. The story is set after the events of the previous film with Buster Moon and his group putting on a show in Redshore City while working to impress an entertainment mogul and enlist a reclusive rock star to perform with the group.\nThe film stars an ensemble voice cast consisting of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Taron Egerton, Tori Kelly, Nick Kroll, Jennings, Peter Serafinowicz, Jennifer Saunders, and Nick Offerman, reprising their roles from the first film. The sequel also features new characters voiced by Bobby Cannavale, Bono, Halsey, Pharrell Williams, Chelsea Peretti, Letitia Wright, and Eric Andr\u00e9. Like the first film, Sing 2 features songs from many artists, most of which are performed diegetically.\nSing 2 made its world premiere at the AFI Fest on November 14, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 22, 2021. The film was met with generally positive reviews and grossed over $408\u00a0million worldwide against a production budget of $85\u00a0million, becoming the highest-grossing animated film of 2021 and the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2021. A sequel is in development.\n\n\nPlot\nSometime after the events of the first film, Buster Moon is thriving with his newly rebuilt theater; Johnny, Meena, Rosita, Gunter, and Miss Crawly work as his cast and crew, while Ash performs as a soloist at a rock club. Buster's show fails to impress Crystal Entertainment's talent scout dog Suki Lane, who tells Buster he would not make it in nearby Redshore City. Encouraged by Nana Noodleman, Buster and the crew reunite with Ash and head off to the city to make an impression.\nThey are denied entry into Crystal Entertainment, but sneak in for an audition with entertainment mogul wolf Jimmy Crystal. As Jimmy is uninterested in Buster's original show pitch, Gunter suggests a space-themed sci-fi musical that features songs from Clay Calloway, a legendary rock star lion who disappeared after his wife Ruby died 15 years ago. Intrigued, and assuming Clay will be a part of the show, Jimmy greenlights it and lets Buster and his friends stay at his hotel during production.\nMiss Crawly finds where Clay lives and goes to visit him, but he scares her away with a paintball gun. During a rehearsal, Rosita develops a fear of heights, after discovering she needs to make a high jump and prompting Jimmy to insist his daughter Porsha play her part instead. Buster reluctantly gives Rosita a minor role. Top choreographer monkey Klaus Kickenklober is hired to teach Johnny to dance, but is unnecessarily harsh, causing Johnny to struggle. Johnny later comes across a street dancer lynx named Nooshy, who takes over as his teacher. Meena is cast in a romantic scene with Darius, an egocentric actor yak, but is unable to act the part convincingly, having never been in love before. She later meets and falls in love with an ice cream vendor elephant named Alfonso. Jimmy eventually finds out that Buster never contacted Clay about the show, and threatens to harm Buster if he does not deliver.\nAsh and Buster visit Clay to convince him to be in the show. He refuses at first, finding it too emotionally painful to perform after his wife's death, but Ash changes his mind. Back at the theater, Buster asks Porsha to switch roles with Rosita, as Porsha's acting skills are poor. Porsha misinterprets this as Buster firing her and runs off. After news of the \"firing\" is broadcast on television, an outraged Jimmy nearly drops Buster off the roof of the hotel, before locking him in a closet. Suki frees Buster and warns him to leave Redshore City before Jimmy can kill him. Ash arrives at the hotel room with the crew and Clay, who advises Buster not to run and hide as he did. After overhearing Jimmy insult him and his crew on television, Buster decides to put on the show that night behind Jimmy's back. Porsha rejoins the show, Johnny summons his father's gang to keep Jimmy and his bodyguards at bay, and Rosita arranges for her husband Norman and their children to distract hotel security.\nDuring the show, a jealous Klaus takes the place of Johnny's performance partner to undermine his number, but Johnny defeats Klaus with encouragement from Nooshy and the other dancers, finally earning Klaus' respect. Porsha performs a high energy song and dance number in the minor role originally given to Rosita, standing up to her enraged father. Meena visualizes Darius as Alfonso, and successfully performs a romantic duet with him. In a last attempt to stop the show, Jimmy drops Buster off a high catwalk, which forces Rosita to overcome her fear of heights and make the jump to rescue Buster. When the time comes for Clay to take the stage, he claims that he is not ready yet. Ash leads the crowd in a rendition of one of Clay's songs, giving him the courage to perform. After the curtain call, Jimmy tries to take credit for the successful show, but instead Suki has him arrested by the police.\nSome time later, Buster and the crew set out to return to Calatonia, with Nooshy, Porsha, and Clay joining them. Suki stops them, and tells them that a major theater called The Majestic wants to put on their show. As they put on their first official performance, Buster watches from the VIP section.\n\nVoice cast\nMatthew McConaughey as Buster Moon, a koala who owns the New Moon Theater\nReese Witherspoon as Rosita, a pig and mother of 25 piglets who recently realized her singing dreams\nScarlett Johansson as Ash, a porcupine punk rock guitarist\nTaron Egerton as Johnny, Big Daddy's son, a teenage gorilla singer and pianist\nBobby Cannavale as Jimmy Crystal, a white wolf and media owner who owns Crystal Entertainment\nTori Kelly as Meena, a slightly shy teenage elephant with an exquisite singing voice\nNick Kroll as Gunter, a passionate dancing pig and Rosita's dance partner\nPharrell Williams as Alfonso, an elephant and ice cream vendor who becomes Meena's love interest\nHalsey as Porsha Crystal, Jimmy's daughter who is a talented singer\nChelsea Peretti as Suki Lane, Jimmy's haughty Saluki assistant and talent scout\nLetitia Wright as Nooshy, a lynx street dancer who becomes Johnny's dance instructor\nEric Andr\u00e9 as Darius, an egocentric yak who plays Meena's love interest in the show\nAdam Buxton as Klaus Kickenklober, a harsh and prideful proboscis monkey dance instructor\nGarth Jennings as Miss Crawly, an elderly iguana with a glass eye who works as Buster's assistant\nJennings also voices the bus terminal, and the airbag from a rental car\nPeter Serafinowicz as Big Daddy, a mobster gorilla and Johnny's father who is now on work release\nJennifer Saunders as Nana Noodleman, a sheep and former singing star\nNick Offerman as Norman, a pig and Rosita's husband\nBono as Clay Calloway, a white-maned aged lion who was once a rock star legend until his wife Ruby died [8]\nIn addition, Julia Davis voices Linda le Bon, a horse and host of a talk show, while Spike Jonze has an uncredited voice role as Jerry, a cat who is Jimmy's personal assistant.[9]\nAmongst the voices of Rosita and Norman's piglets is Matthew McConaughey's daughter, Vida Alves McConaughey, who voices the piglet that goes splashing in chocolate.[10] Director Jennings' wife, Louise Jennings, voices a dog worker making Meena's costume for the show, while the couple's four children, Asa, Caspar, Leo and Oscar Jennings, are among the piglet voices.\nAs with the first film, Jennings' filmmaker friends Wes Anderson, Chris Renaud, and Edgar Wright all have cameos in the film, with Anderson as a tarsier night cleaner,[11] Renaud as Linda Le Bon's show announcer, and Wright voicing a dog cop and a pig chauffeur.[12] Scott Mosier, director of The Grinch and the short film Eddie's Life Coach, voices Mason, a walrus worker making the sets for the show.\n\nProduction\nWriter and director Garth Jennings\nOn January 25, 2017, Universal Pictures and Illumination announced a sequel to its 2016 animated film Sing was in development.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Second verse, same as the first: For audiences that enjoyed the first installment, Sing 2 should prove another endearing diversion.\"[59] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[60] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale (the first Illumination film to receive this grade), while PostTrak reported 91% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 78% saying they would definitely recommend it.[31]\nJustin Lowe, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, praised the musical set of the film, calling the \"ragtag cast that Buster had brought for an amateur cast, had blossomed into a full-fledged company of professional performers\".[61] Peter Debruge, of Variety, also gave a positive review, saying the film is \"an elaborate machinery of joy, and it's easier to appreciate how every choice seems designed to put a smile on people's faces\".[62]\nHowever, a few reviewers were disappointed by the film. Emily Clark of Plugged In praised the film's inspiring and emotional elements, but took issue with the fact that Meena \"clearly tells Buster she\u2019s not OK kissing someone on stage, and he sort of dismisses her...The whole affair made me a bit queasy thinking about how many a young starlet has received her first smooch from a total stranger at the behest of adult directors and producers.\"[63] Mark Kermode, who had given the first film a positive review, stated that Sing 2 overused its flashier technical effects and lacked the \"homemade charm\" that characterized the first film.[64]\n\nAccolades\n\nAccolades received by Sing 2\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\nNovember 17, 2021\n\nBest Music Supervisor(s) \u2013 Film\n\nMike KnoblochRachel Levy\n\nNominated\n\n[65]\n\n\nBest Original Song \u2013 Animated Film\n\nYour Song Saved My Life \u2013 U2 (Bono, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jr. and David Evans)\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Soundtrack Album\n\nSing 2 \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\nNominated\n\n\nNAACP Image Awards\n\nFebruary 26, 2022\n\nOutstanding Animated Motion Picture\n\nSing 2\n\nNominated\n\n[66]\n\n\nOutstanding Character Voice-Over Performance \u2013 Motion Picture\n\nLetitia Wright\n\nWon\n\n\nEric Andr\u00e9\n\nNominated\n\n\nACE Eddie Awards\n\nMarch 5, 2022\n\nBest Edited Animated Feature Film\n\nGregory Perler\n\nNominated\n\n[67]\n\n\nArt Directors Guild Awards\n\nMarch 5, 2022\n\nExcellence in Production Design for an Animated Film\n\nOlivier Adam\n\nNominated\n\n[68]\n\n\nVisual Effects Society Awards\n\nMarch 8, 2022\n\nOutstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Feature\n\nPatrick Delage, Nathalie Vancauwenberghe, Christophe Lourdelet, Boris Jacq\n\nNominated\n\n[69]\n\n\nOutstanding Created Environment in an Animated Feature\n\nLudovic Rami\u00e8re, Th\u00e9o Rivoalen, Henri Deruer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mainil (for Crystal Theater)\n\nNominated\n\n\nOutstanding Effects Simulations in an Animated Feature\n\nRichard Adenot, Guillaume Gay, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Valz-Gris, Antoine Br\u00e9mont\n\nNominated\n\n\nAnnie Awards\n\nMarch 12, 2022\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nSing 2\n\nNominated\n\n[70]\n\n\nProducers Guild of America Awards\n\nMarch 19, 2022\n\nOutstanding Producer of Animated Theatrical Motion Pictures\n\nChris Meledandri and Janet Healy\n\nNominated\n\n[71]\n\n\nAmerican Cinema Editors Awards\n\nMarch 5, 2022\n\nBest Edited Animated Feature Film\n\nGregory Perler\n\nNominated\n\n[67]\n\n\nNickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\n\nApril 9, 2022\n\nFavorite Animated Movie\n\nSing 2\n\nNominated\n\n[72]\n\n\nFavorite Voice from an Animated Movie\n\nScarlett Johansson as Ash\n\nWon\n\n\nReese Witherspoon as Rosita\n\nNominated\n\nSequel\nIn April 2023, Meledandri confirmed a third Sing film is in development.[73]\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ Exclusively in a Christmas commercial from Comcast.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"'Migration' Trailer Previews Illumination's Avian Misadventure\".
