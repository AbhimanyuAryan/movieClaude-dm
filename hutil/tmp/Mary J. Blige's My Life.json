Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Ordona praised the film for \"its fan testimonials of the album\u2019s impact and Blige\u2019s emotional recollections of the songs' roots.\" Robert Daniels of RogerEbert.com described the film as \"fortuitously (providing) a love letter to Blige\u2019s fans that teems with the same truthful message as the singer's best music\". In a review for Variety, Andrew Barker wrote that \"as a fan-centric retrospective, (the film) hits plenty of the right notes; but as a chance to more thoroughly explore a complicated, still-influential landmark, it never digs quite deeply enough.\""
