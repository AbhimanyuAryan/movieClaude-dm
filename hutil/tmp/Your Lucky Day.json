The film stars Angus Cloud (posthumously), Elliot Knight, Jessica Garza, Sterling Beaumon, Mousa Hussein Kraish, Jason Wiles, Sebastian Sozzi, Spencer Garrett and Jason O'Mara. The film was released theatrically by Well Go USA Entertainment on November 10, 2023.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nLate at night, a group of strangers find themselves in a little corner convenience store. Amir, behind the counter, owns the store with his brother. Sterling huddles over a magazine, looking extremely sketchy. Ana (Jessica Garza), hugely pregnant and still in her waitress uniform, stands by the ice cream freezer with her boyfriend Abraham (Elliot Knight) in a suit and tie from his gig playing piano at a mall. An off-duty security guard wanders the aisle. And finally, there's Mr. Laird at the counter. We overhear all of these people having conversations. Everyone is talking about money. Mr. Laird balks at the price of what he's buying, treating Amir disrespectfully before proclaiming, \"I love small businesses.\" He then buys a lottery ticket and promptly wins $156 million. Laird might be a cocky jerk, but he is also stupid because he makes an excited scene about how much money he just won. Everyone is visibly irritated. They all could use that money. Why did it have to be him?\nSterling is the only one who acts on the collective irritation. He demands Laird hand over the ticket. The confrontation intensifies. Amir loses control of his store. Ana and Abraham huddle over by the ice cream freezer. The security guard decides to be a hero. Shots are fired. They won't be the last. From this moment forward, the fate of everyone in the store is sealed. They are no longer individuals; they are a collective embroiled in a situation spiraling out of control. Nothing unfolds according to plan. Sterling suddenly finds himself a hostage-taker, but he is no Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, screaming \"Attica! Attica!\" to an enthusiastic crowd outside. He lacks the charm. He also didn't count on his hostages rising to challenge him, to basically become his co-conspirators.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAngus Cloud as Sterling[3]\nJessica Garza as Ana Marlene[3]\nSterling Beaumon as Cody[4]\nElliot Knight as Abraham[3]\nMousa Hussein Kraish as Amir[3]\nJason O'Mara as Captain Rutledge\nSpencer Garrett as Mr. Laird\nJason Wiles as Dick\nSebastian Sozzi as Dobbs\nBrendan Morrow as Jimmy\nProduction[edit]\nIn December 2021, Angus Cloud, Jessica Garza, Elliot Knight, Jason O'Mara, Spencer Garrett, Mousa Hussein Kraish, Jason Wiles, and Sebastian Sozzi joined the cast of the film, with Daniel Brown writing and directing the film.[5] Principal photography began in Los Angeles that same month.[4]\n\nRelease[edit]\nYour Lucky Day premiered at 2023 Fantastic Fest on September 23, and was released in theatres on November 10, 2023, and on video on demand on November 14, 2023.[6] The cast was able to promote the film due to production receiving a SAG-AFTRA interim agreement during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[7] The film is one of Cloud's last roles before his death in July 2023.[8] The movie made its SVOD debut on Netflix US in March 2024.[9]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 28 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10.[10] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Your Lucky Day (2023)\".
