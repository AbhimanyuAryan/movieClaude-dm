    "Production": [
        "Principal photography began in January 2020 in Cincinnati, under the working title Open Source. According to the Los Angeles Times and actress Lala Kent, an incident occurred on set when co-star Bruce Willis incidentally fired a gun loaded with blanks on the wrong cue and then did it again on the next take. Nobody was injured but the report said the incident left some crew members \"shaken\". Hard Kill is one of the last films to star Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed with aphasia."

        "Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said that Willis \"seems to have settled on making listless appearances in forgettable B-movie action movies as a retirement funding plan\". He said that although Metcalfe \"boasts the appropriate physicality\" for his role, he is \"unable to summon sufficient charisma to make his character remotely interesting\".  Scheck called the other performances \"equally lackluster\" except for Marie, who \"makes for a convincing female badass\". Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: \"I can only hope that Bruce Willis managed to squeeze a house out of the producers of this breathtakingly poor mess about a, ahem, 'quantum' military computer program that can either destroy the world or save it.\""
