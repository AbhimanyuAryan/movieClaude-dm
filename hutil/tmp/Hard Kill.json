It was released on August 21, 2020, by Vertical Entertainment, and was critically panned.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nUpset that her revolutionary technology will be misused for military purposes, Eva Chalmers approaches an extremist known as the Pardoner, who promises to help her use it to save the world.  When she balks at his terrorist plans, he takes her hostage and attempts to coerce her father, Donovan, into revealing the code to activate it.  Donovan hires a team of mercenaries led by Derek Miller to rescue Eva and recover the tech.\n\nCast[edit]\nJesse Metcalfe as Derek Miller[7]\nBruce Willis as Donovan Chalmers[8]\nNatalie Eva Marie as Sasha[9]\nLala Kent as Eva Chalmers[10]\nTexas Battle as Nicholas Fox\nSwen Temmel as Dash Hawkins\nSergio Rizzuto as the Pardoner\nTyler Jon Olson as Lt.

Nobody was injured but the report said the incident left some crew members \"shaken\". Hard Kill is one of the last films to star Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed with aphasia.[13]\n\nRelease[edit]\nHard Kill was simultaneously released in limited theaters and video on-demand in the United States on August 21, 2020.[14][15] It then became available to stream on Netflix in the USA on November 23, 2020, and was the top streamed film for several weeks.[16]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAs of October 29, 2020, Hard Kill grossed $111,523 in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam.[5][17]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 21 reviews and an average rating of 2.7/10.[18]\nFrank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said that Willis \"seems to have settled on making listless appearances in forgettable B-movie action movies as a retirement funding plan\". He said that although Metcalfe \"boasts the appropriate physicality\" for his role, he is \"unable to summon sufficient charisma to make his character remotely interesting\".  Scheck called the other performances \"equally lackluster\" except for Marie, who \"makes for a convincing female badass\".[2] Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: \"I can only hope that Bruce Willis managed to squeeze a house out of the producers of this breathtakingly poor mess about a, ahem, 'quantum' military computer program that can either destroy the world or save it.\"[19]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n\nWorst Supporting Actor\n\nBruce Willis (also for Breach and Survive the Night)\n\nNominated\n\n[20]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ WCPO-TV (January 30, 2020). \"Bruce Willis returns to Cincinnati to shoot another movie\".
