It premiered at the 2020 Austin Film Festival where it won the Comedy Vanguard Audience Award for best comedy film.[1] It also won best narrative feature award at the 2020 Maui Film Festival and best comedy at the 2021 Garden State Film Festival and best comedy at CINEQUEST 2021. The film features an ensemble cast including David Lipper, Lindsey Shaw, Keli Price, Ja Rule, Chaz Bono, David Koechner, Eric Roberts, Maya Stojan, Shar Jackson and Ed Begley Jr.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe mockumentary follows brothers and filmmakers Danny and Seymour Gordon who create Reboot Camp, a fake self-help group, and its leader Gordon to expose the exploitive practices of fake gurus and how easy it is to con people into believing just about anything. To their surprise, their absurd Reboot Camp becomes a big success with a devoted following and turns into an actual cult. As the camp grows with more members and celebrities, the brothers run out of funds and the producer pushes them to hire his niece Claire. Reluctant at first, she eventually sees a golden opportunity to make money and causes a rift between the brothers.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDavid Koechner as himself\nKeli Price as Danny\nEd Begley Jr. as John Lehman\nMaya Stojan as Claire\nPierson Fod\u00e9 as Keith\nLindsey Shaw as Maisey\nChaz Bono as Herbert\nShar Jackson as Antina Mooney\nDaniel Nguyen as Jimmy\nEddie McClintock as Cooper\nNicole Aniston as herself\nMaxim Roy as Grace\nEric Roberts as himself\nXimena C\u00f3rdoba as Margot\nBilly Morrison as himself\nDavid Lipper as Seymour / Gordon St. Pierre\nStacey Liane Jackson as herself\nRachelle Carson as Mira Lehman\nJune Lee as Ysable\nJessica Belkin as Ruby\nMelanie Marden as Tiffany\nEliza Roberts as herself\nJa Rule as himself\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment and production[edit]\nReboot Camp was written and directed by independent filmmaker Ivo Raza.
