    "Plot": [
        "The exhibitions of the American Museum of Natural History scare away the latest guard, much to a passing Larry Daley's displeasure. Teddy Roosevelt and Sacagawea tell him that they would prefer that his son, Nick, take over the position and after some reluctance Larry agrees.",
        "Nick himself is struggling as he wants to join the school's jazz recital by being their DJ and so that he can be close to his crush Mia. Despite his teacher Ms. Montefusco seeing promise in him, Nick believes he has failed. Larry explains to Nick that while he will be guarding the History Museum in Japan for the summer, he will be filling in for him at home. Nick thinks he will fail, but Larry manages to get his ex-wife Erica to also agree to it.",
        "Nick is reunited with the rest of the gang including Rexy, Attila, Jedediah, Octavius, Laaa, Dexter the monkey, and Joan of Arc. His first task is to lock the storage room in the basement, but after encountering all the creepy things downstairs, uses a statue to block the door and runs away in fear.\nKahmunrah, who was locked away, breaks free and steals the tablet that brings the exhibitions to life in an effort to rule the world. A chase ensues through the museum, but he manages to escape. Nick and his friends take off after him while Rexy stays behind to guard the museum. While outside, Joan has a vision showing her that Kahmunrah is headed to the Museum of Natural Art where an exhibition on the Temple of Dendur is being held.",
        "The group catch up to Kamunrah and chase him through the art museum. As backup, Kahmunrah brings to life the God of Chaos Seth, who uses his powers to keep Nick and the others at bay. They find the painting that leads to ancient Egypt and enter it. With only a couple of hours until sunrise, Nick and his friends enter the painting as well. While traversing the Nile, Nick begins to feel hopeless as Kahmunrah\u2019s escape was his fault, but the group give him encouragement. They eventually arrive at Dendur and avoid a series of traps before reaching Kahmunrah and Seth, who plan to use the tablet by playing three notes to unleash the Egyptian army of jackals on them.",
        "A fight in the temple ensues with Nick finally overcoming his insecurities. He plays the notes in reverse which causes the tablet to suck away the jackals, Seth and Kahmunrah. Nick and his friends escape, but the sun is already rising. Remembering that he has a poster of the museum that Sacagawea gave him earlier, they use it to head back home just in time.",
        "Nick finally has the confidence in himself to try out for the jazz recital again (this time with success), starts dating Mia and accepts his position as the new night guard at the museum."
