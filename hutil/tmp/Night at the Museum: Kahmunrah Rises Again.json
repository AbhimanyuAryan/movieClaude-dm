The sequel to Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014), it is the first animated film in the Night at the Museum film series and the fourth installment overall, as well as the first animated feature film produced by Atomic Cartoons. The film follows Nick Daley, the son of Larry Daley, as he becomes a night guard at the Museum of Natural History. In addition to Nick Daley, it also features Kahmunrah, the main antagonist of Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009).\nUnlike the live-action films, 1492 Pictures is not involved with the film. Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again was released on December 9, 2022, on Disney+, to generally positive reviews from critics.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe exhibitions of the American Museum of Natural History scare away the latest guard, much to a passing Larry Daley's displeasure. Teddy Roosevelt and Sacagawea tell him that they would prefer that his son, Nick, take over the position and after some reluctance Larry agrees.\nNick himself is struggling as he wants to join the school's jazz recital by being their DJ and so that he can be close to his crush Mia. Despite his teacher Ms. Montefusco seeing promise in him, Nick believes he has failed. Larry explains to Nick that while he will be guarding the History Museum in Japan for the summer, he will be filling in for him at home. Nick thinks he will fail, but Larry manages to get his ex-wife Erica to also agree to it.\nNick is reunited with the rest of the gang including Rexy, Attila, Jedediah, Octavius, Laaa, Dexter the monkey, and Joan of Arc. His first task is to lock the storage room in the basement, but after encountering all the creepy things downstairs, uses a statue to block the door and runs away in fear.\nKahmunrah, who was locked away, breaks free and steals the tablet that brings the exhibitions to life in an effort to rule the world. A chase ensues through the museum, but he manages to escape. Nick and his friends take off after him while Rexy stays behind to guard the museum. While outside, Joan has a vision showing her that Kahmunrah is headed to the Museum of Natural Art where an exhibition on the Temple of Dendur is being held.\nThe group catch up to Kamunrah and chase him through the art museum. As backup, Kahmunrah brings to life the God of Chaos Seth, who uses his powers to keep Nick and the others at bay. They find the painting that leads to ancient Egypt and enter it. With only a couple of hours until sunrise, Nick and his friends enter the painting as well. While traversing the Nile, Nick begins to feel hopeless as Kahmunrah\u2019s escape was his fault, but the group give him encouragement. They eventually arrive at Dendur and avoid a series of traps before reaching Kahmunrah and Seth, who plan to use the tablet by playing three notes to unleash the Egyptian army of jackals on them.\nA fight in the temple ensues with Nick finally overcoming his insecurities. He plays the notes in reverse which causes the tablet to suck away the jackals, Seth and Kahmunrah. Nick and his friends escape, but the sun is already rising. Remembering that he has a poster of the museum that Sacagawea gave him earlier, they use it to head back home just in time.\nNick finally has the confidence in himself to try out for the jazz recital again (this time with success), starts dating Mia and accepts his position as the new night guard at the museum.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nHumans[edit]\nJoshua Bassett as Nick Daley, the son of Larry Daley, and the newest security guard at the American Museum of Natural History.

The plot centers around Larry's son, Nick, who is hesitant to follow in his father's footsteps as nightwatchman. In addition to Nick and Kahmunrah, the film also features other returning characters: Jedediah, Octavius, Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt and Sacagawea, with the addition of Joan of Arc. In August 2021, Shawn Levy said that the film would debut on Disney+ in 2022.[6] In September 2022, Matt Danner revealed he was directing the film; he previously was the creator and showrunner of the Disney animated show Legend of the Three Caballeros (2018).[7] Several crew members from Legend of the Three Caballeros worked on the film, with Danner describing it as a \"spiritual successor\" to the series.[8][9] In November 2022, the release date of December 9, 2022 was revealed.[1]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nThe animation was handled by Atomic Cartoons, using the same style they used from their previous work, Little Demon, enhancing lighting and character rigging. The film has a 2D animation style, making it the first 2D animated film released under Walt Disney Pictures since Winnie the Pooh.[10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn March 2022, John Paesano revealed that he was composing the film.[11] By August 29, 2022, Paesano was confirmed as composer, replacing Alan Silvestri from the first three films.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was exclusively released on Disney+ on December 9, 2022 after being delayed from a 2021 release.[1][13][14] This film was released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner instead of 20th Century Studios.[15]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 71% based on reviews from 14 critics, making it the highest-rated movie of the Night at the Museum franchise to date.[16]\n\nFuture[edit]\nThomas Lennon hinted that another film could be developed and expressed interest in doing another live-action film with Ben Stiller. He added that the animated film \"opens up a lot of new possibilities\".[17]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures but the copyright is registered with 20th Century Studios, who originally produced the film.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Mishra, Shrishty (November 3, 2022). \"First 'Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again' Image Teases Nick Daley's Animated Return\".
