The website's consensus reads: \"Malum lures you to clock in for another Mason-esque Last Shift at a haunted police station with sheer blunt lore and gore.\"[13]\nMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave Malum three out of four stars, and wrote that the film is most \"impressive when it turns its talented ensemble cast loose on material that was obviously a lot of fun to play with.\"[14] Matt Donago of Paste commended the film for its \"gruesome indie [special] effects\", and concluded that \"DiBlasi delivers what Last Shift fans will once again enjoy. That's what's slightly disappointing: Malum differentiates [itself from Last Shift], but does it differentiate enough?\"[15] The Austin Chronicle's Richard Whittaker gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its use of jump scares and writing: \"At least Last Shift had a grubby ingenuity. Malum has enough budget to be too glossy to be gutter fun, and adds little visually much beyond some very mediocre practical effects, often feeling that \u2013 yet again \u2013 its ambitions outstripped its grasp.\"[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Malum (18)\".
