He begins wrestling as \u2018El Topo\u2019 until he meets a new trainer, Sabrina, who inspires him to compete as an ex\u00f3tico and trains him to be a winner within this role. He develops the identity of \u2018Cassandro\u2019 and begins to confront elements of his identity and explore his personal relationships whilst gaining a reputation for himself within lucha libre.

The studio would later switch it to a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film upon release following the formation of Amazon MGM Studios Distribution.[8][9]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe music score is by Marcelo Zarvos.[7] The film features songs from the disco era such as \"Call Me\" by Blondie and \"Yes Sir, I Can Boogie\" by Baccara.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2023.[10] It also screened at the 50th Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2023.[11][12] It was released by Amazon MGM Studios in a limited release on September 15, 2023, before streaming via Prime Video on September 22, 2023.[13][14]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 130 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of  7.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal steals hearts as the charismatic Cassandro in this feel-good biopic about a wrestler that triumphs in the macho world of Lucha Libre while embracing his true self.\"[15] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[16]\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called the film an \"entertaining biopic, which doubles as a gorgeous depiction of mother-son love and an exhilarating exploration of fearless queer identity in a macho environment,\" adding, \"Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal nails his best role in years, giving a performance steeped in cheeky humor, resilience and radical self-belief.\"[3]\nCarlos Aguilar of Indiewire rated the film a B+, writing, \"'Cassandro' balances the triumphant exaltation of Arbend\u00e1riz's singular evolution as a trailblazer who didn't set out to become one, with the obvious, still not entirely eliminated bigotry that made his trajectory so significant and groundbreaking in the first place.\"[4]\nRoss Bonaime of Collider wrote that the film \"is both riveting and often touching, and Bernal gives quite possibly his best performance in this beautiful story of finding yourself and becoming who you were always supposed to be.\"[17]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAstra Film Awards\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\nBest International Actor\n\nGael Garc\u00eda Bernal\n\nWon\n\n[18][19]\n\n\nBest International Actress\n\nRoberta Colindrez\n\nNominated\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\nOutstanding Film \u2013 Streaming or TV\n\nCassandro\n\nPending\n\n[20]\n\n\nWomen Film Critics Circle Awards\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nBest Actor\n\nGael Garc\u00eda Bernal\n\n4th place\n\n[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ de la Fuente, Anne Marie (October 3, 2023). \"Amazon Studios Now Called Amazon MGM Studios, Exec Pablo Iacoviello Reveals in Iberseries Keynote\".
