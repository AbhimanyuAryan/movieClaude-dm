It was directed by Jeff Fowler and written by Pat Casey, Josh Miller and John Whittington. Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, Lee Majdoub, Colleen O'Shaughnessey and Jim Carrey reprised their roles, with Idris Elba and Shemar Moore joining the cast. In the film, Sonic and Tails must find the Master Emerald before the villain Dr. Robotnik and a new rival, Knuckles the Echidna.\nFollowing the success of Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), Paramount Pictures announced the sequel in May 2020, with Fowler, Casey, Miller and the cast returning. Filming took place from March to June 2021 in Vancouver and Hawaii. The film draws inspiration from the video games Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), and Sonic & Knuckles (1994).\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 was theatrically released in several markets on March 30, 2022, and in the United States on April 8, by Paramount Pictures and Sega Sammy Group. Like its predecessor, it set several box office records and received positive reviews. It grossed $405.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing video game film in the United States until  The Super Mario Bros. Movie the following year. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is scheduled for 2024, while Knuckles, a spin-off series starring Elba, is scheduled to premiere on Paramount+ in early 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nEight months after banishing Dr. Robotnik to a mushroom planet,[c] Sonic lives with the Wachowskis and attempts to help the public as a vigilante hero with little success due to his recklessness. While on a fishing trip, Tom advises Sonic to remain patient for the day his powers will be needed before he and Maddie depart for her sister Rachel's wedding in Hawaii, leaving Sonic in charge of the house for the weekend. \nWhile staying at home, Sonic is attacked by Robotnik, who has escaped with the help of a powerful anthropomorphic echidna, Knuckles, and returned to Earth for revenge on Sonic. Knuckles demands the location of the legendary Master Emerald, an ancient relic that grants its user ultimate power and the ability to change reality to their will so he can bring honor to his ancestors. Sonic is rescued by Miles \"Tails\" Prower, an anthropomorphic two-tailed fox who idolizes him and comes to warn him about Knuckles. \nSonic convinces Tails to help him find the Master Emerald while Robotnik reunites with his assistant, Agent Stone, and, scheming to steal the emerald, offers to help Knuckles. Following clues on a map given to Sonic by his former guardian, Longclaw, Sonic and Tails find a compass within a temple in Siberia. Knuckles and Robotnik track them and chase Sonic and Tails down a mountain. Knuckles reveals that he lost his whole tribe the same day Sonic lost Longclaw. Despite this brief moment of sympathy, Knuckles and Robotnik steal the compass. However, Knuckles begins to question Robotnik's sense of loyalty and honor when he mocks Sonic for choosing to save an injured and unconscious Tails instead of the compass before causing an avalanche upon them. \nTom saves Sonic and Tails by using a ring to teleport them to the wedding. Rachel's fianc\u00e9 Randall and his wedding guests reveal themselves as undercover agents of the Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) and arrest Sonic, Tails, and Tom. The three are rescued by Maddie and a vengeful Rachel, who reconciles with Randall after he confirms that his feelings for her are real. Meanwhile, Knuckles and Robotnik find an underwater temple containing the Master Emerald.\nBlaming himself for Tails' injuries, Sonic decides to face Knuckles and Robotnik alone and goes to the temple, where he fights with Knuckles to keep him from taking the Master Emerald. Robotnik uses the distraction to seize and fuse himself with the emerald, which explodes and sinks the temple into the water. No longer needing Knuckles, Robotnik betrays him and leaves him and Sonic behind. Teaming up, Sonic and Knuckles manage to escape just as Tails, who has regained consciousness and recovered from his injuries, rescues them in a biplane.\nIn Green Hills, Robotnik uses his new abilities to create a giant robot resembling himself. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles work together to fight the robot and its accompanying drones and reclaim the Master Emerald, but it breaks, splitting into the seven Chaos Emeralds. Tom and Maddie save Sonic, who uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. He defeats Robotnik once and for all by destroying his robot before dispersing the Emeralds and reverting back to normal. In the aftermath, Robotnik is presumed dead, and Knuckles fixes the Master Emerald from the remaining shards before making a pact with Sonic and Tails to protect it from evil, and they start an idyllic life with the Wachowskis. \nIn a mid-credit scene, G.U.N. searches the area for signs of Robotnik, while Stone poses as a G.U.N soldier. Walters receives information about the discovery of a secret research facility housing Project Shadow.\n\nCast[edit]\nVoice cast[edit]\nBen Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog:An anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds, but cannot swim. He wants to use his powers to help others but is brash and irresponsible. Upon learning of his arch-nemesis Dr. Robotnik's return and his search for the mythical Master Emerald, Sonic resolves to stop him by teaming up with his new friend Tails, maturing into the hero he aspires to be.[9][10]\nArchival footage and recordings of Benjamin L. Valic as young Sonic are used during some flashbacks.[11]\nColleen O'Shaughnessey as Miles \"Tails\" Prower: An anthropomorphic yellow-orange fox who can fly with his twin-tails. Tails is a humble genius who invents gadgets for locations and fighting. After finding inspiration in Sonic's bravery against Robotnik, he leaves his home planet for Earth to warn Sonic that Knuckles is hunting him and quickly becomes his friend. O'Shaughnessey is the only voice cast member from the Sonic the Hedgehog games to reprise her role for the film.[12]\nIdris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna: An anthropomorphic red echidna warrior with super strength. He is serious, aggressive, and bad tempered, but has a strong sense of honor. He is the sole survivor of the echidna tribe after they were wiped out by the owl tribe[10] and initially works with Robotnik to retrieve the Master Emerald. However, after Robotnik dishonors their deal and betrays him, Knuckles befriends Sonic and Tails, and aids them in defeating Robotnik. Elba prepared for the role by exploring the character's backstory and identity.[13] Director Jeff Fowler wanted the film's portrayal of Knuckles to be reminiscent of his early appearances, and said \"his entire existence is about honor and about being a warrior\", describing him as \"a force of nature\".[13]\nDonna J. Fulks as Longclaw: An anthropomorphic brown owl, Sonic's late mentor/caregiver and the former guardian of the Master Emerald who is seen in flashbacks and in a holographic message hidden in Sonic's map.\nShadow the Hedgehog makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[14]\n\nLive-action cast[edit]\nJim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, a mad scientist and Sonic's arch-nemesis who he often refers to as \"Eggman\". After escaping from the mushroom planet, Robotnik teams up with Knuckles to retaliate against Sonic and find the Master Emerald.\nJames Marsden as Tom Wachowski, the sheriff of Green Hills, Montana and Sonic's father figure. He goes away to Hawaii with his wife to celebrate Rachel's marriage, leaving Sonic alone in his house.\nTika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski, Tom's wife and the local veterinarian of Green Hills who is Sonic's mother figure. She goes to Hawaii with Tom to celebrate her sister's wedding.[15]\nNatasha Rothwell as Rachel, Maddie's older sister who has an extreme dislike of Tom yet attempts to make up with him for the sake of her wedding to Randall.\nLee Majdoub as Agent Stone, an ex-government agent and Robotnik's assistant.\nTom Butler as Commander Walters, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is now the leader of the military organization Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.).[16]\nShemar Moore as Randall Handel, Rachel's fianc\u00e9 who is a G.U.N. agent and is set to become Jojo's stepfather.[17]\nAdam Pally as Wade Whipple, a deputy sheriff of Green Hills and Tom's friend. He becomes the acting sheriff of Green Hills with Tom away.[15]\nMelody Nosipho Niemann as Jojo, Rachel's daughter and Tom and Maddie's niece who is set to become Randall's stepdaughter.\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn April 2020, Marsden expressed interest in a sequel featuring several characters from the video games, including Tails, who appeared in a mid-credits scene in the first film.[18] Jeff Fowler expressed interest in developing a sequel that focused on Sonic and Tails' friendship and developed Dr. Robotnik.[19] Later that month, Schwartz said that he felt it made sense for Paramount Pictures not to have announced a sequel by that point due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that he was interested in a sequel featuring Tails and a more game-accurate portrayal of Robotnik.[20]\nIn May, Paramount Pictures confirmed that a sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog was in development, with Fowler set to return as director alongside writers Casey and Josh Miller.[21] Neal H. Mortiz, Toby Ascher, and Toru Nakahara will produce the sequel, having previously co-produced the first film alongside Takeshi Ito, while Tim Miller, Hajime Satomi, and Haruki Satomi will return from the first film as executive producers.[21]\nIn December, it was confirmed by storyboard artist Fill Marc that artist Tyson Hesse, who redesigned Sonic for the first film, would be returning.[22] The film title was announced as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in February 2021.[23] In May, a synopsis of the story was released as Paramount submitted a copyright registration to the U.S. Copyright Office catalog.[10]\nThe film is inspired by the video games Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994) and Sonic & Knuckles (1994), but is not a direct adaptation of either. Fowler described the film as \"a melting pot\" of ideas from several Sonic games.[24]\n\nCasting[edit]\nOn January 27, 2020, Jim Carrey said his character, the villain Dr. Robotnik, could be expanded in the sequel: \"I wouldn't mind going to do another one because it was so much fun, first of all, and a real challenge to try to convince people that I have a triple-digit IQ... There is so much room, you know, Robotnik has not reached his apotheosis.\"[25]\nOn March 6, James Marsden confirmed that he had signed on for multiple sequels.[26] The rest of the returning cast, including Carrey, was confirmed throughout 2021.[27][28][15][9][29][30] In February 2021, it was reported that Jason Momoa was in talks for the role of Knuckles the Echidna.[31] On June 16, it was announced that Shemar Moore had joined the cast; it was later confirmed that he would play Randall, Rachel's fianc\u00e9.[17][32] On August 10, it was announced that Idris Elba would play Knuckles the Echidna.[9] For the film's Japanese dub, the Hololive Production-affiliated VTuber Inugami Korone, who also serves as the Japanese brand ambassador of the Sonic series, voiced a character.[33]\n\nFilming[edit]\nIn December 2020, it was reported that the BC Film Commission had listed that the production of the film would occur from March 15 to May 10, 2021, under the working title Emerald Hill, a reference to the opening zone in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 video game.[34] In January 2021, Tika Sumpter revealed that the film would shoot in both Vancouver and Hawaii.[27]\nPrincipal photography began in Vancouver on March 15, 2021, with Brandon Trost serving as cinematographer.[15] As a way to show his gratitude to the crew, Carrey held a raffle on May 7 in order to give away a Chevrolet Blazer; the car was eventually given to a grip.[35] Filming in Vancouver concluded on May 12, 2021.[36] Filming wrapped in Hawaii on June 25, 2021.[37]\n\nVisual effects and animation[edit]\nVisual effects and animation for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was provided by Sega's Marza Animation Planet and Moving Picture Company, after previously working on the first film.[38] John Whittington was announced as co-screenwriter on August 10, 2021.[9] Additionally, DNEG also provided the visual effects for the mushroom planet and the cockpit of the robot, giving it a total of 185 shots used in the film from the studio.[39] Additional visual effects services was provided by Unlisted Studio, Animism Studios, Fish Flight Entertainment, Fatbelly VFX, Unit Motion Design, and Track VFX.\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (soundtrack)\nOn December 8, 2021, Tom Holkenborg, who also composed the first film, was announced to be returning to compose the film's score.[40] The film was supported by a single titled \"Stars in the Sky\", the only original song recorded for the film, by Kid Cudi.[41] The soundtrack album was released by Paramount Music on April 8, 2022.[42]\nOn April 7, 2022, it was announced that \"Up on the Green Hill from Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone - Masado and Miwasco Version -\" by Dreams Come True would be used as the main theme song for the film's release in Japan. The song is the English version of the band's 2021 single \"Tsugi no Se~no! De - On the Green Hill -,\" a vocal version of the theme music of Green Hill Zone from the original game. The Japanese version of the song is also used as the dub's ending theme. The Dreams Come True member Masato Nakamura, who composed the music for the first two Sonic games, also voices a character in the Japanese dub.[43]\nCalling it as a highly enjoyable orchestral ride from start to finish, Zanobard reviews assigned 7/10 and wrote \"Though the orchestral style featured throughout Sonic 2 is still very entertaining, with the way it utilises both established and brand new themes as well as both elevating the tension and enjoyability throughout its many edge-of-your-seat action setpieces being pretty sublime. In essence then; while not perfect, it\u2019s another solid score from Holkenborg.\"[44]\n\nRelease[edit]\nMarketing[edit]\nThe teaser poster was revealed on December 8, 2021.[45] The next day, the first trailer was released at The Game Awards 2021.[46] The trailer includes a reworked version of Masato Nakamura's \"Emerald Hill Zone\" music from the original Sonic the Hedgehog 2 video game.[47] Fans reacted very positively, with Elba as Knuckles attracting particular praise. Reviewers noted the difference in reaction compared to the first film's initial trailer that was released on April 30, 2019.[48][49]\nDuring the week before Super Bowl LVI, Paramount released four TV spots showcasing new footage and the reveal of the Giant Eggman Robot.[50] A special TV spot aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022.[51] The theatrical release poster excluded O'Shaughnessey's name, leading to fan outcry.[52] Updated posters, released shortly thereafter, included her name as well as Sumpter's on the upper billing block.[53][54] The second and final trailer was released on March 14, 2022.[55] Another poster was also revealed, resembling the North American boxart for the original Sonic the Hedgehog 2 video game.[56]\nParamount spent less than $18 million on television spots promoting the film in the U.S., which generated 717 million impressions.[57] On March 29, 2022, King partnered with Sega and Paramount to help create a special edition of the online game Candy Crush Saga in ways to promote the film.[58] The Mill helped do the visuals for the Happy Meal advertisements.[59]\n\nTheatrical[edit]\nOn March 1, 2022, Paramount cancelled the film's Russian release in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[60][61] On March 14, when tickets went on sale for the United States, an early access screening dubbed a \"Fan Event\" was announced for April 6.[62]\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 was first theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in several international markets, including France, Philippines and the Netherlands on March 30, 2022[63][64] and the United Kingdom on April 1, 2022.[65] The film held its world premiere at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles on April 5, 2022,[66] and was theatrically released in the United States on April 8, 2022, in 4DX and Dolby Cinema formats.[67][68][69][70]\n\nHome media[edit]\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 was released for download and streaming on Paramount+ on May 24, 2022. The same day, EPIX added the film to their library following Paramount's pay-one-window deal with the service.[71] It released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 9, 2022. Like its predecessor, the digital and Blu-ray releases come with an exclusive short film, Sonic Drone Home, fully animated by Marza Animation Planet and written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller, while directed by David Nelson and produced by Neal H. Moritz, Toby Ascher, Toru Nakahara and Hitoshi Okuno. The short film features Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles facing off against one of Robotnik's drones in Green Hills' scrapyard. Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic, while Tails, Knuckles, and the drone named Unit are voiced by Alicyn Packard (replacing O'Shaughnessey), Fred Tatasciore (replacing Elba), and Aaron Landon respectively.[72]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 grossed $190.9\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $214.5\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $405.4\u00a0million.[6][7]\nIn the United States and Canada, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released alongside Ambulance and the wide expansion of Everything Everywhere All at Once.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't as much fun as the little blue guy's greatest games, but if you enjoyed the first film, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 serves as a generally acceptable sequel.\"[89] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[90] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (same as the first), while those at PostTrak gave it an 87% positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend it.[57]\nAmy Nicholson of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Jim Carrey's reprised role as a villainous weirdo helps this fast-paced, family-friendly video-game-movie sequel maintain a refreshing silliness.\"[91] Nell Minow of Rogerebert.com gave the film a two out of four, writing, \"Yes, we know we're appropriating details from better movies. It is over-plotted, with three different storylines mixing comedy and adventure.\"[92] Alex Stednan of IGN gave the film a seven out of ten, saying, \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 brings all the humor and charm of its predecessor, while also being delightfully more loyal to its source material.\"[93] Carlos Aguilar of The Wrap also gave the film a positive review, writing, \"The screenplay reflects actual effort, and Jim Carrey gets to be unfettered in his performance, leading a surprisingly satisfying follow-up.\"[94] Leslie Felperin of The Guardian gave the film a three out of four and wrote, \"There's not much to spoil about Sonic the Hedgehog 2 because there's not very much to say about it, other than it's mildly amusing and reasonably competently assembled.\"[95] Brian\nShea of Game Informer gave the film a 8.5 out of 10, writing, \"While Sonic the Hedgehog's unexpected positive reception could have put its sequel in a difficult spot since it comes in with higher expectations, the Jeff Fowler-directed Sonic the Hedgehog 2 clears the higher bar, delivering a better movie in nearly every way.\"[96] In a \"C+\" review, Ross Bonamie of Collider wrote, \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is at its most clever when it's throwing in these clever nods that will appeal to fans who have waited to see this world come to life on the screen in this way with these characters.\"[97]\nJohn Nugent of Empire gave the film a two out of five, writing, \"Sonic's second outing is little more than a half-baked half-term distraction tool \u2014 though Jim Carrey's outrageously committed performance nearly saves the day.\"[98] Brian Lloyd of Entertainment.ie gave the film a three out of five and said, \"Idris Elba as Knuckles is the most galaxy-brain casting idea ever conceived of.\"[99] Bob Hoose of Plugged In gave the film a positive review, saying, \"In short, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 doesn't necessarily grab the gold ring right out the first loop-de-loop, but it won't disappoint the kids or their \"fanboy\" parents by the time you hit the flag-waving goal.\"[100] Thomas Floyd of The Washington Post gave the film a two out of four and wrote, \"In Sonic the Hedgehog 2, there is no problem that its titular speed demon can't outrun. With that in mind, it's especially perplexing that this video game-inspired sequel should be, of all things, a bit sluggish.\"[101] In a \"C\u2212\" review, Siddhant Adlakha of IndieWire wrote, \"It's visual soup where nothing pops or stands out. Almost nothing anyone does or says feels rooted in recognizable character traits, and despite Marsden's most sincere efforts, he finds himself once again unable to meet Sonic's eye-line (a production kerfuffle that would be funny, were it not also another reminder of VFX crunch). Then again, who can blame Marsden's character for not wanting to gaze into a soulless blue abyss?\"[102]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAccolades received by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (film)\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nOutstanding Voice Performance\n\nIdris Elba\n\nNominated\n\n[103][104]\n\n\nThe Game Awards\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nBest Adaptation\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\n\nNominated\n\n[105]\n\n\nGolden Trailer Awards\n\nOctober 6, 2022\n\nBest Animation/Family Poster\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 (WORKS ADV)\n\nNominated\n\n[106][107]\n\n\nMovieguide Awards\n\nFebruary 26, 2023\n\nBest Movies for Families\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\n\nWon[d]\n\n[108]\n\n\nNickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\n\nMarch 4, 2023\n\nFavorite Movie\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\n\nWon\n\n[109]\n\n\nFavorite Movie Actor\n\nJim Carrey\n\nNominated\n\nFuture[edit]\nMain article: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (film)\nIn February 2022, Sega of America and Paramount Pictures confirmed that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and a Knuckles spin-off miniseries are in development. Elba will reprise his role as Knuckles for the series, which is set for release on the streaming service Paramount+ in April 2024.[110] Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is scheduled for release on December 20, 2024. Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic, while Casey, Miller and Whittington return to write the script.[111]\nIn April 2022, after Carrey announced that he was considering retirement from acting,[112] producers Moritz and Ascher confirmed that his role as Dr. Robotnik would not be recast in any sequels if he followed through with his retirement plans, though they remained hopeful that they could develop scripts good enough for him to continue the role.[113] In February 2024, it was confirmed that Carrey will reprise his role.[114] Filming began in July 2023 in Farnham, Surrey, England, albeit with no actors due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[115]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of films based on video games\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Sonic Team, published by Sega, directed and programmed by Yuji Naka, designed by Hirokazu Yasuhara, and illustrated by Naoto Ohshima.[1][2]\n\n^ Known in Japan as Sonic the Movie / Sonic VS Knuckles (Japanese: \u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\uff0f\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af VS \u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30eb\u30ba, Hepburn: Sonikku za M\u016bb\u012b / Sonikku VS Nakkuruzu)[8]\n\n^ As depicted in Sonic the Hedgehog (2020).\n\n^ Tied with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The bizarre evolution of Sonic the Hedgehog\".
