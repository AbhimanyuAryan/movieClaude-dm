    "Plot": [
        "Eight months after banishing Dr. Robotnik to a mushroom planet, Sonic lives with the Wachowskis and attempts to help the public as a vigilante hero with little success due to his recklessness. While on a fishing trip, Tom advises Sonic to remain patient for the day his powers will be needed before he and Maddie depart for her sister Rachel's wedding in Hawaii, leaving Sonic in charge of the house for the weekend.",
        "While staying at home, Sonic is attacked by Robotnik, who has escaped with the help of a powerful anthropomorphic echidna, Knuckles, and returned to Earth for revenge on Sonic. Knuckles demands the location of the legendary Master Emerald, an ancient relic that grants its user ultimate power and the ability to change reality to their will so he can bring honor to his ancestors. Sonic is rescued by Miles \"Tails\" Prower, an anthropomorphic two-tailed fox who idolizes him and comes to warn him about Knuckles.",
        "Sonic convinces Tails to help him find the Master Emerald while Robotnik reunites with his assistant, Agent Stone, and, scheming to steal the emerald, offers to help Knuckles. Following clues on a map given to Sonic by his former guardian, Longclaw, Sonic and Tails find a compass within a temple in Siberia. Knuckles and Robotnik track them and chase Sonic and Tails down a mountain. Knuckles reveals that he lost his whole tribe the same day Sonic lost Longclaw. Despite this brief moment of sympathy, Knuckles and Robotnik steal the compass. However, Knuckles begins to question Robotnik's sense of loyalty and honor when he mocks Sonic for choosing to save an injured and unconscious Tails instead of the compass before causing an avalanche upon them.",
        "Tom saves Sonic and Tails by using a ring to teleport them to the wedding. Rachel's fianc\u00e9 Randall and his wedding guests reveal themselves as undercover agents of the Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) and arrest Sonic, Tails, and Tom. The three are rescued by Maddie and a vengeful Rachel, who reconciles with Randall after he confirms that his feelings for her are real. Meanwhile, Knuckles and Robotnik find an underwater temple containing the Master Emerald.",
        "Blaming himself for Tails' injuries, Sonic decides to face Knuckles and Robotnik alone and goes to the temple, where he fights with Knuckles to keep him from taking the Master Emerald. Robotnik uses the distraction to seize and fuse himself with the emerald, which explodes and sinks the temple into the water. No longer needing Knuckles, Robotnik betrays him and leaves him and Sonic behind. Teaming up, Sonic and Knuckles manage to escape just as Tails, who has regained consciousness and recovered from his injuries, rescues them in a biplane.",
        "In Green Hills, Robotnik uses his new abilities to create a giant robot resembling himself. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles work together to fight the robot and its accompanying drones and reclaim the Master Emerald, but it breaks, splitting into the seven Chaos Emeralds. Tom and Maddie save Sonic, who uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. He defeats Robotnik once and for all by destroying his robot before dispersing the Emeralds and reverting back to normal. In the aftermath, Robotnik is presumed dead, and Knuckles fixes the Master Emerald from the remaining shards before making a pact with Sonic and Tails to protect it from evil, and they start an idyllic life with the Wachowskis.",
        "In a mid-credit scene, G.U.N. searches the area for signs of Robotnik, while Stone poses as a G.U.N soldier. Walters receives information about the discovery of a secret research facility housing Project Shadow."

        "In April 2020, Marsden expressed interest in a sequel featuring several characters from the video games, including Tails, who appeared in a mid-credits scene in the first film. Jeff Fowler expressed interest in developing a sequel that focused on Sonic and Tails' friendship and developed Dr. Robotnik. Later that month, Schwartz said that he felt it made sense for Paramount Pictures not to have announced a sequel by that point due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that he was interested in a sequel featuring Tails and a more game-accurate portrayal of Robotnik.",
        "In May, Paramount Pictures confirmed that a sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog was in development, with Fowler set to return as director alongside writers Casey and Josh Miller. Neal H.

        "The film is inspired by the video games Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994) and Sonic & Knuckles (1994), but is not a direct adaptation of either. Fowler described the film as \"a melting pot\" of ideas from several Sonic games.",
        "On January 27, 2020, Jim Carrey said his character, the villain Dr. Robotnik, could be expanded in the sequel: \"I wouldn't mind going to do another one because it was so much fun, first of all, and a real challenge to try to convince people that I have a triple-digit IQ... There is so much room, you know, Robotnik has not reached his apotheosis.\"",
        "On March 6, James Marsden confirmed that he had signed on for multiple sequels. The rest of the returning cast, including Carrey, was confirmed throughout 2021. In February 2021, it was reported that Jason Momoa was in talks for the role of Knuckles the Echidna. On June 16, it was announced that Shemar Moore had joined the cast; it was later confirmed that he would play Randall, Rachel's fianc\u00e9.

For the film's Japanese dub, the Hololive Production-affiliated VTuber Inugami Korone, who also serves as the Japanese brand ambassador of the Sonic series, voiced a character.",
        "In December 2020, it was reported that the BC Film Commission had listed that the production of the film would occur from March 15 to May 10, 2021, under the working title Emerald Hill, a reference to the opening zone in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 video game. In January 2021, Tika Sumpter revealed that the film would shoot in both Vancouver and Hawaii.",
        "Principal photography began in Vancouver on March 15, 2021, with Brandon Trost serving as cinematographer. As a way to show his gratitude to the crew, Carrey held a raffle on May 7 in order to give away a Chevrolet Blazer; the car was eventually given to a grip.

        "Amy Nicholson of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Jim Carrey's reprised role as a villainous weirdo helps this fast-paced, family-friendly video-game-movie sequel maintain a refreshing silliness.\" Nell Minow of Rogerebert.com gave the film a two out of four, writing, \"Yes, we know we're appropriating details from better movies. It is over-plotted, with three different storylines mixing comedy and adventure.\" Alex Stednan of IGN gave the film a seven out of ten, saying, \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 brings all the humor and charm of its predecessor, while also being delightfully more loyal to its source material.\" Carlos Aguilar of The Wrap also gave the film a positive review, writing, \"The screenplay reflects actual effort, and Jim Carrey gets to be unfettered in his performance, leading a surprisingly satisfying follow-up.\" Leslie Felperin of The Guardian gave the film a three out of four and wrote, \"There's not much to spoil about Sonic the Hedgehog 2 because there's not very much to say about it, other than it's mildly amusing and reasonably competently assembled.\" Brian\nShea of Game Informer gave the film a 8.5 out of 10, writing, \"While Sonic the Hedgehog's unexpected positive reception could have put its sequel in a difficult spot since it comes in with higher expectations, the Jeff Fowler-directed Sonic the Hedgehog 2 clears the higher bar, delivering a better movie in nearly every way.\" In a \"C+\" review, Ross Bonamie of Collider wrote, \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is at its most clever when it's throwing in these clever nods that will appeal to fans who have waited to see this world come to life on the screen in this way with these characters.\"",

With that in mind, it's especially perplexing that this video game-inspired sequel should be, of all things, a bit sluggish.\" In a \"C\u2212\" review, Siddhant Adlakha of IndieWire wrote, \"It's visual soup where nothing pops or stands out. Almost nothing anyone does or says feels rooted in recognizable character traits, and despite Marsden's most sincere efforts, he finds himself once again unable to meet Sonic's eye-line (a production kerfuffle that would be funny, were it not also another reminder of VFX crunch). Then again, who can blame Marsden's character for not wanting to gaze into a soulless blue abyss?\""
