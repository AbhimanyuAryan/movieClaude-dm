Produced by Paramount Animation and Jane Startz Productions, it is directed by Raman Hui and co-directed by Paul Watling and Yong Duk Jhun (in their directorial debuts) from a screenplay by David Magee and Christopher Yost. The film stars the voices of Brandon Soo Hoo, Henry Golding, Lucy Liu, Sandra Oh, and Michelle Yeoh.\nCartoon Network originally opted to produce a live-action/CG hybrid television film adaptation of the novel in the late 2000s, but it never came to fruition. Paramount later acquired the rights for an animated film in March 2019, with Carlos Baena attached as director, and Mikros Animation providing animation. Much of the voice cast was revealed between 2020 and 2022, following Golding's casting in July 2020. Hui later replaced Baena as director in January 2022. Steve Jablonsky composed the score.[2][3]\nOriginally planned for theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, The Tiger's Apprentice was released on Paramount+ on February 2, 2024 after being delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 2009 in Hong Kong, Mrs. Lee and her baby grandson Tom are chased by yaoguai. Mrs. Lee is able to fend them off with the help of the Zodiac Warriors, a group of shapeshifters rooted in the Chinese zodiac, before confronting Loo, a sorceress controlling the yaoguai. Fifteen years later, Tom, now living with his grandmother in San Francisco, faces a bully at school, partially for the Chinese-appearance of his house, when he inadvertently unleashes a magical force. After school, Tom removes some charms from his home, which unbeknownst to him were protecting against the evil spirits.\nSoon after, Mr. Hu, the tiger of the Warriors. visits after sensing that the charms have been dispatched. During the fight, Mrs. Lee throws the stone to Tom, making him the guardian right at that moment, before activates all the protective charms together, which results in a blast intended to kill her and Loo, but the latter survives.\nHu brings Tom to a safe place where he comes to know about the Zodiac Warriors and how they swore to protect the guardian. Later that night, Tom has a dream where he sees a bright Phoenix being covered in darkness, and a woman tells her that now he walks two worlds: the world of mortals and the world of magic.\nSoon the whole group of Zodiac Warriors are reunited at the Temple of Twelve. However, some of the Zodiac Warriors don't show up, which leads to an uneasy situation. In the meantime, Tom goes to confront Loo, who's revealed to be the mother of R\u00e4v, the new student at Tom's school. The Zodiac Warriors arrive, learning that the missing members were captured by Loo, as another few become trapped as well. Tom, R\u00e4v, and the remaining members eventually escape.\nTom focuses on his training. To gain complete power as a guardian, he must be able to see the Phoenix inside the stone, which Tom's lineage is able to see. Mistral, the dragon, tells Tom one night that during the fight between Mrs. Lee and Loo, Hu died protecting him. Later, after thrashing Loo in the battle, Mrs. Lee gave a part of her soul to save Hu. Later, Tom sees his grandmother, but is revealed to be Loo, who steals the Phoenix Stone from him.\nAfter Tom informs the Warrirors, Hu reveals that Loo will use the stone on the eve of the Lunar New Year when the sun sets. On that day, Tom and the Warriors find Loo, and a large battle ensues. Hu us briefly captured, but is freed along with the other Warriors. However, Loo activates the Phoenix stone to suck all the souls out of the mortals. Just then, Tom finally sees the Phoenix inside the stone. Tom removes the darkness torturing the Phoenix, reversing the effects and. defeating Loo.\nHowever, Tom dies with his soul is about to leave. Hu, with the help of the other Zodiac Warriors, performs Na Kua, which leads him to the Ocean of Tears. There, Hu pleads to the Empress to give away a part of his soul to save Tom, which is accepted. Later, Hu offers his shop as Tom's new home. In the mid-credit scene, Tom, as a result of containing part of Hu's soul, is able to transform into a tiger.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nBrandon Soo Hoo as Tom Lee, the new guardian in training[4]\nLydie Loots as Baby Tom\nHenry Golding as Mr. Hu, Tom\u2019s mentor and the Tiger guardian[4][2]\nLucy Liu as Nu Kua / Cynthia, Nu Kua's the empress of the spirit world.
