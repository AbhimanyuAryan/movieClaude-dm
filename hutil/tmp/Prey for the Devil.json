The film is produced under the studio Lionsgate and is directed by Daniel Stamm. It stars Jacqueline Byers, Colin Salmon, Christian Navarro, Lisa Palfrey, Nicholas Ralph, Virginia Madsen, and Ben Cross. Lionsgate distributed Prey for the Devil in theaters in the United States and Canada on October 28, 2022. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $44.7 million worldwide.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn response to a global rise in demonic possessions, the Catholic Church reopens exorcism schools to train priests in the Rite of Exorcism. \nAlthough nuns are forbidden to perform exorcisms, Father Quinn recognizes Sister Ann's gifts, including empathy with possessed victims of demons, and agrees to train her. Thrust onto the spiritual frontline with fellow student Father Dante, Ann finds herself in a battle for the soul of a young girl, Natalie, who she believes is possessed by a demon who tormented Ann's mentally unstable mother years ago. \nAnn attends classes, against some resistance from staff members and amusement by some priests. Frightening events begin to happen to her, such as disturbing visions and memories, and an elderly, possessed male patient harassing her and dancing with her against her will when she is trapped in his room. However, Ann persists in her quest, delving into secret archives with the help of Dante, and looking into the histories of \"terminal cases\" likely to die, and of one woman who was released from the institute. \nAnn helps exorcise Dante's troubled sister, apparently successfully. However, the school's leadership and the Cardinal tell her next morning that the woman killed herself. Ann unhappily concludes that she will go back to her old convent in response to the tragedy. However, Dante drops by and says that Natalie, who had recovered and left the school, has had a relapse and is likely to be sent to the Vatican as a \"terminal case\". He convinces her to sneak into the school with him and exorcise Natalie.\nAnn is shocked to find that Natalie is her own daughter, whom Ann gave up for adoption years ago, when she was pregnant as a teenager. The anguish of abandonment has made Natalie subject to demonic possession. Eventually, the demon leaves Natalie, but possesses Ann, who falls into a large pool of holy water and, fighting through the anguish of her troubled history, eventually frees herself from the demon.\nThe school's leadership reward her with an academic fellowship to the Vatican; however, while in a cab, Ann finds that the driver is the old man who had harassed her under demonic influence. The cab stops in the street, and a sinister-looking woman, who was the one released from the institute, stares at her from the street. Ann arms herself with a crucifix as the driver snarls and lunges at her.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJacqueline Byers as Ann\nColin Salmon as Father Quinn\nChristian Navarro as Father Dante\nLisa Palfrey as Sister Euphemia\nNicholas Ralph as Father Raymond\nPosy Taylor as Natalie\nBen Cross as Cardinal Matthews\nVirginia Madsen as Dr. Peters\nCora Kirk as Emilia\nProduction[edit]\nIn October 2019, the film was first announced as The Devil's Light. The screenplay was written by Robert Zappia, and James Hawes was initially set to direct.[1] Lionsgate and Gold Circle Films co-produced the film, with shooting planned to take place in the spring of 2020.[2] Paul Brooks, Jessica Malanaphy, Todd R. Jones, and Earl Richey Jones produced the film while Scott Niemeyer, David Brooks and Brad Kessell were executive producers.[3] Zappia's screenplay, originally titled The Devil's Flame, had made the 2018 BloodList.[4] In February 2020, Daniel Stamm was set to direct instead, marking his return to the exorcism sub-genre after the 2010 film The Last Exorcism.[5][6] In June 2020, Jacqueline Byers was announced as the lead actress, starring alongside Virginia Madsen, Ben Cross, Colin Salmon, Christian Navarro, and Nicholas Ralph.[7]\nFilming took place during the summer of 2020 in Sofia, Bulgaria.[8] Actor Ben Cross died on August 18, 2020, and had wrapped filming for his part ten days beforehand.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nPrey for the Devil was released in theatres on October 28, 2022, by Lionsgate.[10] It was previously scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on January 8, 2021, then moved to February 11, 2022.[11][12][13]\nThe film was released for VOD platforms on December 13, 2022, followed by a Blu-ray, DVD and 4K UHD release on January 3, 2023.[14]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nPrey for the Devil grossed $19.8\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $24.9\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $44.7\u00a0million.[15]\nIn the United States and Canada, Prey for the Devil was released alongside the wide expansions of T\u00e1r and Till, and was projected to gross $7\u20138 million from 2,980 theaters in its opening weekend.[16] The film made $2.8 million on its first day, including $660,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $7.2 million, finishing third at the box office.[17] In its second weekend the film dropped 46% to $3.9 million, finishing in fifth.[18]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 17% of 35 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"There's no dearth of possession stories within the genre, and potboiler Prey for the Devil may leave completists needing a truly horrific \u2014 or at least fun \u2014 exorcist palate cleanser.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 38 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[20]\nLeigh Monson of The A.V. Club gave the film a D grade, writing, \"Its dominant thematic threads are at war with one another, shambling around as one story wears the flesh and appearance of another, leaving neither premise wholly intact in a film with the meat stripped from its bones.\"[21] The South China Morning Post's James Marsh gave it 1/5 stars, saying it \"seems content to congregate crowds of stern-faced priests around a shrieking bedridden child and have them spout erroneous incantations for 90 minutes. Even with the most forgiving of horror fans, it doesn't have a hope in hell.\"[22] A.A. Dowd of the Houston Chronicle called the film \"a piously dull and scare-free addition to the ever-growing canon of Exorcist wannabes\" and \"just another regurgitation of yesterday's devout scare tactics, spewing diet 'Exorcism' clich\u00e9s as freely as Linda Blair once painted the walls in pea soup.\"[23]\nDennis Harvey of Variety was more positive, writing, \"even if it falls short of being particularly memorable or scary, this is a decently entertaining possession potboiler.\"[24]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kay, Jeremy (October 30, 2019). \"Lionsgate International to Launch AFM sales on Supernatural Thriller The Devil's Light\".
