        "Lex, a writer who studies horror fiction, and her three friends travel to a Hawaiian island to investigate reports of a haunting at an abandoned hotel resort. The group starts off joking and playing in a scenic waterfall, but it quickly turns into a night of horror when they can't find the way they came, their flashlights are dying, and the Half-Face Girl from the ghost stories about the resort begins coming after them.",
        "Bree is the first death, when a security car locks everyone but her out of it, the engine starts on its own and drives her off the resort balcony. After Chris confirms Bree's state, the three take off in order to exit and escape the Half-Face Girl. Sam is then possessed, causing concern from the rest of the group. He tries to strangle Chris, only for Lex to stab him in the neck with scissors. Due to his new nature, he doesn't quite die, and the Half-Face Girl rips off Sam's face. The Half-Face Girl then stalks after Lex and Chris, who attempt to exit in an elevator. Chris sacrifices himself so that Lex can get up the elevator as the Half-Face Girl tries to climb up and reach her.",
        "Upon exiting, Lex finds Bree, who is badly injured and blinded from the crash. Seemingly possessed, Bree sings happy birthday to Lex, before igniting a flame beneath herself. Lex narrates this all from a hospital bed to a skeptical detective, who's unsure how to take all that she's saying, especially since the photos she took aren't on her phone anymore. Lex claims that it's also hard to watch all your friends die to something so unbelievable. When the detective gets up to make a call to his station, under the guise of scouring the island to help find whoever caused the deaths of her friends, Lex starts fooling with her camera. After taking a picture of the detective, she notices that he has similar veins to that of the possessed, and lowers her phone. The place around her crumbles, revealing that she's still back at the resort. She never left."
