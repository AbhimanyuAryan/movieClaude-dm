Willis gets a little more to do here than in previous Knight thrillers\".[18] Michael Szymanski of Mike Szy The Writer gave the film a 9/10 rating, writing, \"this crime thriller trilogy of the Detective Knight series is a fitting finale to Bruce Willis's action movie career\".[19]\nIn a negative review, Lapacazo Sandoval of New York Amsterdam News wrote \"Would I ever pay money to watch this in a theater, the answer is no.
