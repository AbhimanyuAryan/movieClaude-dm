        "In October 2022, it was reported that Universal Pictures had set M. Night Shyamalan's next film after the release of Knock at the Cabin for an April 2024 release. The title of the film was revealed to be Trap in February 2023, as Shyamalan announced that he was entering a first-look deal with competing studio Warner Bros.",
        "Principal photography was scheduled to begin in Cincinnati, Ohio in August 2023, where it would have received over $9 million in tax credits from the state to film there. Due to Shyamalan producing and financing his own films, the production was granted an interim agreement to be allowed to film during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Under the working title Good Grades, filming began in Mississauga, Ontario on October 16, 2023 and concluded the following December 8. Marc Bienstock and Ashwin Rajan produced the film with Shyamalan."
