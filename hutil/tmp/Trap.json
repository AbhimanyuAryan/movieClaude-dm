Night Shyamalan's next film after the release of Knock at the Cabin for an April 2024 release.[2] The title of the film was revealed to be Trap in February 2023, as Shyamalan announced that he was entering a first-look deal with competing studio Warner Bros.[3] Marc Bienstock and Ashwin Rajan produced the film with Shyamalan.[4]\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to begin in Cincinnati, Ohio in August 2023,[5] where it would have received over $9 million in tax credits from the state to film there.[6] Due to Shyamalan producing and financing his own films, the production was granted an interim agreement to be allowed to film during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[7] Under the working title Good Grades, filming took place in Toronto from October 16 to December 8, 2023.[7][4] The film's pop concert venue known as \"Tanaka Arena\" was filmed inside FirstOntario Centre with Rogers Centre used as the venue's exterior.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTrap is scheduled to be released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 9, 2024.[9] It was previously scheduled to be released on August 2.[3] It will be Shyamalan's first film with the studio since Lady in the Water (2006).\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Dunn, Jack; Riley, Jenelle (April 18, 2024). \"'Trap' Trailer: M.
