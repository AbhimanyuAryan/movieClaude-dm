Directed by Mark Dindal from a screenplay written by David Reynolds and the writing team of Paul A. Kaplan and Mark Torgove, the film stars Chris Pratt as the voice of the titular character, alongside the voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Hannah Waddingham, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, Cecily Strong, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, Brett Goldstein, Bowen Yang, and Snoop Dogg.\nDevelopment on a new animated Garfield film began in May 2016, with producers and writers already attached. Dindal was announced as the film's director in November 2018, and pre-production began the following month. Despite Viacom acquiring most of the rights to Garfield in August 2019, production proceeded without their involvement. In November 2021, Sony purchased the distribution rights for the film, and Pratt was cast as Garfield. The rest of the cast joined in 2022. John Debney, a frequent collaborator of Dindal, composed the score.[2]\nThe Garfield Movie is set to be theatrically released in the United States on May 24, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nGarfield (voiced by Chris Pratt), the world-famous, Monday-hating, lasagna-loving indoor cat, is about to have a wild outdoor adventure! After an unexpected reunion with his long-lost father \u2013 scruffy street cat Vic (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) \u2013 Garfield and his canine friend Odie (voiced by Harvey Guill\u00e9n) are forced from their perfectly pampered life into joining Vic in a hilarious, high-stakes heist.\u2014\u200aThe Garfield Movie official website[3]\nVoice cast[edit]\nChris Pratt as Garfield, a cynical and lazy orange tabby cat who loves lasagna, sleeping, hates Mondays and exercise[4]\nSamuel L. Jackson as Vic, Garfield's biological father[4]\nHannah Waddingham as Jinx[4]\nVing Rhames as Otto[4]\nNicholas Hoult as Jon Arbuckle, Garfield and Odie's owner[4]\nCecily Strong as Marge\nHarvey Guill\u00e9n as Odie, a dim-witted yellow dog and Garfield's best friend[4]\nBrett Goldstein as Roland[4]\nBowen Yang as Nolan[4]\nJanelle James as Olivia\nSnoop Dogg as Snoop Catt[5]\nErnest Guillart as Cooper\nAdditionally, Liz Wilson and Nermal will appear in the film.[6]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn May 2016, seven years after 20th Century Fox's license with Paws, Inc. expired, it was announced that Alcon Entertainment would develop a new CG animated Garfield film, with John Cohen and Steven P. Wegner producing, from a script by Mark Torgove and Paul A. Kaplan.[7][8] Mark Dindal was announced as director in November 2018, with pre-production beginning the following month.[9] In August 2019, Viacom (now known as Paramount Global) acquired most of the rights to Garfield, leaving the status of the film at the time uncertain. However, in December 2020, Dindal confirmed that the film was still in production.[10]\nIn November 2021, David Reynolds was announced to write the film, reuniting with Dindal after having previously worked together on Disney's The Emperor's New Groove (2000).[11] Sony Pictures would distribute the film under its Columbia Pictures label except for China, and DNEG Animation would provide the animation.[12][13] By September 2023, it was reported that the film would be entitled The Garfield Movie.[14][15]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn November 2021, Chris Pratt was announced to star as Garfield. In May 2022, it was reported that Samuel L. Jackson joined the film as Garfield's father, Vic.[16] In August 2022, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, Hannah Waddingham and Cecily Strong were added to the cast.[17] In November 2022, Brett Goldstein and Bowen Yang were added to the cast.[18] Harvey Guill\u00e9n was confirmed to voice Odie in November 2023,[19] and Hoult was later confirmed to voice Jon Arbuckle in December 2023.[20] With the release of the second trailer in March 2024, Snoop Dogg was revealed to star in the film, and Janelle James was also announced to star the same month.[21][22]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn November 2023, it was reported that John Debney would compose the film's score, marking his third collaboration with Dindal following The Emperor's New Groove and Chicken Little (2005).[23] Snoop Dogg collaborated with Keith Urban on a song for the film titled \"Let It Roll\", which was released as a single on April 12, 2024.[24]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Garfield Movie is scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on May 24, 2024.[25] It was previously scheduled for release on February 16, 2024.[26]\nIn April 2021, Sony signed deals with Netflix and Disney for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the films' theatrical and home media windows. Netflix signed for exclusive \"pay 1 window\" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window and included The Garfield Movie. Disney signed for \"pay 2 window\" rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.[27]\n\nVideo game[edit]\nA video game based on the film is set to be released in 2024.[28][29]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Garfield Movie (U)\".
