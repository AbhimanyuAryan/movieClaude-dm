It is written by Stephen Mazur and Cory Edwards and produced by Jon Kuyper.[4] The film is produced by Universal 1440 Entertainment in co-production with Universal Animation Studios, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination, and distributed by Netflix.[5]\nThe film was released on April 12, 2024 on Netflix.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAfter getting kicked out of the forest for tormenting a camper until he can redeem himself, Woody decides that he can redeem by learning about teamwork in the nearby Camp Woo Hoo \u2014 but after arriving, an escaped convict named Buzz Buzzard arrives shortly and then poses as the rival camp's chef to rob a hidden treasure.\nAfter Woody arrives, he befriends the camp director's daughter, Maggie, and causes chaos at the camp but after Buzz's failed attempts to destroy the camp and after Woody gets to know the campers and helps the campers train for an annual camp game event known as the Wilderness Games, he gets framed for causing chaos again after meeting and fighting Buzz. An inspector arrives and threatens to shut down the camp. Fortunately, Woody convinces the inspector to give the camp one more chance by letting them participate in the Wilderness Games. As the Games proceed, Buzz observes with dismay and tries to sabotage Woo Hoo's chances of winning.\nBefore the final challenge, Woody finally discovers Buzz's evil plot and fires a flare gun to rally both camps back to the main grounds, where Woody exploits Buzz's illegal arsenal purchasing and plans to steal the gold. The camps try to save the chest that Buzz has caught, but Woody sacrifices his attempt to defeat Buzz and saves Maggie from falling before rendering himself unconscious.\nAfterwards, the camps reconcile when they discover their statue had been the gold all along, and Woody is filled with emotion when he discovers he has a long-forgotten ancestor on the land. Before Woody flies back to the forest with his newfound redemption, he hugs Maggie goodbye, saying he'll be back the following summer.\nIn a post-credits scene, after accidentally crash-landing their helicopter, Buzz and his escaped cellmate find themselves at a police station, where officers have turned up to re-arrest him for their warrant.[4]\n\nCast[edit]\nEric Bauza as Woody Woodpecker\nKevin Michael Richardson as Buzz Buzzard[6]\nTom Kenny as Wally Walrus/Inspector\nMary-Louise Parker as Angie\nChloe De Los Santos as Maggie\nJosh Lawson as Zane\nEsther Son as Rose\nEvan Stanhope as Gus\nGeorge Holahan-Cantwell as Orson\nKershawn Theodore as Mikey\nCC Dewar as Devin\nDeclan Thorn as Screaming Extra 2\nProduction[edit]\nIn 2021, Universal Pictures and Universal 1440 Entertainment announced a sequel to the 2017 Woody Woodpecker movie.
