    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10.",
        "The Los Angeles Times's Noel Murray asserted \"Even without its paranormal elements, Jagged Mind is a powerful portrait of the dissociation that occurs when a person tries to justify the misbehavior of someone they love.\" Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya of Autostraddle said, \"While imperfect in some of its plotting, Jagged Mind is delicious in its thematic underpinnings, execution of horror (with evocative editing and directing on this front), and performances. Richardson-Sellers and Woodward (both queer IRL btw) are electric scene partners, and Woodward makes an extremely compelling villain. The script could have easily tilted into Lifetime original movie territory if not for the direction and these performances.\"",
        "Paul L\u00ea from Bloody Disgusting gave the film a rating of three out of five, saying, \"[the] film is often compelling and tense, the two leads deliver strong and vulnerable performances, and the outcome is rewarding. Supporters of queer filmmaking will be enthused to see not only a new genre story where the central conflict has nothing to do with sexuality issues, and the characters are layered and imperfect.\" Randy Myers writing for The Mercury News gave the film a score of one and half out of five, saying \"An under-realized screenplay fails all involved, particularly lead Maisie Richardson Sellers. She gives it her all as Billie, a queer woman with a rotten streak with women. She also blacks out and finds herself stuck in a Groundhog Day-like loop. Therein lies the plot problem, Jagged Mind repeats its scenes too often, making it feel like this originated as a short film that got stretched into a feature.\""
