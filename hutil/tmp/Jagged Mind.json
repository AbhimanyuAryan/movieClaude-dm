(June 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nAfter Billie begins dating a mysterious woman named Alex, she suddenly becomes plagued by blackouts and strange visions that lead her to discover she's stuck in a series of time loops.[1]\n\nCast[edit]\nMaisie Richardson-Sellers as Billie\nShannon Woodward as Alex\nRosaline Elbay as Christine\nShein Mompremier as Rose\nKate Szekely as Kim\nJimmy Jean-Louis as Papa Juste\nCasey Ford Alexander as Dr. Ortiz\nProduction[edit]\nJagged Mind is based on writer Allyson Morgan's short film First Date, that aired on season one of the Hulu series Bite Size Halloween (2020). Produced by 20th Digital Studio and Palabra Productions as a Hulu original film, it is directed by Kelley Kali from a screenplay by Morgan. Maisie Richardson-Sellers and Shannon Woodward portray new girlfriends, Billie and Alex, respectively.[2] Filming took place in the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami.[3] Jongnic Bontemps composed the film's score.[4]\n\nRelease[edit]\nJagged Mind premiered at the American Black Film Festival on June 14, 2023. It was released in the United States on Hulu the following day and is expected to air on Disney+ (via Star) internationally at a later date.[5]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10.[6]\nThe Los Angeles Times's Noel Murray asserted \"Even without its paranormal elements, Jagged Mind is a powerful portrait of the dissociation that occurs when a person tries to justify the misbehavior of someone they love.\"[7] Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya of Autostraddle said, \"While imperfect in some of its plotting, Jagged Mind is delicious in its thematic underpinnings, execution of horror (with evocative editing and directing on this front), and performances. Richardson-Sellers and Woodward (both queer IRL btw) are electric scene partners, and Woodward makes an extremely compelling villain. The script could have easily tilted into Lifetime original movie territory if not for the direction and these performances.\"[8]\nPaul L\u00ea from Bloody Disgusting gave the film a rating of three out of five, saying, \"[the] film is often compelling and tense, the two leads deliver strong and vulnerable performances, and the outcome is rewarding. Supporters of queer filmmaking will be enthused to see not only a new genre story where the central conflict has nothing to do with sexuality issues, and the characters are layered and imperfect.\"[9] Randy Myers writing for The Mercury News gave the film a score of one and half out of five, saying \"An under-realized screenplay fails all involved, particularly lead Maisie Richardson Sellers. She gives it her all as Billie, a queer woman with a rotten streak with women. She also blacks out and finds herself stuck in a Groundhog Day-like loop. Therein lies the plot problem, Jagged Mind repeats its scenes too often, making it feel like this originated as a short film that got stretched into a feature.\"[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Paz, Maggie Dela (June 1, 2023). \"Jagged Mind Trailer Previews Hulu's Queer Psychological Thriller\".
