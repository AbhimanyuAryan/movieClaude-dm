    "Plot": [
        "The Cooper family live in Pittsburgh and are happy together, with the father, survival expert Ray, and his teenage daughter Rachel sharing an interest in practicing mixed martial arts and self-defense at the gym Ray runs. However, things go downhill when Amanda Cooper, Ray's wife, falls ill with cancer. Her husband is told that a new life-saving drug developed by BioPrime could save her. However, he subsequently learns it was pulled off the market due to BioPrime CEO Simon Keeley paying the manufacturer to delay production. Ray sees Keeley on a live TV interview show and Ray calls in and threatens to kill Keeley if his wife dies. After Amanda dies, Ray and Rachel are devastated.",
        "Six months later, Ray receives a call from investigative journalist Martin Bennett, who tells him that he has evidence of criminal activity and corruption committed by BioPrime. They meet on a subway, unaware they were followed by Rachel and a hitman named Santos. Bennett explains that BioPrime has been bribing anyone who questions their dirty deeds, but before he can share more, Santos stabs him dead, then stabs Ray and knocks out Rachel, leaving them both on the platform.",
        "Two years later, Ray has been obsessively tracking Keeley's movements and BioPrime's activities. He infiltrates BioPrime's charity auction, where Keeley is the keynote speaker, and threatens him. Keeley tells him that BioPrime's chairman, Vinod Shah, is behind all the corruption. In the brutal fight that follows, Ray kills a bodyguard and strangles Keeley to death. He then flees with Rachel and they hide in a motel outside of town. Rachel, concerned that her father has gone too far, contacts FBI Agent Sarah Meeker and tries to convince her to look into BioPrime's misdeeds. Two mercenaries slip into the motel to attack them, but Ray sets a trap and kills them both. He then sets up an ambush in a bridge to attack the heavily guarded Shah's convoy but Santos appears and shoots Shah dead, causing Ray and Rachel to flee.",
        "The pair tracks Santos to a diner, where they have a parley. Santos, who experienced persecution from an oppressive government in his homeland as a child, admits that he is sympathetic to Ray's cause. He agrees to a temporary truce and reveals that Congresswoman Diana Morgan is his employer, giving Ray a lead on her location, but warns that the next time they meet, he will kill them.",
        "Returning to the city, Ray is pursued by the FBI and flees to the roof of PNC Park. As Meeker tries to talk him down, it is revealed that \"Ray\" is actually Rachel. Ray had died from his wounds at the subway two years ago. Rachel, suffering from PTSD and dissociative identity disorder, has devoted herself to avenging her parents' death, as she is broken after losing both her parents several months apart. She jumps into the Allegheny River but is retrieved by the FBI, restrained, and put in an ambulance. After breaking free, she locates Morgan's campaign office, where Santos attacks her. After another brutal fight, she stabs Santos to death.",
        "She confronts Morgan and coerces a confession out of the Congresswoman admitting she was bribed by BioPrime for government contracts and had ordered the hit on Bennett and Ray. Rachel flees and sends the recording to the FBI. In the aftermath, Morgan is arrested for her crimes, while Rachel obtains a fake passport, exchanges her money for cryptocurrency, and boards a plane to a brighter future."

    "Reception": [
        "On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 24% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Burdened with action clich\u00e9s and tripped up by a late plot twist, Sweet Girl wastes a potentially resonant story and some solid work from its well-matched leads.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "Frank Scheck, the film critic for Hollywood Reporter, praises the way the director \"handles the nonstop action efficiently and makes excellent use of the extensive Pittsburgh locations\", but he criticizes the way the movie \u201cdegenerates into a mindless series of ultraviolent hand-to-hand combat sequences\" which strain credibility.",
        "Craig D. Lindsey, film reviewer for AV Club, calls the movie a \u201cbig, clunky throwback to \u201990s cinema\u201d about an \u201cadult-and-child-on-the-lam.\u201d Lindsey says that the movie is a \u201cpredictable and preposterous\u201d star vehicle for Momoa.",
        "Paul Byrnes, the film critic for the Sydney Morning Herald, criticized the film's script, plot holes, and its \"pernicious\" conspiracy theory message about seeking revenge against the powerful forces in society are all colluding together.",
        "Matt Zoller Seitz, a film reviewer for RogerEbert.com, calls it a \"sprawling, bruising, sometimes convoluted, often emotionally exhausting drama with action sequences stitched into it\". Seitz states that the movie is \"...too long and disorganized, and often just too much, for its own good\", as it attempts to blend five or six 1990s and 2000s blockbuster plots in one film.",
        "David Lewis,  the film critic for the San Francisco  Chronicle, calls the film \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cfarfetched\u201d and states that it \u201cstrains credibility at almost every turn.\u201d Lewis  states that the characters are \u201cscantly developed\u201d and he notes that the \u201cstory could have used a tad more subtlety.\u201d",
        "The Guardian's Benjamin Lee states that it is \u201cadmirable\u201d that a mass market film like this criticizes the \u201camoral practices of big pharma\u201d and the challenges that poor Americans have accessing health care. While Lee praises this \u201csurprisingly substantive starting point\u201d, he states that the \u201cthinly etched topicality\u201d of the script  \u201conly gets the film so far.\u201d Lee states that the twist in the film is \u201cutterly nonsensical\u201d and causes the film to become a \u201cbizarro fantasy\u201d and an \u201cungainly mess\u201d."
