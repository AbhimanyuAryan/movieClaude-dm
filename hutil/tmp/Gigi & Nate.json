The film is loosely based on an organisation which paired monkeys with disabled people to provide help.[2] The film was released in the United States on September 2, 2022, by Roadside Attractions.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nNate Gibson collapses shortly after diving into a lake at his family's Fourth of July weekend party in their summer place in the fictional town of Happy Days, North Carolina. Rushing him to a local hospital, he is in such bad condition that his mother, Claire, insists that he be airlifted to one in Nashville, Tennessee. \nThere, they diagnose Nate with meningitis and the family is told his condition is likely terminal. His brain is swelling, causing him to have constant seizures. His big sister Katy sternly tells him he does not have permission to die. \nFour years later, still living in Nashville, Nate has survived but is quadripalegic. He falls into a deep depression and tries to commit suicide. Claire contacts Cebus, an organization that trains animals to be service animals. They give Nate a capuchin named Gigi as an emotional support animal. She was rescued from a California petting zoo. \nAt the Gibsons' Gigi quickly accepts her new living space, but takes longer to come out and interact physically with Nate. Katy comes home from college and disapproves. The family dog Banjo gets loose, chasing Gigi and leaving the house a complete mess.\nNate overhears Claire and his dad Dan argue over him and Gigi, so he says they might as well return her. To the surprise of Nate's caretakers, Gigi starts to help Nate with his rehabilitation exercises, giving him a pick-me-up. \nAs Gigi starts to accompany Nate on excursions into town, a local animal rights activists takes video footage of Gigi and Nate together at a local grocery store. Then he meets Lori again, the young woman he'd met the day he'd contracted meningitis. She invites them both to a college drinking party, and as he has a large Instagram following, a video taken there becomes public.\nThe animal rights group Americans For Animal Protection (AFAP) hold a protest outside the Gibsons' home, threatening to fight to make it illegal for capuchins to become service animals. They are granted a hearing to propose the ban. Despite Nate speaking up for the primates, the ruling goes in favor of AFAP 2\u20131, forcing him to give up Gigi. \nAs Nate's mother throws out Gigi's cage, his grandmother finds an article about North Carolina allowing capuchins as service animals. So, the family opts to move back there. A year later, during a Fourth of July barbecue at their new home, Nate reveals that he got a full-ride acceptance to a college that will allow him to use Gigi as his service animal.\n\nCast[edit]\nCharlie Rowe as Nate Gibson\nMarcia Gay Harden as Claire, Nate's mother\nJosephine Langford as Katy, Nate's older sister\nHannah Alligood as Annabelle, Nate's younger sister\nJim Belushi as Dan, Nate's father\nDiane Ladd as Nate's grandmother\nZoe Colletti as Lori\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography for Gigi & Nate began on March 29, 2021, in Los Angeles.[3] In May 2021, it was reported that filming also took place in North Carolina and that Marcia Gay Harden, Charlie Rowe, Josephine Langford, Zoe Colletti, Hannah Alligood, Jim Belushi, and Diane Ladd would star.[4] Filming concluded on May 29, 2021.[3] The film was released on September 2, 2022.\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe film was released alongside Honk for Jesus.
