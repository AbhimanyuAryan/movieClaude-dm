The land is drought-stricken and dust storms plague the country. When Eugene is five years old, his father abandons his family. Eugene lives his days stealing dime novels with his buddy Joe, fantasizing of another life. His mother remarried a lawman, George Evans, who does his best to act as a father figure to Eugene and his younger sister Phoebe.\nOne day, a town meeting takes place and the sheriff shows a wanted poster of Allison Wells, who is wanted for $10,000 for bank robbing and murder. Eugene and Joe intend to search for her. George tells Eugene to take responsibility and look for work. Later, Eugene sneaks to the barn to read. He notices bandages and a woman pointing a revolver at him. Recognising her as Allison from the wanted poster, Eugene and Allison make a deal. He cleans her wounds and, in return, Allison will tell him what happened.\nTo gain Eugene's trust, Allison gives him the revolver. She explains that when she was robbing a bank, the police took no issue firing into an innocent crowd and a stray bullet killed a young girl. Shocked by the death, Allison was shot in the leg before speeding off in a car. Alison tells Eugene that she will give him $20,000 if he helps her get a vehicle to Mexico. Eugene agrees.\nPhoebe sees Eugene spying on Allison and asks him what he's looking at. He tells her there are dead dogs in the barn. She doesn't believe him and goes into the barn, as Allison hides in fear, but runs out after the barn door slams loudly. Eugene tells Joe that he has met someone offering them money for Joe's family's car. Joe denies the request.\nReturning to the barn Eugene finds an anxious Allison who claims she is feeling cooped up and needs to get out of the area. Eugene takes her swimming at a local watering hole. Almost being caught by the property owner, the two take off back to the farm.\nAt the town dance, Eugene overhears George mentioning evidence against Allison at the police station. Stealing his stepfather's keys, Eugene breaks into the evidence room and discovers photographs of the crime scene. He discovers Alison had lied and failed to mention her accomplice, Perry, who killed people. While running from the police both were shot and Perry died. Eugene confronts Allison, claiming she lied to him.\nGeorge discovers a torn cloth from Allison\u2019s dress and takes it to the sheriff as proof of her being in the area. The sheriff fires George, believing he gave Eugene the keys to gain evidence which Eugene burned. George drives back to the farm. George confronts Eugene, telling him they may lose their home.\nEugene and Allison leave town in the family truck. Allison believes Eugene came because he loves her and tells him she does not love him in return and intended to go alone. Eugene reminds her that his father is in Mexico and this is his chance to find him. They stop at a hotel. Allison takes a shower and invites Eugene in, leading to them having sex.\nThe following morning, in need of money, they rob a bank. Eugene holds the customers hostage as Allison raids the tellers. One hostage takes advantage of a brief hesitation and takes aim at Allison. Eugene fires one shot into the man's head, killing him. They make their getaway.\nDriving down the road, Eugene, wracked with guilt, insists they pull over. They do and Allison pleads with him to get back in the car, while he walks away into the woods. George and a small posse are on their trail, with Eugene's sister Phoebe hidden in the back seat. Allison and Eugene both admit their wrongdoings to each other. Allison embraces him and tells him they can baptize themselves in the ocean and begin a new life together.\nAs they run back to the car, George fires a shot, hitting Allison. As she lies dying, Eugene kneels with her. George tells his men to lay down their weapons as Eugene fires a shot into George's leg. George tells his men not to fire at Eugene. Phoebe yells at him to run. Eugene hurries to the truck and quickly speeds off. Phoebe, narrating the entire story, says the family never saw Eugene again, though she is keeping his legend alive.\n\nCast[edit]\nFinn Cole as Eugene Evans\nMargot Robbie as Allison Wells\nTravis Fimmel as George Evans\nGarrett Hedlund as Perry Montroy (special participation)\nKerry Condon as Olivia Evans\nDarby Camp as Phoebe Evans\nLola Kirke as older Phoebe Evans, also The Narrator[4]\nStephen Dinh as Joe Garza\nProduction[edit]\nIn May 2017, Margot Robbie joined the cast of the film, with Miles Joris-Peyrafitte directing from a screenplay by Nicolaas Zwart.
