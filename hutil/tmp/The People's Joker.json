The film premiered on September 13, 2022, at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, but planned screenings of the film were canceled due to \"rights issues\".[1] The film unofficially parodies characters from the Batman comics, and the main character is a transgender woman based on the Joker, played by Drew. The film also features Scott Aukerman, Tim Heidecker, Maria Bamford, David Liebe Hart, Robert Wuhl, and Bob Odenkirk in supporting roles.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn a dystopian world monitored by Batman, a young child grows up in Smallville, Kansas idolizing the performers on a sketch comedy program, UCB Live. The unnamed protagonist's mother is disturbed when her child asks, \"Was I born in the wrong body?\" and immediately books a session with Dr. Crane of Arkham Asylum, who prescribes Smylex: a drug that forces its users to put on a happy face, even if they feel depression, anxiety, or gender dysphoria.\nFifteen years later, our hero has grown up and moves to Gotham City to join the cast of UCB Live, where a computer designates him a male Joker, who will be allowed to have an individual identity in the cast, unlike the women, who are all assigned to be nameless Harlequins that serve as back-up dancers. The process to become on-air talent includes paying $15,000 and enduring improv comedy classes from UCB cast member Ra's al\u00a0Ghul. The hero strikes up a friendship with Oswald Cobblepot, another struggling comedian who cannot afford the entrance fee and the duo decide that they will instead make their own comedy troupe. To avoid rules that outlaw unapproved humor, they will call their act \"anti-comedy\".\nThey set up in an abandoned warehouse at a dilapidated carnival and are quickly joined by a number of law-breaking comedians with their own deliberately unfunny and uncomfortable acts. One of these is Jason \"Mr.\u00a0J\" Todd, who dresses as a Joker of his own and tells Marxist observational humor. Mr.\u00a0J and the hero immediately strike up a bond and go on a date that includes Mr.\u00a0J's revelation that he is a transgender man who recently left an abusive relationship. This helps encourage the protagonist to articulate that she is a transgender woman and the two plot to have her dive into a vat of estrogen to gender transition.\nAs the duo evade guards at the chemical plant, a retired Batman appears to stop them and it leaves Mr.\u00a0J shaken. While the protagonist finally feels happy for the first time after emerging from the chemicals, Mr.\u00a0J reveals that his ex is Batman. The crimefighter adopted orphan Carrie Kelley and trained her to be his sidekick Robin, even assisting with a gender transition to the identity of Jason Todd, but their relationship became toxic and sexual, in spite of their large age difference and the fact that Batman was a father figure to the seventeen year old.\nBatman continues to make public appearances, participating in a reality dating show contest, masquerading as a straight man and even hosting UCB Live, enraging Jason, who manages to make every event about him. His partner has now taken the name of Joker the Harlequin: a woman with a comedic identity of her own who is trying to be happy but is stuck in the abusive and self-sabotaging patterns of Mr.\u00a0J. When Joker's mother comes to visit and explain that she wants to apologize for how she raised her child, it comes at a  time when Joker is breaking up with Mr.\u00a0J and decides to finally take on the comedy establishment by hacking into a broadcast of UCB Live, daring producer Lorne Michaels to let her host instead of Batman.\nMichaels agrees, seeing it as a way to get good ratings. Batman tries to intervene, but the entire anti-comedy troupe fights him off, with Pamela Isley's enormous venus flytrap eating Batman. Joker manages to make peace with Mr.\u00a0J before setting out for a grueling day-long training session with Ra's, who reveals that there is a prophecy of a people's hero who can liberate comedy from its constraints and believes it to be Joker the Harlequin.\nOn the night of the show, Michaels pumps Smylex into the crowd to ensure that they laugh no matter what Joker says and she finally has a moment of \"supersanity\" where she understands what she needs to be happy and how it cannot come from validation from outsiders. She materializes in the Fifth Dimension alongside the powerful Mx.\u00a0Mxyzptlk who offers to rearrange the time stream for Joker. She asks that her old friend Oswald be given the fame and power of Batman and to have one happy memory from childhood: she has a vision of 1992, riding in the car with mom, as they sing along to \"The Joker\" and laugh.\nAfter the credits, we are told that Joker will return in The People's Nightmare: Freddy vs Joker and the glove of Freddy Krueger appears on screen.[1][2]\n\nCast[edit]\nVera Drew as Joker the Harlequin/Vera, a trans woman from Smallville trying to break into the world of stand-up comedy.\nGriffin Kramer as a young, pre-transition Vera, whose deadname is bleeped.\nLynn Downey as Vera's mother\nKane Distler as Mr. J, an emotionally manipulative trans man who is a composite of Jason Todd and the Jared Leto incarnation of the Joker from Suicide Squad.\nNathan Faustyn as The Penguin, Joker's slacker friend and another aspiring comedian.\nDavid Liebe Hart as Ra's al Ghul, the emcee of UCB, Gotham City's only comedy showcase.\nPhil Braun as Batman, a closeted gay man with far-right politics, who was Mr. J's abuser.\nMaria Bamford as Lorne Michaels, the controlling producer of UCB. Saturday Night Live star Sarah Sherman originally voiced the role but asked to be recast following the Toronto Film Festival premiere.\nChristian Calloway as Dr. Jonathan Crane, who prescribes the young Vera with Smylex, an ineffective antidepressant with grotesque side effects.\nTrevor Drinkwater as The Riddler, another aspiring comedian.\nRuin Carroll as Poison Ivy, a non-binary aspiring comedian.\nTim Heidecker as Perry White, a belligerent Alex Jones-style political commentator.\nScott Aukerman as Mr. Freeze\nBob Odenkirk as Bob the Goon\nArden Hughes as the UCB Computer\nRobert Wuhl as himself, an actor in superhero films appearing via a Cameo\nAlec Robbins as Mr. Boop\nCricket Arrison as the Creeper. Film critic/bartender Mike Vanderbilt originally appeared as The Creeper in early versions of the film but was recast after sexual assault allegations were made against him.[3]\nMia Moore Marchant as The Huntress\nEmber Knight as Mxy\nSandy Honig as Mr. Boop\u2019s Wife\nEliot Glazer as Lil Timmy Too Times\nDenali Winter as Clark Kent\nBambi Belle as Lois Lane\nRome L. Davis as the Social Worker\nProduction[edit]\nIn late 2019, co-writer Bri LeRose encouraged Vera Drew to re-edit the film Joker. While working on the re-edit, Drew began to think about how the characters reflected her own life, stating \"I knew I needed to do some sort of big creative project around gender, comedy, and mom issues\".[4][5] Drew originally planned to re-edit \"every single Batman movie\" along with other films to make the film,[4] but those scenes were later edited out.[6] Drew crowdsourced both the budget for the production and the artwork; more than 100 artists provided backdrops and character animation for the film.[4] In the process, the final film became a coming-of-age story[7] and not merely a parody pastiche.\n\nRelease[edit]\nAccording to Drew, \"a media conglomerate\" sent her \"an angry letter (misreported as a 'cease and desist') pressuring to not screen\" shortly before the premiere.[8][5] Some media outlets assumed this to be Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company to DC Comics, but neither Drew nor Warner Bros. have confirmed this.[1][9]\nOn September 14, 2022, a day after the film had premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, subsequent screenings of the film were canceled. The website for TIFF stated, \"The filmmaker has withdrawn this film due to rights issues\".[10] The film has attempted to receive copyright exemption under fair use for being a parody,[7][11][12] and a title card displayed before the film began stated \"Any copyright or trademark infringement was not done intentionally\", among other things.[9] In a statement to Variety, Drew said: \"We\u2019re looking for buyers and distribution partners who will protect us and make this film accessible to trans people and their families everywhere\".[9]\nOn September 21, Drew also pulled the film from other film festivals where it had been slated to screen, although it was unclear whether this was motivated by another copyright infringement threat or simply to help the film gain a distribution deal.[13]\nThe first American showing occurred for the 2023 Outfest film festival in Los\u00a0Angeles on July\u00a015, 2023.[14]\nThe People's Joker was released theatrically in the United States on April\u00a05, 2024.[15]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 64 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The People's Joker uses classic characters in impressively inventive ways, working within a familiar framework to tell an invigorating story of self-acceptance.\"[16] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[17]\nPeter Debruge of Variety described the film as \"reflect[ing] the deliberately outrageous, ironically distanced variety found in internet memes and Adult Swim series\" and as \"using millennial meta-irony ... to critique the institutions [Drew] once held dear\".[18] Katie Rife of Polygon stated, \"in an age where corporate IP has become a de facto religion in global cinema culture, The People\u2019s Joker is a blasphemous Molotov cocktail of a movie, with a unique and valuable point of view. And it\u2019s hilarious, too\".[1] Jude Dry of IndieWire gave it a B+ and wrote: \"Underneath the satirical madness lies a genuinely moving story of self-acceptance, self-love, and the inspiring act of an artist stepping into her power. All jokes aside, the people deserve to see it.\"[19]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Rife, Katie (September 14, 2022). \"Trans parody The People's Joker shut down over 'rights issues'\". Polygon.
