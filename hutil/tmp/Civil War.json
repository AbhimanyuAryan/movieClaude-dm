    "Plot": [
        "A civil war has erupted between an authoritarian United States government and various regional forces. Renowned war photographer Lee Smith saves aspiring photojournalist Jessie from a suicide bombing in New York City.",
        "Lee and her colleague Joel intend to travel to Washington, D.C., to interview and photograph the president, who is serving a third term, before the city falls. Their mentor Sammy asks to come as far as Charlottesville, where the Western Forces (\"WF\") of Texas and California are assembling. Despite Lee's hesitance, she and Joel agree. Unbenownst to Lee, Jessie also convinces Joel to take her with them as well.",
        "After departing the city, the group stops at a rural gas station protected by armed men. Lee successfully negotiates a purchase of fuel with Canadian dollars. Meanwhile, Jessie wanders off to a nearby car wash she saw from the road. There she finds two men being tortured by the owners, who claim that the men are looters. One owner follows Jessie, but Lee defuses the situation by taking a photo of the man posed with his victims. After leaving, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos.",
        "Following an overnight stop close to ongoing fighting, the group document the combat the next day as militiamen assault a building held by loyalists. Lee sees Jessie's potential as a war photographer while Jessie takes photographs of the militia executing captured loyalist soldiers.",
        "Continuing on, the group spend the night at a refugee camp before passing through a small town where, under watchful guard, residents attempt to live in blissful ignorance. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a local shop.",
        "Later, they are pinned down in a sniper battle near an amusement park. The snipers they are with tell Joel that they and the sniper in a nearby house are simply trying to kill each other, without any indication of who is on which side of the war.",
        "Jessie's nerve builds and her photography skills improve as she witnesses several deaths, and she develops a mentorship under Lee. Jessie asks if Lee would photograph Jessie being killed, and Lee indicates that she might.",
        "While driving, the foursome encounter two other reporters they know, Tony and Bohai. Tony and Jessie playfully switch cars, only for Bohai and Jessie's car to be captured by a militia group who have been executing civilians and dumping them in a mass grave. The rest of the group tries to intervene, but a xenophobic militant kills Bohai and then asks where the others are from, killing Tony when he says Hong Kong. Sammy saves the group by running over two of the militants, but is shot by a third and dies as they flee.",
        "Arriving at the Western Forces military camp in Charlottesville, the group grieves in different ways. Lee takes a photo of Sammy's corpse, but deletes it shortly after. Joel gets drunk and begins to become hysterical. Jessie floats around the campsite. Two fellow reporters inform the group that the government's defenders have mostly surrendered, leaving Washington, D.C., largely unprotected. They follow the WF as Jessie's photography becomes increasingly risky, while Lee has a brief post-traumatic stress disorder episode and is unable to take pictures.",
        "In the besieged capital, Lee sees the president's limousine flee the White House grounds with escort, but intuits that the president is still in the White House and leads her group inside. The WF breach the building and face off with the remaining United States Secret Service. When Jessie exposes herself to gunfire to get a photo of the ensuing gunfight outside the Oval Office, Lee pushes her to safety. Jessie photographs her mentor as she is killed in the crossfire.",
        "The WF soldiers find the president hiding in the Oval Office. Joel tells them to stop so that he can get a quote from the President. The president begs Joel for mercy, a quote with which Joel is satisfied. Jessie takes a photo of the president's summary execution. During the credits, a developing photo of smiling WF soldiers posing with the president's corpse appears."

        "In January 2022, it was reported that Alex Garland had signed on to write and direct the film for A24, with Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson and Cailee Spaeny to star. In April, Karl Glusman was announced as part of the cast. In a May interview with The Daily Telegraph, Garland described the film as a companion piece to his 2022 film Men, and said it is \"set at an indeterminate point in the future\u2013just far enough ahead for me to add a conceit\u2014and serves as a sci-fi allegory for our currently polarized predicament\". In the same interview, Sonoya Mizuno was revealed as part of the cast, having appeared in all of Garland's previous films.",
        "Principal photography began in Atlanta on March 15, 2022. By May, production had moved to London. The production budget for Civil War was $50 million, making it A24's most expensive film. The movie was shot on the prosumer DJI Ronin 4D camera.",
        "In a March 2024 interview with The Guardian, Garland stated that after Civil War, he intends to step back from directing and focus only on writing."

    "Reception": [
        "In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $18\u201324 million from 3,838 theaters (the widest-ever R-rated release by an independent studio) in its opening weekend. The film made $10.8 million on its first day, including $2.9 million from Thursday night previews (a record for an A24 release). It went on to debut to $25.7 million, surpassing Hereditary as the biggest opening weekend in A24's history as well as the studio's first film to top the box office. The opening weekend audience skewed male at 63%, while 57% of attendees were between ages 18\u201334. IMAX contributed over 16% of the opening weekend gross, with the main reasons given for seeing the film being its subject matter, the action, and a general interest in indie films (each grouping made up a third of the audience, with the former narrowly higher). The Hollywood Reporter reported that ticket buyers were equally Converative and Liberal, while Deadline wrote that 52% were left-wing (22% Liberal, 19% Democrats, and 11% moderate) and 17% were right-wing.",
        "Following the SXSW premiere, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes noted that critics called the film \"a gorgeously shot cautionary tale full of big ideas and a fantastic performance by Kirsten Dunst, but it may surprise some viewers\". Critics praised the \"beauty and intensity of the dystopian drama\", while noting its \"potential for controversy and disappointment\" due to the effectiveness of its messages. On the site, 82% of 272 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Tough and unsettling by design, Civil War is a gripping close-up look at the violent uncertainty of life in a nation in crisis.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 76% overall positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "In a positive review, Peter Debruge of Variety wrote: \"Garland's the last person to suggest a group hug. As statements go, his powerful vision leaves us shaken, effectively repeating the question that quelled the L.A. riots: Can we all get along?\" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph awarded the movie five stars out of five, writing: \"The Ex Machina director's vision of an imploding America is neither anti-Trump nor anti-woke. Instead it's as riveting as cinema gets.\" Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com, compared Civil War to films about \"Western journalists covering the collapse of foreign countries\", such as The Year of Living Dangerously and Welcome to Sarajevo, ultimately praising the film as \"furiously convincing and disturbing\".",
        "Lovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review, writing: \"With the precision and length of its violent battle sequences, it's clear Civil War operates as a clarion call. Garland wrote the film in 2020 as he watched cogs on America's self-mythologizing exceptionalist machine turn, propelling the nation into a nightmare. With this latest film, he sounds the alarm, wondering less about how a country walks blindly into its own destruction and more about what happens when it does.\"",
        "Valerie Complex of Deadline Hollywood offered negative comments, saying: \"The script's utilization of characters of color as conduits for brutality needed to be explored further. ... Ultimately, Civil War feels like a missed opportunity. The director's vision of a fractured America, embroiled in conflict, holds the potential for introspection on our current societal divisions. However, the film's execution, hampered by thin characterization, a lackluster narrative and an overreliance on spectacle over substance, left me disengaged.\"",
        "Johnny Oleksinski of the New York Post observed: \"Civil War's shtick is that it's not specifically political. For instance, as the US devolves into enemy groups of secessionist states, Texas and California have banded together to form the Western Forces. That such an alliance could ever occur is about as likely as Sweetgreen/Kentucky Fried Chicken combo restaurant.\"",
        "Stephanie Zacharek of Time observed: \"Civil War has the vibe of your standard desolate zombie movie with a modern American backdrop, but it's far less effective than your average George A. Romero project: sometimes a B movie with a sense of humor about itself says more about a nation's despair than an overserious, breast-beating one. ... Do we really need a movie to invent, and rub our noses in, the possibility of a bleaker future?\""
