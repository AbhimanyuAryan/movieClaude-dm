    "Plot": [
        "A wild mustang narrates her life from birth, born free within the Onaqui Mountains of Utah. She explains that her mother taught that when horses pass away, they fly into the sky to rest among the stars. One day, the mustang draws the attention of some cowboys, who wrangle her herd; she never sees her mother again. A horse trainer named John Manly purchases the mustang and takes her to Birtwick, a horse sanctuary. While she likes John, the mustang refuses to cooperate, but John remains patient. The mustang befriends two other horses named Ginger and Merrylegs.",
        "John is informed that his sister and her husband died in a car accident, leaving him to care for his niece, Jo Green. Jo wants nothing to do with John but becomes entranced with the difficult mustang. Eventually, the mustang recognizes Jo's pain as similar to her own, and they connect. Jo tames the mustang and names her Black Beauty, or Beauty for short. John gets through to Jo by having her work in the stables and tend to Beauty. They popularize the phrase \"partnering\" a horse as opposed to \"breaking\" a horse. John informs Jo that they will eventually have to sell Beauty, but Jo refuses.",
        "One night, a fire breaks out when a stablehand doesn\u2019t turn off a heater, and the horses are evacuated. With Birtwick losing money, Jo is concerned that Beauty will be sold but works out a deal with John's boss, Henry Gordon, so that she can work extra to earn the money to buy Beauty. The upperclass Winthorp family who are migrants from England arrive to purchase horses for their estate with the daughter Georgina immediately choosing Beauty to be leased. John convinces them to have Jo come along as her tenant. At the Earlshall estate, Beauty learns that her friend Ginger was purchased for the Winthorp's son George, who unlike Georgina, is kind and takes an interest in Jo.",
        "Georgina is cruel and rude to Beauty, who resists the urge to harm her as it would get her and Jo in trouble. A race is held at a social gathering where Georgina's poor riding results in Beauty injuring a leg. George stands up to his mother, and the Winthorps return Beauty. However, John informs Jo that Birtwick is closing and all the horses have to be sold. Beauty is taken away without Jo getting a chance to say goodbye. She becomes determined to find and buy her again.",
        "Beauty is sold to a ranger named Terry, and they go on rescue missions in the wilderness. Eventually Terry retires, and Beauty is given to a farmer who uses old tools, forcing her to work harder. Then she is sold to a kind carriage driver in New York City whose daughter names her Lady. One night, Beauty is reunited with Ginger, who had been sold without George's knowledge, but she dies shortly afterwards.",
        "When Jerry gets sick, Beauty is sold to another carriage company, which treats its horses cruelly and engages in illegal horse trading. While out driving, Beauty spots Ginger's body being taken away. Heartbroken, Beauty sits on the road during her carriage rotation, which draws media attention. The company attempts to sell Beauty, but a kind stable boy named Manuel alerts the police of the company's illegal activities. Jo finds Beauty and reunites with her. Jo reveals that she has rebuilt Birtwick and works with John and George, now her husband, to rehabilitate horses; she even finds that Merrylegs was also recovered. Beauty lives with Jo for the rest of her days."

    "Reception": [
        "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 48% based on 46 reviews, with a mixed-to-positive rating of 5.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Unable to rein in the complexities of its source material, Black Beauty struggles to gallop out of the paddock.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".",
        "Fionnuala Halligan of Screen Daily found the movie to be a solid reinterpretation of Anna Sewell's novel, complimented the performances of the actors, and praised the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Mackenzie Foy's characters, saying, \"Like Anna Sewell\u2019s original novel, this film\u2019s heart is very much in the right place.\" Amy Amatangelo of\u00a0Paste rated the film 7.8 out of 10, saying, \"The movie looks stunning with sweeping landscapes and gorgeous shots of Beauty in action, as South Africa makes a lovely stand-in for both the American West and New York. An inspiring movie for young, old and everyone in between, I would be shocked if the movie\u2019s final moments didn\u2019t lead to a cathartic cry for every viewer. The beauty of this story is timeless.\" Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media rated the movie 3 out of 5 stars, praised the depiction of positive messages and role models, writing, \"Black Beauty is emotionally taxing, with the central horse suffering abuse, loss, and danger. - That said, the film, told mostly from the horse's perspective, ultimately shows a clear respect and admiration for the animals, and it conveys positive messages of loyalty, family, perseverance, resilience.\"",
        "Kayti Burt of Den of Geek rated the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, praised Ashley Avis' direction, writing, \"Ashley Avis hits all the plot points and throws in some fantastically pretty shots in the process, yet there is a lack of texture (both visually and narratively) that keeps this film from graduating from serviceable horse-girl film to something greater both within and outside the limits of Horse Girl Canon\" and that the movie \"lacks the thematic ambition of its source material, but is a serviceable addition to Horse Girl Canon.\" Sara Stewart of the New York Post rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \"One of the purposes of the book was to shine a line on animal cruelty, which is admirable \u2014 but Black Beauty veers so often into the dark and the sad I question how much appeal it'll really have for the younger set. Still, if your tear ducts need cleaning, this is one holiday film that\u2019ll get the job done.\" Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com rated the movie 2 out of 4 stars, claiming, \"Avis\u2019 film clearly adores its four-legged subjects. Through David Procter's cinematography, she recreates the look and feel of one of Disney's nature documentaries for the first moments of Black Beauty's life. It's a golden-hour, idealized look at a herd of horses galloping through fields and in the shadows of mountains. [...] It's a narrative choice that may work better for some than others, and it probably won't ride well with devotees of the book.\""
