It stars Thomas Haden Church and Dianna Agron.\nHaden Church plays Lloyd, a reclusive man who is tracked down by his daughter Maggie, played by Agron, after a decade apart to tell him some important news. His UFO obsession makes communication hard.[1]\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nLloyd is a reclusive man who lives in a home in the middle of nowhere searching for UFOs. He is estranged from his daughter Maggie and has been given the nickname \"Acidman\" by the locals. One day his daughter Maggie arrives, having painstakingly tracked him down in order to visit with him and pass along some important news. The two find it difficult to talk to one another, at times relying on outside elements such as childhood toys or Lloyd's dog Migo to fuel the conversation along. It's when Maggie travels with Lloyd to search for UFOs that night that she realizes how much his mental health has deteriorated.\n\nCast[edit]\nDianna Agron as Maggie\nThomas Haden Church as Lloyd\nSameerah Luqmaan-Harris\nRelease[edit]\nAcidman premiered at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in the Spotlight section[2] on June 10, 2022.[3] In February 2023, Brainstorm Media acquired distribution rights and scheduled the film to be released on March 31, 2023.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 33 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10.[5] IndieWire and Shockya both reviewed the film,[6] the former praising Haden Church's performance.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kay, Jeremy (June 8, 2022). \"Ten acquisition titles to look out for at Tribeca 2022\".
