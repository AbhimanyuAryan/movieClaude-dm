    "Plot": [
        "Mason Pettits is a former U.S. Army Special Forces operator, who was injured and medically discharged after a failed mission to assassinate Juan Venegas, the dictator of the South American country of Paldonia. After being discharged, Pettits works as a lawyer, a job he despises. One day, Mason is approached by his former team member, Sebastian Earle, who offers him a highly paid private security job where he has to protect disgraced journalist Claire Wellington as she goes to Paldonia to interview Venegas. The mission upsets his wife Jenny, who doesn't want their daughter Casey to live without a father, should something happen.",
        "After arriving in Paldonia and meeting Venegas, they are ambushed by a militant group that tries to kill Venegas, destroying their vehicles in the process. Mason fights off the assailants and they escape into the jungle. Venegas deduces that their attackers were his own soldiers, and that the assassination attempt is actually a coup orchestrated by his nephew Jorge, who is working with a South African mercenary named Colonel Jan Koehorst to kill him. Mason tries to leave Venegas behind while bringing Claire with him, but the two are ambushed by mercenaries. Mason, with a little help from Venegas, fights them off, and the group arrives at a village where Venegas is highly respected.",
        "Claire successfully films her interview with Venegas. While Mason bonds further with Claire, he is unable to start a relationship with her despite her advances, remembering his family back home. The next day, Venegas hints at a real purpose for Mason's job - Mason calls Sebastian, who informs him that he was actually hired to kill Venegas. Jan and his men subsequently arrive at the village and chase the group; Mason and Venegas manage to escape while Claire is captured.",
        "While on the way to Paldonia's capital, Venegas reveals that he wasn't responsible for killing Mason's friends during their mission. Later, the two stage a trade with Claire, while Venegas reveals that the revolution against his regime is actually controlled opposition. The next day, during said trade, Venegas brings in revolutionary protestors to distract Jan as he, Mason, and Claire run to the presidental palace. There, Venegas convinces Jorge to help him lead the country better, but the latter is killed when General Mart\u00ednez, another conspirator, tries to shoot Venegas.",
        "Jan and his men arrive at the palace, and a shootout ensues between them and Venegas' palace guards, during which Mason fights Jan alone. Jan reveals that he was responsible for killing Mason's crew. Claire, who films the battle, helps Mason defeat Jan. Afterwards, Sebastian and his team arrive and fight Jan's militants.",
        "Some time later, Claire has regained fame for her footage in Paldonia, Venegas resigns from being dictator, and Mason reunites with his family before being gifted $5 million by Venegas. Now with a newfound purpose on his life, Mason decides to spend more time with his family."
