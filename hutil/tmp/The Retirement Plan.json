Following her husband's capture, Ashley and her young daughter, Sarah, must seek out Ashley's estranged widowed father, Matt, for help. Unable to buy a ticket for both of them, Ashley sends Sarah alone to her grandfather. Sarah finds Matt, who is living the life of a retired beach bum in the Cayman Islands. Soon Ashley is captured and the crime boss, Donnie, realizes that the evidence he is after is in the Cayman Islands. His lieutenant, Bobo, and the \u201cGeneral\u201d are sent to track them down and retrieve the hard drive. Things do not entirely work out as expected. Matt attacks and kills General and Bobo is the sole survivor.  He gets away with Sarah and Matt\u2019s truck. Bobo informs Donny about the situation and Donny advises him to lay low until he can get there. The more time Ashley spends with Matt, she realizes he has a secret past she knew nothing about. Matt reaches out to Drisdale, his handler, to get more information about Donny and his crew.
