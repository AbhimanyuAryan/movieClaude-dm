The website's consensus reads: \"Led by an outstanding Thandiwe Newton, God's Country rewards patient viewers with a slow-burning but ultimately explosive story of inexorable conflict.\"[7] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[8]\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said, \"It's a film that understands both form and content, merging the two in a story that feels less like a piece of suspenseful entertainment and more like a warning.\"[9] Dennis Harvey of Variety said, \"God's Country (the title of which hints at another running theme of faith and doubt) is admirable for avoiding caricature within conflict, and granting dramatic personae the depth to hesitate before giving in to their angriest first impulses.\"[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Printable program guide\" (PDF).
