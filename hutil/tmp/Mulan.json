    "Plot": [
        "In Imperial China, Hua Mulan is an adventurous and active girl, much to the disappointment of her parents Zhou and Li, who hope that one day she will be wed to a good husband. As a young woman, Mulan is arranged to meet with a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. Mulan, flustered, attempts to pour tea in front of the matchmaker, but a spider scares the former's younger sister Xiu, accidentally causing a mishap that destroys the teapot, leading the matchmaker to call her a disgrace in front of her family.",
        "To the north, an imperial outpost is invaded by Rouran warriors, under the leadership of B\u00f6ri Khan. They are assisted by the witch Xianniang, who uses her magic to pose as a surviving soldier and report the attack to the Emperor of China; he then issues a conscription decree ordering every family to contribute one man to fight Khan's forces.",
        "Imperial soldiers arrive in Mulan's village to enlist recruits and Zhou is forced to pledge his service as he has no sons, immediately falling over in front of the soldiers due to his crippled leg. Realizing that her father has no chance of survival, Mulan flees with his armor, horse, and sword to join in his place. Mulan arrives at the training camp, which is run by Commander Tung, an old comrade of Zhou. Alongside dozens of other inexperienced recruits, she ultimately becomes a trained soldier under his tutelage without exposing her true identity.",
        "B\u00f6ri Khan's army continues to advance, forcing Tung to end training early and send his battalion to fight. Mulan chases some troops on her own, but is confronted by Xianniang, who mocks her for pretending to be a man. She attempts to kill Mulan, but her attacks are stopped by the leather with which Mulan's chest had been bound to hide her identity. Mulan removes her male disguise, returning to the battle just as the Rourans begin attacking her fellow troops with a trebuchet. Mulan uses discarded helmets and her archery skills to maneuver the trebuchet into firing on a snowy mountain, triggering an avalanche that buries the Rourans.",
        "Mulan rides back to camp and rescues Chen Honghui, a soldier she befriended in camp. Mulan decides to reveal her gender to Commander Tung, who expels her from the army. On her way home, she is confronted by Xianniang, who reveals that she was also shunned by her people and fights for B\u00f6ri Khan only because he treats her as an equal. Additionally, she reveals that the attacks on the outposts have been a diversion, as B\u00f6ri Khan's true plan is to capture and execute the Emperor for having his father killed. Risking execution, Mulan returns to her battalion to warn them of the impending capture. The soldiers she befriended stand up for her, and Tung decides to believe her, and allows her to lead a unit to the Emperor's palace.",
        "Xianniang uses her magic to take the image of the Imperial Chancellor, and persuades the Emperor to accept B\u00f6ri Khan's challenge to single combat, while removing the city guards from their posts. The guards are murdered, and the Rourans prepare to burn the Emperor alive. Mulan's unit distracts the Rourans while Mulan goes to save the Emperor. B\u00f6ri Khan tries to snipe her with an arrow, but Xianniang, sympathetic to Mulan and disenchanted with the Khan, transforms into a hawk and sacrifices herself by intercepting the arrow. Mulan kills B\u00f6ri Khan, but not before he disarms her and destroys her father's sword. She frees the Emperor, who offers to let her join his personal guard. She declines the offer and returns to her village.",
        "Mulan is reunited with her family. An emissary from the Emperor, under the leadership of Commander Tung, arrives to present Mulan with a new sword, while making a personal request that she join the Imperial Army as an officer."

    "Production": [
        "As early as 2010, Walt Disney Pictures had expressed interest in a live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated film Mulan with international Chinese star Zhang Ziyi, and Chuck Russell chosen as the director. That version of the project never came to fruition.",
        "On March 30, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Disney had restarted development of the live-action adaptation with Chris Bender and J. C. Spink producing, while Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek would be writing the screenplay. On October 4, 2016, it was announced that Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would rewrite the script, combining the Chinese ballad and the 1998 animated film, while Jason T. Reed would be producing the film along with Bender and Jake Weiner. On February 27, 2020, Reed said that Mulan's sidekick from the original film, Mushu, was removed due to the character's negative reception in China. Reed also said that in addition to drawing from the animated movie and the original text, the filmmakers viewed adaptations of Ballad of Mulan produced in China for cinema and television. He stated that since \"[t]he traditional Disney audience and the diaspora Asian audience viewed the movie in one way, and the traditional Chinese in China audience viewed a slightly different way,\" the filmmakers \"dug in to try and make sure that [they are] addressing both of those audiences in a thoughtful way.\"",
        "Several 2010s Hollywood films were accused of whitewashing, and as soon as The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Disney was making a live-action adaptation of the 1998 film, Mulan came under intense scrutiny. An online petition titled \"Tell Disney You Don't Want A Whitewashed Mulan!\" received more than 100,000 signatures. On October 4, 2016, Disney announced that a global search for a Chinese actress to portray the title role was underway. A team of casting directors visited five continents and saw nearly 1,000 candidates for the role with criteria that required credible martial arts skills, the ability to speak clear English, and star quality.",
        "On November 29, 2017, Chinese-American actress Yifei Liu was cast in the film to portray the titular role of Mulan. Many celebrated this as a win for diversity in Disney films. Further cast announcements for Donnie Yen, Gong Li, Jet Li, and Xana Tang were made in April 2018, Utkarsh Ambudkar and Ron Yuan in May, Yoson An and Chum Ehelepola in June, Jason Scott Lee in July, Tzi Ma, Rosalind Chao, Cheng Pei-Pei, Nelson Lee, Jimmy Wong and Doua Moua in August, and Chen Tang in September.",
        "Disney originally sought an Asian director. They first considered Ang Lee, the Taiwanese-born director and two-time Academy Award winner for Best Director. The Hollywood Reporter mentioned that Lee was approached but declined, on October 12, 2016. According to the report, published on November 22, 2016, he said that he would like to see an Asian director leading the film, but he had to decline because he was still obliged to promote his film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. Next, Disney met with Jiang Wen for the position; finally on February 14, 2017, New Zealander Niki Caro was hired as the director of the film, which made Mulan the second Disney film with a female director and a budget above $100 million, following A Wrinkle in Time.",
        "Principal photography began on August 13, 2018, at locations in New Zealand and China and wrapped on November 25, 2018. According to actress Gong Li, the film's production budget was $290\u2013300 million due to the \"massive and\u00a0... unprecedented scale\" of the sets, although the actual figure was later reported to be $200 million. The budget makes Mulan the most expensive film ever directed by a woman.",
        "The visual effects were provided by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Weta Digital, Framestore, and Image Engine. Seth Maury and Anders Langlands served as visual effects supervisors and Sean Andrew Faden served as production supervisor.",
        "Harry Gregson-Williams, who previously worked with Caro on The Zookeeper's Wife, composed the score with additional music by Tom Howe and Stephanie Economou. No songs from the original film were used in the remake, but Caro promised to \"honour the music from the animation in a very significant way.\" Matthew Wilder, the writer of \"Reflection\", which was featured in the animated film, confirmed that the song \"thematically plays a large part in the new movie throughout the score\", and added that \"there's a new version of 'Reflection'\" as well. Christina Aguilera, who had recorded the rendition of \"Reflection\" used in the closing credits of original film, stated during a performance in The Xperience that she had recorded a new version, as well as other material, for the soundtrack of the remake.",
        "\"Loyal Brave True\", performed by Aguilera, written by Jamie Hartman, Harry Gregson-Williams, Rosi Golan and Billy Crabtree, and produced by Hartman, was released as a single from the soundtrack album. The song was also released in Spanish, as \"El Mejor Guerrero\".",
        "The soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on September 4, 2020. A Mandarin version of \"Reflections\", titled \"\u81ea\u5df1\" (Z\u00ecj\u01d0) and performed by Liu, was also included on it."

        "Mulan's world premiere was held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on March 9, 2020. The film was originally scheduled for a November 2, 2018 theatrical release, but was delayed, with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms taking its slot. It was rescheduled for March 27, 2020, before being removed from the release calendar due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film later rescheduled for July 24, 2020, taking the former slot of Jungle Cruise, and then was delayed again to August 21, 2020. On July 23, the film was removed from the release calendar once again.",
        "On August 4, 2020, Disney announced that it was cancelling the film's theatrical release in the United States, and would instead premiere the film on Disney+ with Premier Access for a premium fee on September 4, 2020. Mulan was available for the purchase until November 2, 2020, and was made available for free to all subscribers on December 4. The film was not offered in France as a premium offering, instead releasing to Disney+ subscribers in the country for free at a later date. Speaking about the US$29.99 price point for the film in the United States, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said, \"We're trying to establish a new premiere access window to capture [the] investment we got [in the film]\u00a0... From our research under a premiere access offering, not only does it get us revenue from our original transaction of PVOD, but it's a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+.\" The premium fee was approximately US$26.00 in other countries when considering conversion rates for their native currencies. Unlike other premium VOD releases that feature a 48-hour viewing window, Mulan remains available to renters for as long as they stay subscribed to Disney+.",
        "The film was still released theatrically in countries where theaters had re-opened, and do not have Disney+. In China, the film was released on September 11, 2020.",
        "Mulan received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association, the first Disney live-action remake to be given such a rating.",
        "Mulan was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Digital HD on October 6, 2020, followed by a DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray release on November 10, 2020."

    "Reception": [
        "Variety estimated Mulan would need to be rented by about 8.4 million subscribers (13.8%) in order to break even. On the weekend of the film's release, the Disney+ app was downloaded 68% more than the past weeks' total, similar to the 72% spike upon Hamilton's release that July. Deadline Hollywood reported that industry sources with knowledge of the situation \"are figuring that Disney may not have earned great presales\" and that they could put Mulan on a third-party service before the December release. However, following the film's opening weekend, Business Insider reported it had been viewed by 1.12 million households (only including users renting with TV-connected devices), which would result in $33.5 million in sales for Disney. Yahoo! Finance then reported that, according to analytics research firm 7Park Data, nearly 29% of U.S. Disney+ subscribers that accessed the app from September 1 to 12 purchased Mulan, which in the best-case scenario would result in $261 million for Disney. 7Park Data co-founder Brian Lichtenberger stated Yahoo! Finance overestimated Mulan's revenue, as their figures were for accounts active during that period and not the total subscriber base, and clarified that 10.3% of all accounts purchased the film, with U.S. revenue estimated to be $62\u201393 million; Yahoo! Finance amended their article to reflect this.",
        "According to Nielsen ratings, Mulan was one of the top ten most-watched streams in the United States between August 31 and September 6, 2020. During its opening weekend between September 4\u20136, Mulan drew 525 million streaming minutes in the United States.",
        "In its first weekend of being available on other digital platforms, Mulan was the top-rented film on FandangoNow, and third on both Apple TV and Google Play. In its second weekend in the open market, the film placed second at Fandango, fourth on Google Play, and fifth at Apple TV. In October 2020, The Hollywood Reporter said the film was the most popular PVOD title amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the following month Variety reported the film was the sixth-most watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020 up to that point.",
        "Mulan grossed $5.9 million from nine countries in its international opening weekend, including $1.2 million in Thailand and $700,000 in Singapore, both of which were the highest debuts of 2020 in the respective countries. It also made $800,000 in the United Arab Emirates, and the same amount in Saudi Arabia. In its second weekend, the film made $29.1 million from 17 countries, including $1.8 million in Russia, and finished first in Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and South Africa. Through three weekends, the film grossed $57 million internationally.",
        "The film made $23.2 million on its opening weekend in China, a low figure but a 23% improvement upon Aladdin's debut the year before. Several factors were cited as contributing to the film's muted performance, including the announcement of the official Chinese release date only days before the premiere, giving little chance to build a strong marketing campaign; the prior release on Disney+, resulting in pirated copies being available online; a lack of local press coverage in order to avoid drawing attention to the controversy over the film having been partially shot in the Xinjiang region; and poor fan reception on sites such as Maoyan and Douban. The revenue of the film fell 72% in its second weekend of release in the country, to $6.5 million.",
        "Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 72% of 323 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus read, \"It could have told its classic story with greater depth, but the live-action Mulan is a visual marvel that serves as a stirring update to its animated predecessor.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 52 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".",
        "Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the \"fine cast, exciting action and spectacular visuals\" and writing, \"This is such a great-looking film, with amazing set pieces and dazzling action and colors so vibrant they would dazzle a Crayola factory, it will still play well on your home monitor. There are so many gorgeous shades of orange and magenta, blue and yellow, it's as if we're seeing these colors for the first time.\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a B+, calling it a \"remarkable action epic that carves its own path\" and writing, \"Mulan is perhaps the best example of how to marry the original with something fresh. The Ballad of Mulan has always been an epic-scale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that, a tale that will likely always have resonance.\"",
        "Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ and described it as \"a classic hero(ine)'s tale, exhilarating in its elaborate set pieces and large-scale ambitions even when the smaller human story within it sometimes falls short.\" Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge said, \"On one hand, the result isn't immediately recognizable as 'a Disney movie,' but neither does it establish its own narrative or visual signature, the way Tarantino did when remixing Asian influences for Kill Bill. This is pure pastiche, as Caro and her crew shamelessly pilfer from kung fu, Fifth Generation and Hong Kong action movies, incorporating anime and Bollywood touches as well.\"",
        "Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \"Mulan is a spirit lifter, and though it doesn't arrive as planned, it could not arrive at a better time\", saying, \"Throughout Mulan, there are shots of such visual splendor that viewers will catch their breath. In one, the morning mist clears and reveals an army in the distance, with its flags and colors, a frightening yet strangely beautiful sight.\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Mulan is a heroic muddle, one that elicits both a disappointed sigh and an appreciative nod. It lays down a marker of progress achieved and progress to come.\"",
        "Aja Romano of Vox wrote, \"The Mulan remake jettisons everything great about Disney's animated classic and delivers nothing new\" and \"Mulan's few bright spots can't save it from clunky writing\".",
        "Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central gave the film half a star out of four, writing, \"[E]verything about this Mulan is ironic accidentally. Whatever its intentions, its execution and the circumstances of its creation are in opposition to them. It's a feminist tract that enforces male notions of value; a call to arms that fights for the wrong side of our current history; and a proud statement of national identity that celebrates the Nation of Disney as opposed to China. It's majestically painful as a representation of how white people view Asians and, yes, it would be different had an Asian person been allowed to direct the film.\"",
        "Grace Wong of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \"The animated Mulan meant so much to me, and the character I grew up loving taught me that being loyal, brave and true means standing up for what you believe in, no matter the cost. Today, I believe Mulan would be on the side of the Hong Kong protesters, who also fight to have independence, their voices heard and their lives valued. I hoped to see these threads in the new iteration. Instead we got an almost unrecognizable, twisted reflection of the original.\"",
        "Hamilton College professor Zhuoyi Wang argues that the film \"is not, as many believe, just another Disney film suffering from simple artistic inability, cultural insensitivity, or political injustice, but a window into the tension-ridden intersectionality of the gender, sexual, racial, cultural, and political issues that shape the production and reception of today's cross-cultural films. [...] The film made significant compromises between its goals of cultural appropriateness, progressive feminism, and monetary success. Although it eventually failed to satisfactorily resolve these at times conflicting missions, it still achieved important progress in addressing some serious gender and cultural problems in Mulan's contemporary intertextual metamorphosis, especially those introduced by the Disney animation.\"",
        "Mulan was poorly received by Chinese critics and audiences. The film scored 4.7 out of 10 on the rating site Douban after its debut. Reviewers on Douban contended that the film had flat characters and a bland story with details that did not make sense. Many people also appeared unsatisfied with how the film handles certain Chinese cultural elements. One of the more common complaints about the film is its treatment of qi. Qi is a traditional idea in martial arts and Chinese medicine concerning a person's energy flow. But in Mulan, qi becomes a magical power that the eponymous heroine possesses. That power is limited by dishonesty, keeping Mulan from realizing her full potential until she strips away her disguise as a man. Other Chinese viewers complained about some of the characters' make-up, saying that it reflects Western stereotypes of China, rather than being a reflection of actual Chinese culture.",
        "Yanni Chow and Carol Mang of Reuters wrote that the film had \"a lacklustre reception in Hong Kong\" amidst calls from pro-democracy activists for a boycott."
