        "A reboot of the Spy Kids franchise was revealed to be in development in January 2021, with a film involving a plot that centers around a multicultural family. Series creator Robert Rodriguez returns as writer and director; the project is a joint-venture production between Skydance Media, Spyglass Media Group, and Double R Productions. Netflix acquired distribution rights the next year in March, making it the second Spy Kids project produced for the platform, while David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, Racer Max (Rodriguez's son), and Elizabeth Avell\u00e1n (Rodriguez's ex-wife) joined as producers.",
        "The title was revealed to be Spy Kids: Armageddon, which was the original name for the previous film installment, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World (2011). Along with the announcement of Max co-writing, and Rodriguez producing, the film's cast was revealed in the summer of 2022: Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Everly Carganilla, Connor Esterson, Billy Magnussen and D. J. Cotrona. Production wrapped in late August that same year."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 54% of 35 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Spy Kids: Armageddon offers solidly diverting action for younger viewers, even if it's starting to feel like this franchise has run out of reasons to continue.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Samantha Bergeson of IndieWire says it \"will certainly appeal to kids today, the kind that fall into the pre-tween age group who still dream about joining the CIA. As spy boss Devlin says at the end of the film, it\u2019s simply onto the next mission for the 'Spy Kids' family. Will that sequel rival 'Spy Kids 2'? Stay tuned.\" Maggie Lovitt of Collider says it \"may never be the generation-defining cult classic that its predecessors were, but it is still a long-overdue return to an unparalleled universe. In Rodriguez\u2019s world, hopepunk rules, and very few storytellers feel compelled to tell stories where there\u2019s unwavering optimism and hope for the future.\""
