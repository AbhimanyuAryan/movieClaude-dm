    "Plot": [
        "In the seaside town of Oceanside, 16-year-old Ruby Gillman lives with her family, trying to fit in with humans despite being krakens. Her mother Agatha forbids her from going to prom because of its location being on a ship in the ocean. At Oceanside High School, Ruby initially refuses, but her rebellious friends Margot, Trevin, and Bliss convince her to ask out her crush Connor. Before she can ask, she accidentally knocks Connor into the water. Ruby jumps in and saves him, but Connor believes he was saved by the new girl Chelsea Van Der Zee who tries to befriend Ruby. Ruby notices bioluminescent suction cups on her fingers and hides in the library. She attempts to call Agatha, but decides against it. To her confusion and horror, she transforms into a giant kraken and accidentally destroys the library after being startled by the librarian.",
        "Ruby panics after being spotted by Chelsea and runs to the lighthouse to hide. Agatha notices and chases her, reuniting with her brother Brill along the way, who had been sent to retrieve Ruby by her grandmother after she sensed the Pulse emitted by Ruby\u2019s transformation. Finally catching up with her, Agatha calms the distressed Ruby down and she shrinks down to her normal size. At the house, Arthur, Ruby's father, and Sam, Ruby's little brother, discover Ruby's transformation. Agatha explains how Ruby\u2019s earlier mishap triggered the transformation and that she also turns into a giant kraken.",
        "Angered that Agatha withheld the truth from her, Ruby sneaks out to meet her grandmother, the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas, with a reluctant Brill's help. Grandmamah reveals to Ruby that she is a princess and next in line to take the throne, to her shock. She also explains that outside the leviathans and the Umib\u014dzu, the mermaids are actually the most malevolent creatures in the seas and how Nerissa found a powerful trident called The Trident of Oceanus to rule the ocean. Agatha, the greatest Kraken warrior, trapped them for all eternity. Ruby declines the throne, but is thankful to have finally learned the truth. On her way home, she is attacked and almost killed by an elderly sailor and Oceanside tour guide, Gordon Lighthouse. Chelsea, who reveals she is a mermaid, saves and helps Ruby escape, much to Gordon's disappointment.",
        "Ruby tries to return to her normal life, but footage of her in her Kraken form becomes viral. She has a \"Super Sea Girl Ditch Day\" with Chelsea, who tells her that her mother, the mermaid Queen Nerissa, was supposedly killed trying to retrieve the Trident. She asks Ruby to get it to help unite the Krakens and Mermaids, so Ruby trains with Grandmamah to be powerful enough to get it.",
        "On prom night, Ruby tells her mother about Chelsea, but Agatha, disappointed and outraged that Ruby made friends with a mermaid, forbids her from seeing her grandmother, leading to a frustrated Ruby running back to the ocean to grab the Trident for Chelsea while Agatha confronts Grandmamah, with the latter stating Nerissa never had a daughter and the former realizing Chelsea is not who she says she is. Ruby succeeds in retrieving it but is betrayed by Chelsea, who reveals that she is Nerissa and uses Ruby to help her reclaim the trident to exact her revenge on the Krakens. Nerissa sheds her disguise and traps Ruby before going to destroy Oceanside. Agatha and Grandmamah try to fight her off while Brill finds a demoralized and wounded Ruby. After he encourages her, she goes to the surface to stop Nerissa. Nerissa overpowers Grandmamah and Agatha but is confronted by Ruby, who engages her in a duel over the trident, revealing her secret to her friends and Connor.",
        "Nerissa gains the upper hand, but Ruby disarms her, realizing that the Trident can be destroyed with enough power. Ruby attempts to reason with Nerissa to no avail, so she, Agatha and Grandmamah combine their laser eyes to destroy the trident, defeating Nerissa and shrinking her to her normal size, where Gordon cages her. Ruby reconciles with her mother, reunites with her friends, and asks Connor out to prom, which he accepts, while Agatha and Grandmamah also reconcile.",
        "Sometime later, everyone returns to their normal lives. The Gillmans become more popular and successful than before. Ruby and Connor become a couple and she becomes the protector of Oceanside. Ruby then enters the sea upon being informed by Brill that a Devil Whale is heading towards the Kraken Kingdom."

    "Production": [
        "In 2016, screenwriters Brian C Brown & Elliott DiGuiseppi pitched the story of a family of sea monsters living on land in plain sight to many major studios and producers, including Brad Grey at Paramount Pictures, Nancy Utley at Fox Searchlight Pictures, Kim Zubick of Zubick Films, Ivan Reitman of The Montecito Picture Company, Wyck Godfrey of Temple Hill Entertainment, Julie Yorn, and Todd Garner of Broken Road, but was rejected by all of them. Eventually, they pitched it to Chris Kuser, a development executive at Dreamworks Animation. Titled Meet the Gillmans, the script drew from their shared memories of growing up in Oviedo, Florida as well as Brown\u2019s personal experiences as a first generation Cuban American, The Gillman family are loosely based on Brown\u2019s real life family.",

        "With original director Paul Tibbitt at the helm, and the addition of another writer, Neighbors from Hell creator Pam Brady, the film slowly started moving forward.

        "Cooney Cilella wanted to bring the film in a whole new direction, so after Tibbit step down from his role as director, Cooney Cilella contacted Academy Award nominee Kirk DeMicco, who had recently made Vivo to be director with Pearl being promoted as co-director.",

        "Additional characters were designed by Craig Kellman, Annie Award winning character designer of The Bad Guys Taylor Krahenbahl, Julien Le Rolland and many others.",
        "One challenge was the design of the hair for the film's villain Nerissa. The VFX department headed by Lawrence Lee created a Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) simulation which was used to simulate the character's interaction with the surrounding ocean. With an additional level set fillet generation technique was used to blend the ocean mesh with the water hair geometry.",

    "Reception": [
        "Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken grossed $15.7\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $30.4\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $46.1\u00a0million. The film is the second-lowest-grossing film from DreamWorks Animation, and was considered a box-office failure.",
        "In the United States and Canada, Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken was released alongside Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The film made $2.3 million on its first day, including $725,000 from Thursday night previews. The film debuted with $5.5 million, becoming DreamWorks Animation's lowest-grossing opening weekend of any of their feature films to date. The film's sixth-place finish also made it the studio's lowest-ranking three-day opening weekend, tying Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas from 2003. Several publications attributed the reasons for its low opening to the film's limited three-month marketing, unclear target age group, an original film not based on an existing IP, its title, the trailers, and competition from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Elemental.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 65% of 98 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken is littered with too much flotsam and jetsam from better animated features to stand as a true original, but its inherent sweetness and lively style make for likable enough family entertainment.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 50 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 68% of filmgoers gave it a positive score.",
        "Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing, \"South Park veteran Pam Brady, who shares screenwriting credit with Brian C. Brown and Elliott DiGuiseppi, brings all kinds of funny ideas to the film, which DeMicco does an admirable job of executing. But there's a simpler, more sincere movie underneath it all that seems to be taunting audiences, like a glowing shape from deep below.\" Tara McNamara of Common Sense Media gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing: \"A parenting gold mine, this literal fish out of water story is completely entertaining and enjoyable for all ages, with plenty of positive messages. The message to kids can be applied in a variety of ways: \"shine your light\".\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a C+, and wrote in her review, \"Kids are always in need of gracious tales about the power of being yourself in a world not necessarily built to embrace differences and stories like \"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken\" can do that, with fun to spare. But why not get more splashy?\"",
        "Other critics felt that the storyline was underdeveloped and that the film failed to live up to its potential. Rachel LeBonte of Screen Rant rates it 2.5 out of 5 stars, calling the film \"endearing\" and praising the voice cast, but saying that it may have trouble making an impression with so many other options. She wrote, \"That is Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken's biggest flaw: It doesn't go beyond surface-level. As Ruby gets more involved with the ocean and her burgeoning friendship with fellow sea creature Chelsea, her ties to the human world fall away, lessening the overall impact of her arc.\" Leigh Paatsch of Herald Sun awarded the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Visually, the movie becomes more of an eyesore as it slithers along, while the story mashes up some confusing marine mythology with contemporary plotting points seen to better effect in Pixar's recent release Turning Red.\" James Berardinelli, film critic for ReelViews, awarded the film 2 out of 4, stars writing, \"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken is one of the most inconsequential big-screen cartoons to reach theaters this year.\"",
        "Alonso Duralde of The Film Verdict gave the film a negative review, writing, \"Plays like the result of feeding the screenplays of recent Pixar titles Luca and Turning Red into ChatGPT and then animating the results. Unfortunately, this new coming-of-age tale doesn't come anywhere near the depth or delight of its predecessors.\" Greg Nussen of Slant Magazine awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing, \"Sweet but narratively thin and didactic, the latest from DreamWorks Animation always seems as if it's trying to find its footing.\" Robert Kojder of Flickering Myth gave the film a negative review, writing \"Even though the voiceover performances and some character relationship dynamics are serviceable, Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken drowns itself in flat animation, questionable plot choices, and too many ideas.\""
