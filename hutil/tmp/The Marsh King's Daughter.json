    "Release": [
        "Initially meant to be released by STXfilms, the film's distribution was shopped to different distributors following the dissolution of STXfilms' domestic distribution company: eventually, STXfilms formed a domestic distribution partnership with Lionsgate, Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions scheduling the film for release on October 6, 2023. It was later delayed to November 3, 2023, to avoid competition with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. Amazon Studios will distribute the film in European markets as part of ErosSTX's multi-year output deal with the company via Prime Video.",
