The film stars Karen Gillan as a young hitwoman who must team up with her estranged mother (Lena Headey) and her former colleagues (Carla Gugino, Michelle Yeoh, and Angela Bassett) in order to save a young girl (Chloe Coleman) from rival assassins sent by the grieving father of a man she killed on orders from the head of the HR department of The Firm, Nathan (Paul Giamatti).\nThe film's production was announced at the American Film Market in 2018. Casting announcements were made throughout 2019, starting with Gillan in January, and principal photography took place from June to August 2019 in Berlin. It is a co-production between The Picture Company, Babelsberg Studio and StudioCanal's German branch with the participation of French television channels Canal+ and Cin\u00e9+.\nGunpowder Milkshake was released in the United States on July 14, 2021, by Netflix with a simultaneous limited theatrical release. It was released theatrically by StudioCanal in France on July 21, and in Germany on December 2, 2021. The film received mixed reviews from critics. A sequel is in development.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn a flashback at a diner, twelve-year-old Sam learns that her assassin mother, Scarlet, is skipping town after a job gone wrong. Armed men arrive to kill Scarlet, but she kills them and escapes, leaving an upset Sam behind to be cared for by Nathan.\nFifteen years later, the now 27-year-old Sam works as an assassin for Nathan, the human resources head for the same firm Scarlet worked for. Nathan gives Sam a new job, killing a man who stole money from The Firm and returning the money. Sam goes to a weapons armory disguised as a library to exchange her weapons for new ones. There, she meets Anna May, Madeleine, and Florence - three former accomplices of Scarlet. They consider killing her for showing up unannounced, but change their minds when they learn her identity. They provide her with clean weapons for the job.\nSam infiltrates a hotel room to retrieve the stolen money and shoots the man responsible in the abdomen when he lunges for his ringing phone. Listening in on the call, she learns that he stole the money to save his kidnapped young daughter and must bring it to a nearby bowling alley to exchange for her. Sam takes him to a firm-affiliated private doctor for treatment and agrees to handle the exchange herself.\nNathan learns of her plan and sends three henchmen to stop her and retrieve the money; Sam incapacitates them before continuing with her plan. Masked men give her the girl, Emily, before retreating with the money; Sam pursues them, but the men turn on one another, resulting in their deaths and the destruction of the stolen money.\nMeanwhile, Nathan learns that one of the henchmen Sam killed in an earlier job was the son of Jim McAlister, the head of a powerful criminal empire. To avoid conflict, Nathan gives up Sam's information and location to be killed. Sam returns to the doctor to reunite Emily with her father, but they learn that he did not survive. Nathan's three henchmen are also at the doctor seeking treatment for their prior fight and they receive orders to kill her. The doctor injects Sam with a serum that renders her arms useless. Sam asks Emily to tape a knife and a gun to her hands and she uses them to fight and kill the three henchmen. More henchmen arrive, but Sam and Emily escape in Sam's car, with Emily steering and Sam working the pedals.\nSam receives a text from Nathan, giving her the address to a safe house where she can find supplies to help her escape. She and Emily travel there and run into Scarlet, who reveals she has been watching Sam from afar for 15 years. When henchmen arrive to kill Sam, Scarlet guides them through a hidden escape route.\nThey manage to escape and return to the library, where the librarians angrily demand why Scarlet never tried to contact them when she disappeared. They are interrupted by arriving gunmen. Sam attempts to hold them off, but, after she is overpowered, Scarlet intervenes to save her. The librarians consider fleeing with Emily, but they decide to join the fight.\nAll the gunmen are killed except for Virgil, Jim McAlister's nephew, who kills Madeleine and kidnaps Emily. Virgil calls Sam, who offers to turn herself in at the diner in exchange for Emily's freedom. Sam arrives to meet Jim McAlister who explains that his late son had four older sisters that Jim could not relate to as he does not understand women. Jim intends to torture Sam and make Emily watch, but Scarlet, Anna May, and Florence arrive with guns to free them. Sam takes Emily and leaves the diner before the three women kill Jim and all his henchmen.\nSometime later, Sam apologizes to Emily for killing her father and Emily forgives her. Emily goes to Nathan's home disguised as a Girl Scout. Sam threatens his life unless he returns to The Firm and calls off the hit on her. Sam, Emily, Scarlet, Anna May, and Florence then drive down the coast together.\n\nCast[edit]\nKaren Gillan as Sam, a master assassin working for The Firm, and Scarlet's daughter\nFreya Allan as young Sam\nLena Headey as Scarlet, Sam's estranged mother and former leader of the sisterhood of assassins\nCarla Gugino as Madeleine, a member of the sisterhood of assassins\nChloe Coleman as Emily, a young girl Sam protects after killing her father\nRalph Ineson as Jim McAlester, the leader of a powerful crime organization\nAdam Nagaitis as Virgil, McAlester's nephew and a master assassin\nMichael Smiley as Dr. Ricky, the chief of a secret clinic for assassins\nMichelle Yeoh as Florence, a member of the sisterhood of assassins\nAngela Bassett as Anna May, a member of the sisterhood of assassins\nPaul Giamatti as Nathan, head of the HR department for The Firm, and Sam's adoptive father\nAdditionally, Samuel Anderson appears as David, Emily's father, Ivan Kaye plays Yankee, the leader of the assassins sent by The Firm after Sam.

As compensation for the busy visuals, the storyline will be a comfortable one, especially to fans of La Femme Nikita, L\u00e9on: The Professional, Gloria and any number of large-caliber ancestors.\"[39] Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club gave the film a B and stated, \"The novelty of watching the film's impressive female ensemble bounce off one another never wears off, even if Gunpowder Milkshake feels like it only ever scratches the surface of what each of its leads can do.\"[40]\n\nSequel[edit]\nOn April 30, 2021, Deadline Hollywood announced that The Picture Company and StudioCanal were working on a sequel.[41] On July 6, 2021, StudioCanal confirmed during a special presentation for its 30th anniversary in Cannes that a sequel is officially in development.[42]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Netflix and STX Films released the film in the United States, Canada and the Nordics.\n\n^ StudioCanal released the film in France, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n^ Released in France as Bloody Milkshake[4]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Christopher Marc (February 11, 2019). \"EXCLUSIVE: Oscar-Nominee Viggo Mortensen Offered Role In 'Gunpowder Milkshake' \u2013 Plus Character Breakdowns/Plot Details\".
