In October 2013, Spike Lee was in talks to direct the film. In January 2014, the film was delayed due to the Envision Entertainment scandal.",
        "In June 2019, Deadline reported that Timothy Bogart would direct the film, with Jeremy Jordan now cast as Bogart, and Samuel L. Jackson, Kenan Thompson, Jason Isaacs and Jason Derulo amongst the extensive cast. Richard Dreyfuss and Sebastian Maniscalco were added to the cast in August. In June 2021, new cast members were announced, including Wiz Khalifa replacing Jackson and newcomer Casey Likes playing Gene Simmons.",
        "Filming began on July 16, 2019, in Montreal, with plans to wrap on September 20. On August 23, Canadian actors' union ACTRA issued a \"Do Not Work\" order forbidding its members from working on the film, alleging the producers were \"unfair engagers for failure to meet payroll obligations.\" As of June 17, 2021, filming had begun in New Jersey."
