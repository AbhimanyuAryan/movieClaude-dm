    "Plot": [
        "Big Dave, editor of the Daily Print tabloid, is snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson at a party and hires private detective Fletcher to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield. Pressfield, a duke, has a heroin-addicted daughter named Laura. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled Bush) to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320 million.",
        "Born into poverty in the U.S., Pearson won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, where he began selling marijuana before dropping out and building his criminal empire. He now plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for \u00a3400m and retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the guards, steal marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' horrified trainer, \"Coach\", orders them to delete the video.",
        "Following the raid, Pearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates as a precaution. At the request of Pressfield, he also agrees to bring Laura home. Raymond retrieves her from a council estate where she lives with other addicts. In a brawl with her flatmates, one of Raymond's men accidentally kills Aslan, a young Russian. Laura is returned to her parents and then dies of an overdose.",
        "Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed The Toddlers about the lab location. While attempting to escape, Phuc gets fatally run over by a train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George is then executed by one of his own men.",
        "Dry Eye is actually in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills his men before running out of bullets. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.",
        "Fletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders The Toddlers to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him having sex with a pig, threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation and publishes nothing. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to \u00a3130 million, on account of the recent disruptions, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers \u00a3270 million compensation for the blood he now has on his hands and the cost of restoring order. Pearson admits he is not \"emotional about the money\" but because Rosalind was assaulted, he demands \"a pound of flesh\" from Berger's own body, anywhere Berger chooses, as compensation for this indiscretion.",
        "Fletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals he was tailing Fletcher all along. The Toddlers have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a Russian oligarch and former KGB agent. The assassin whom Raymond killed earlier was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are ambushed by The Toddlers who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They riddle the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to Miramax. After his meeting, he gets into a cab only to realize that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate together."

        "It was announced in May 2018 that Guy Ritchie would write and direct The Gentlemen, a film that would be in the same spirit as his earlier Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch.

In October, Matthew McConaughey, Kate Beckinsale, Henry Golding and Hugh Grant were cast, with Jeremy Strong, Jason Wong and Colin Farrell joining in November. Later, Michelle Dockery signed on, replacing Beckinsale in her role. In December 2018, Lyne Ren\u00e9e was added as well.",
        "Principal photography began in November 2018. Filming locations included West London Film Studios, Longcross Studios, The Princess Victoria pub in Shepherd's Bush and Brompton Cemetery."

    "Reception": [
        "The Gentlemen grossed $15.9 million in the United Kingdom, $36.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $62.8 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $115.2 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Turning, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,100 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.1 million on its first day, including $725,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $10.6 million, finishing fourth at the box office. It then made $6 million in its second weekend, finishing fifth. In its third and fourth weekends the film made a respective $4.2 million and $2.7 million.",
        "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 274 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"It may not win writer-director Guy Ritchie many new converts, but for those already attuned to the filmmaker's brash wavelength, The Gentlemen stands tall.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported an average 3.5 out of 5 stars, with 48% of people saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt rated the film a \"B\u2212\" and found it to come up short when compared to Ritchie's previous crime films, stating, \"The Gentlemen is nothing if not a callback to the Locks of yesteryear, star-stacked and defibrillated with enough juice to jolt a gorilla out of cardiac arrest.\"",
        "The movie was also criticized for racism. Writing for The Guardian, Simran Hans writes \"By Ritchie\u2019s logic, white weed kingpins are entrepreneurs with the moral high ground; Asian heroin-pushers are 'the killers of worlds.\"' Gary M. Kramer, writing for Salon, said \"Ritchie thinks casual racism is funny, and the film's Asian characters are all called the derogatory c-word: 'Chinamen.' Most everyone else on screen is called the other, equally taboo c-word, which is meant to be cheeky, but it is not. It is offensive; cringe-inducing rather than amusing, and one wonders when the juvenile Ritchie is going to grow the f**k up and quit being so conceited about his smartassery.\"",
        "Three years after the film's release, Ritchie was sued by the actor Mickey De Hara (who had played Turbo in Richie's prior film RocknRolla) for copying the \"cast of characters, their characterization and 'unique aspects of the plot'\" from a screenplay De Hara had offered Ritchie as a sequel to RocknRolla. De Hara claimed that when he had tried to address the issue out of court, Ritchie responded, \"Mickey, I and my people have tried to contact you for some years now. There was no response. I am happy for us to sit down and have a chat.\" De Hara claimed that the most blatant instance of copying was a scene involving the character Coach and \"The Toddlers\" gang he leads, which was an almost exact match to a scene from De Hara's screenplay with a character Coach leading a group of thugs nicknamed \"The Baby Squad.\" Ritchie filed his defense to the London High Court denying the allegations in August 2023.  Ritchie confirmed that discussions took place regarding a potential RocknRolla sequel or trilogy and that he used some aspects of the screenplay for The Gentlemen; however, he claimed the contributions of De Hara were well below both the Writers Guild of America and Writers Guild of Great Britain thresholds to receive credit."
