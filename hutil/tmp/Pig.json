        "Robin \"Rob\" Feld is a reclusive truffle-forager who was once a renowned Portland chef. Living in a cabin deep in the Oregon forests, he hunts for truffles with the help of his prized foraging pig, which he sells exclusively to Amir, a young and inexperienced supplier of luxury ingredients to high-end restaurants.",
        "One night, Rob is attacked by unidentified assailants as they steal his pig. He contacts Amir, who helps him locate a pair of bedraggled drug-addicts suspected by another local truffle-hunter. They claim the pig was taken to Portland.",
        "After his old friend Edgar refuses to help, Rob leads Amir to an underground fighting ring for restaurant people below the defunct Portland Hotel, saying certain names carry cachet. Rob identifies himself to the crowd, then allows himself to be beaten to a pulp by a waiter in exchange for Edgar's information.",
        "Shocked to learn his identity, the following morning Amir reveals that his parents had such a miserable marriage the only happy time he remembers is a night when they had dinner at Rob's restaurant, before his mother died by suicide. Rob in turn asks Amir to secure reservations at Eurydice, a trendy haute cuisine restaurant which is owned by Amir's father. In the meantime, Rob visits the house where he used to live with his wife Lori, whose death compelled Rob to withdraw to the woods.",
        "At Eurydice, Rob asks to meet with its head chef, Derek, a former prep cook at Rob's restaurant. Rob pointedly yet empathetically criticizes Derek for opening a contemporary restaurant rather than the pub he always wanted to run. Overwhelmed by the memory of his dream and the reality of his current circumstances, Derek confesses that Amir's wealthy father, Darius, was behind the theft of his pig, having learned of its existence from Amir. Rob angrily ends his partnership with Amir before going to confront Darius at his home. Darius promises him $25,000 in exchange for the pig and threatens to kill it should Rob continue his pursuit.",
        "Rob leaves, finding Amir waiting outside, having just left his comatose mother in a care facility, revealing she is still alive. Rob admits that he does not need his pig to hunt truffles since the trees tell him where they are; he loves her. He gives Amir a list of items and tells him to use Rob's name to obtain them.",
        "Rob visits his former baker for a salted baguette and a few pastries he shares with Amir before they go back to Darius' house. Rob guides Amir as they prepare the same meal for Darius which Rob served to him and his wife, including a rare wine from Rob's personal collection, which Amir obtained from the woman caring for the mausoleum containing Lori's ashes.",
        "All three men sit down to eat together, despite Darius' resistance. An emotional Darius leaves the table after just a few tastes. When Rob  follows and confronts him, Darius asks why he is doing this, and Rob says he remembers every meal he ever cooked and every person he ever served. Darius tearfully confesses that the junkies he hired for the theft had mishandled the pig, resulting in her death. Rob collapses in tears, and a remorseful Amir drives him back to a diner near home. Despite Amir's foolishness, Rob says he will see him next Thursday.",
        "Returning to his forest, Rob washes his bloody face in the lake before returning to his cabin to play a tape that Lori recorded of herself singing Bruce Springsteen's \"I'm on Fire\" to him for his birthday."

Club gave the film a grade of \"A\", writing that \"There are no plot twists, in the traditional sense, but each successive encounter reveals a new facet that enriches the tale.\" Carlos Aguilar of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Not all the ingredients make sense together, but the product of their intermingling inside the filmmaker's narrative pot render a special concoction.\" Noel Murray, in his review of the film for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that, \"Though its plot follows the same rough outline of a John Wick-style shoot-em-up, Pig is actually a quiet and often melancholy meditation on loss, anchored by a character who wishes he could shake free of the person he used to be.\"",
        "Kristy Puchko, in her review of the film for Pajiba, wrote: \"Pig is not only a mesmerizing while meditative drama about love and loss. It is also a powerful reminder that Cage is one of the most talented, most captivating movie stars of our time.\" Cody Corrall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review and stated, \"Even through its various webs of tragedy, relentless ambition, and destruction for capital gain\u2014Pig remarkably and overwhelmingly champions care and kindness.\" Randy Myers of The Mercury News gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and stated, \"It is Cage who carries Pig with a measured performance in which his trademark outbursts pierce the soul. He's magnificent.\"",
        "Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, writing that, \"While Pig can at times feel engulfed by its own sullenness, there's a rigor to the filmmaking and a surreal beauty to Pat Scola's images that seal our investment in Robin's fate.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film four out of four stars, and wrote: \"What a beguiling, confounding film Pig is. From start to finish, it never moves as you might expect it to.\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post also gave the film four out of four stars, writing that \"Pig's stock in trade is a kind of visual and narrative poetry, and Sarnoski and Block ply it with the skill and light touch of master chefs.\" The Guardian's Benjamin Lee gave the film three out of five stars and stated, \"It... hints at exciting things to come from Sarnoski, a gifted visual filmmaker, who has assembled a promising, if imperfect, debut.\"",

        "In July 2023, Comic Book Resources ranked it number 7 on its list of the \"Best Indie Movies of the 2020s (So Far),\" saying that \"There's something simple and beautiful about slice-of-life stories, but Pig takes it to a new level, showcasing a way of life and field of work rarely seen. In August 2023, Collider ranked the film at number 12 on its list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing that the film \"showed the world why Cage had become such an icon in the first place; he narrowed his focus and gave one of the most moving performances of his career as the former chef Rob.\""
