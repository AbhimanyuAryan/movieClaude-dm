        "Cousins Teresa and Jessica, and Jessica's boyfriend Caleb, are vacationing at a lakeside cabin when a seemingly ill Jessica scalps Teresa and decapitates Caleb before levitating above the lake.",
        "One day earlier, upset at learning she is pregnant, guitar technician Beth visits her sister Ellie, a tattoo artist and single mother to teenagers Danny and Bridget, and child Kassie, in their home at Monde Apartments, a condemned Los Angeles apartment complex. The building is shaken by an earthquake while the children are in its basement parking lot, uncovering a concealed chamber. Danny investigates it, discovering religious artifacts, three phonograph records from 1923, and a strange book that he takes up to his room, believing he could possibly sell it and use the money to help Ellie. The initial record details rejected efforts by a priest to research the book, revealed to be one of three volumes of the Naturom Demonto. The subsequent record reveals the priest continued his research in secret and recites an incantation that summons demonic entities known as Deadites.",
        "The building's power fails and Ellie is possessed by an unseen force. She returns to the apartment in a trance, menacingly threatens her family, and dies after pleading with Beth to protect her children. Beth and Ellie's neighbors help lay her to rest in her bedroom and search for a way out. They find that the staircase has collapsed, the elevator is damaged, and they are unable to access the fire escape before Ellie revives and attacks the family, wounding Beth and Bridget. Beth and the children lock Ellie outside the apartment after she pursues and massacres the neighbors.",
        "Danny confesses to Beth about recovering the Naturom Demonto, and Ellie tricks Kassie into unlocking the door before attacking her. While Danny and Beth are distracted rescuing Kassie and locking Ellie out, Bridget becomes possessed via her wound. Bridget attacks Beth before turning on Danny and Kassie, who inadvertently impales her through the head with a broken broom handle.",
        "Beth listens to the third record to understand how to exorcise the Deadites, but learns the priest failed and his allies were all possessed, with only complete destruction of the host stopping the Deadites. Bridget revives and fatally stabs Danny, who sets Bridget on fire before dying as Ellie infiltrates the apartment using the vents. Realizing Beth is pregnant, Ellie attempts to rip the fetus out of her, but Beth and Kassie are able to incapacitate her with scissors. Ellie fails to emotionally manipulate Kassie, who accepts that her mother is already gone.",
        "Danny and the bodies of the neighbors are possessed, leading Beth and Kassie to take shelter in the damaged elevator. Ellie, Bridget, and Danny merge into a multi-limbed creature known as the Marauder and climb atop the elevator to attack the pair as the elevator fills with blood. The combined weight causes the elevator to plummet to the ground floor, allowing Beth and Kassie to flee into the parking lot. The Marauder captures Kassie and attempts to behead her with a chainsaw, but Beth returns and distracts it, and she and Kassie destroy the Marauder's body by forcing it into a wood chipper. Ellie's severed head taunts Beth, saying she will be a failure as a mother, prompting her to kick Ellie's head into the chipper. Beth and Kassie escape the building together.",
        "The next morning, Jessica goes to the parking lot to leave for her vacation, where she is attacked by an unseen force."

        "Bruce Campbell is featured in an uncredited voice-only cameo role heard in a recording on one of the phonograph records from 1923; Campbell voices an unnamed character who forewarns the priests to the dangers of the demon resurrection ritual, and demands they destroy the book. Writer-director Cronin stated that he had Campbell voice this role intentionally, stating that he considers it to be a time-displaced Ash Williams."

        "At the film's South by Southwest (SXSW) premiere, Fede \u00c1lvarez announced that his film Evil Dead (2013), a remake of The Evil Dead (1981), would be getting a sequel. In addition, Sam Raimi confirmed plans to write Evil Dead 4 with his brother Ivan Raimi; it was later specified that the film would be a sequel to Army of Darkness (1992). At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Bruce Campbell and \u00c1lvarez stated that their ultimate plan was for \u00c1lvarez's Evil Dead 2 and Raimi's Army of Darkness 2 to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash Williams and Mia Allen. Campbell confirmed that he would reprise his role as Ash in Army of Darkness 2. \u00c1lvarez later that month tweeted to his followers that Raimi would serve as director on Army of Darkness 2. By November, Campbell expressed doubts in a fourth Evil Dead film, with Raimi's Army of Darkness 2 ultimately being redeveloped as a sequel television series, Ash vs Evil Dead, starring Campbell and airing on Starz from October 31, 2015, to April 29, 2018.",
        "Following the cancellation of a fourth season of Ash vs Evil Dead in April 2019, that November, speaking on the future of the Evil Dead franchise, \u00c1lvarez announced that \"They're just ideas right now. Nothing to announce officially. We do have a script for Don't Breathe 2. That's the only difference. We don't have a script for Evil Dead 2. But we do have a script for Don't Breathe 2 that we wrote.\" He also said that \"When I tweeted that I was interested in seeing what people prefer. We were having some internal debates about what people would be interested in most. Unfortunately, Evil Dead 2 won. Which, I guess I would have preferred Don't Breathe 2 to win because it's one of my own creations. Obviously Evil Dead has the bigger following.\" In July 2019, Raimi discussed the future of the Evil Dead franchise, saying that \"We'd like to make another Evil Dead feature [film] and in fact we're working on some ideas right now.\" Raimi said that he would be interested in making another film with Campbell, however, Campbell earlier claimed that he had retired from the role of Ash. He said another option would be a sequel to the 2013 reboot, however, he is unsure if \u00c1lvarez would want to make a sequel at this point because the director is a successful \"artist in demand\" now. Despite this, Campbell would appear in the film in a \"teeny, tiny, little cameo\" as a character identified by the film's writer-director Lee Cronin as a time-displaced Ash Williams.",
        "In October 2019, Raimi announced at New York Comic Con that a new Evil Dead film was in development. Robert G. Tapert was set to produce, while Raimi and Campbell served as executive producers only, all under their Ghost House Pictures banner. In June 2020, Campbell revealed that Lee Cronin was handpicked by Raimi to write and direct the film, then titled Evil Dead Now, after Cronin previously collaborated with Raimi on the horror streaming series 50 States of Fright. In May 2021, New Line Cinema (who distributed the first film) had picked up the film, with it scheduled to be released on HBO Max and retitled Evil Dead Rise.",
        "In May 2021, it was reported that Australian actresses Alyssa Sutherland and Lily Sullivan had been cast in the lead roles. In June 2021, Gabrielle Echols, Morgan Davies, and Nell Fisher were added to the cast. In July 2021, Mia Challis was reported to have joined the cast.",
        "Principal photography began in New Zealand on June 6, 2021, with Dave Garbett serving as cinematographer. Garbett previously served as a cinematographer on several episodes of Ash vs Evil Dead, as well as production designer Nick Bassett. Interior settings, including the inside of the apartment building, the parking garage, and the underground bank vault, were constructed sets in a rented warehouse space in Mount Wellington. The opening sequence at the cabin and lake was shot on private property outside of Auckland; the exterior of the cabin, which was only a fa\u00e7ade, was built on location, while the cabin's interior was built in the warehouse in Mount Wellington. On July 14, 2021, Cronin revealed that filming was officially half way done. Filming officially wrapped on October 27, 2021.",
        "Cronin stated the film used over 6,500 liters (1,717 U.S. gallons) of fake blood. The fake blood is a mixture of food-based dyes, high fructose corn syrup, and water, a recipe used by special effects supervisor Brendon Durey. Due to the amount of fake blood needed, a commercial food manufacturer was hired to produce the substance, and large bulk shipping containers were used to transport and store it. As with past installments in the series, the film relied more heavily on practical effects than computer-generated imagery. The bathroom in Beth's apartment was built on hydraulics to allow the set to shake. The apartment elevator was built in a steel frame that allowed it to be lifted or dropped; it was outfitted with removable wooden paneling that was treated to avoid being stained by fake blood.",
        "The scene in which the elevator fills with blood was accomplished by lowering the constructed elevator into a 6,000\u00a0L (1,585\u00a0U.S.\u00a0gal) tank of fake blood using a forklift. The following shot, an homage to the 1980 film The Shining in which blood pours out from the elevator into the building's lobby, took place on a full-size set made partly from plywood. Two large \"dump tanks\" attached to a ramp allowed the amount of liquid to pour out from the elevator doors at the desired speed. The special effects team ran rehearsals of the sequence using stunt performers and water. The scene was shot in two takes\u2014once for the wide shots and once for close-ups of the actors\u2014using a multicamera setup. Cronin stated, \"The cleanup would take about eight hours, and so if we didn't get it the first time, we would clean up and then shoot it again at the end of the day. But we got it in the first pass.\"",
        "The editing of the film's visual components took over six months to complete, in an editing suite in Cronin's hometown of Dublin. In March 2022, Cronin tweeted that the picture editing process had been completed, writing: \"Onto music composition and sound design we go.\" Myk Farmer serves as the film's sound mixer. The negative pickup cost was $19 million.",
        "Along with his voice cameo on the phonograph record, Bruce Campbell also contributed foley to the film, with Cronin stating, \"There's a scene around an eye where there's some munching, and Bruce created that sound by eating an apple furiously for me\".",
        "In April 2022, Stephen McKeon was announced to be composing the score, after collaborating with Cronin on The Hole in the Ground (2019).",
