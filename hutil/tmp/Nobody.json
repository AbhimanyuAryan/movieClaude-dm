    "Plot": [
        "Hutch Mansell sits inside of an interrogation room, heavily bruised and injured. Two FBI agents interrogate him about his identity, before Hutch responds that he's simply \"nobody\".",
        "In a flashback, Hutch leads an ordinary, mundane life as an office worker with his emotionally estranged wife Becca, teenage son Blake and young daughter, Abby. One night, two thieves break into their house with a gun. Blake jumps one of them and Hutch picks up a golf club but does not swing. The thieves leave.",
        "Everyone thinks Hutch a failure for not fighting, but he reveals to his brother Harry that he held back because he knew the burglar's gun was unloaded. His brother-in-law Charlie offers Hutch a gun for protection, which he refuses. Hutch offers to buy out his father-in-law Eddie's business, but Eddie considers it a bad offer.",
        "The following evening, Abby realizes her bracelet is missing, so Hutch sets out to find it. Suspecting one of the thieves took it, he recalls seeing a tattoo on one of them and traces it back to a tattoo parlor. Hutch locates the thieves and demands they return the bracelet, but leaves in frustration after realizing they do not have it.",
        "While on a bus heading home, a group of intoxicated thugs board the bus and begin harassing a young woman; Hutch brutally fights them off. Unbeknownst to him, the group's leader, Teddy, is the brother of Yulian Kuznetsov, a Russian crime lord safeguarding the mob's Obshchak money (a common treasury used to settle disputes in the Russian mafia). Hutch breaks Teddy's windpipe before performing a crude tracheotomy with a straw to allow him to breathe, although he falls into a coma.",
        "Hutch returns home and is bandaged by Becca, who knows of his past. He vents his frustrations about living a mundane life to her, before they reaffirm their love for one another. Meanwhile, Yulian manages to identify and locate Hutch using his dropped metro card, so sends a team to his home to capture him while blackmailing a United States Department of Defense official to uncover Hutch's past.",
        "Harry calls Hutch ahead and warns him of Teddy's connection to Yulian. He suggests he check with The Barber, Hutch's former government handler. When the capture team arrives, Hutch hides his family and kills most of the attackers. He is immobilized by an electric taser, and taken by the Russian team.",
        "While being transported in the trunk of a car, Hutch finds and empties a canister of fire suppressant into the car. The driver crashes, killing most of the occupants, and freeing Hutch.",
        "Hutch returns home and reveals that he is a former \"auditor\", an assassin employed by the United States Intelligence Community. While working as such, Hutch spared a target who later reformed and lived happily with a new family. Wanting a similar life, Hutch retired and settled down.",
        "Hutch sends his family to safety and retrieves his hidden gold and cash; he also finds Abby's bracelet under the couch. He burns their house down to dispose of the dead attackers in the basement and steals his neighbor's Dodge Challenger.",
        "Two assassins attempt to kill Hutch's father David at his retirement home but he is a retired agent himself and cleverly manages to kill them. Hutch uses his gold to buy his father-in-law's metal fabrication factory and booby-traps the entire place. He then goes to burn Yulian's Obshchak money.",
        "Hutch visits Yulian and offers to end the fighting. Yulian also wants out as he cannot re-finance the entire Obshchak. Knowing of Yulian's plans to retire, Hutch suggests a retirement in one of the lesser-known Caribbean islands away from the Russian mafia, while Hutch gets his life back.",
        "However, Yulian and his men pursue Hutch to the factory and surround him nonetheless. Suddenly, Harry and David arrive to assist him, and the trio kill Yulian and the Russian mobsters. The police arrive and the opening scene is revisited, but he is suddenly released without charges following a mysterious phone call.",
        "Three months later, Hutch and his family have returned to normal life and are buying a new house, when Hutch receives a call hinting that more trouble may be on the way."

        "A week prior to its United States release, Variety estimated the film would gross around $5 million in its opening weekend, compared to its expectation that it would open to around $15 million in a pre-COVID marketplace.

The website's critics consensus reads, \"Nobody doesn't break any new ground for the genre, but this viscerally violent thriller smashes, shatters, and destroys plenty of other things \u2013 all while proving Bob Odenkirk has what it takes to be an action star.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 83% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore praised the film's \"enjoyably absurd violence\", and wrote, \"Taking itself much less seriously than the Taken series and its predecessors, it's a wish-fulfillment romp just as ludicrous as any of them but more fun than most.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing, \"Most impressive of all is Odenkirk, who looks and sounds nothing like an action star until it's time for Hutch to become an action star, and we totally believe this physically unimpressive, normally mild-mannered guy as a simmering cauldron of rage who could take that teapot over there and kill ya with it.\""
