        "The film had its world premiere on September 9, 2020 at the Deauville American Film Festival, where a jury presided over by Vanessa Paradis awarded it the Jury Prize. It was previously set to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020, but this was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film subsequently got invited back to the 2021 Tribeca Film Festival, screening outdoors in Manhattan as part of the 20th anniversary edition of the festival. During its festival run, Lorelei also picked up Audience and Jury Awards at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg and the Jordan Ressler First Feature Award at the Miami International Film Festival. In March 2021, Vertical Entertainment acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It was released on July 30, 2021."
