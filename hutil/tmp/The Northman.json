Based on the legend of Amleth, the film stars Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd (who also produced), Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Gustav Lindh, with Ethan Hawke, Bj\u00f6rk, and Willem Dafoe. It focuses on Amleth, a Viking prince who sets out on a quest to avenge the murder of his father. The film is heavily influenced by Norse mythology.[6]\nSkarsg\u00e5rd had wanted to make a Viking film for several years, and Eggers decided to make the film his third project after the pair met to discuss possible collaborations. Much of the cast joined in October 2019, and filming took place in locations throughout Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Iceland from August to December 2020.\nThe Northman premiered in Stockholm at Rigoletto Cinema on March 28, 2022. It began theatrical release in some countries on April 13, 2022, and was released theatrically in the United States on April 22 to critical acclaim, with praise towards Eggers' direction, the screenplay, cinematography, visual effects, score and cast performances. While it underperformed at the worldwide box office, the film later found financial success at the VOD and other post-theatrical markets.[7][8]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn AD 895, King Aurvandill returns to the island of Hrafnsey, reuniting with his wife, Queen Gudr\u00fan, and his heir, Prince Amleth. To prepare Amleth for his eventual ascension, the father and son participate in a ceremony overseen by Aurvandill's jester, Heimir. Heimir tells Amleth that his destiny is fixed and cannot be escaped, and Amleth vows to avenge his father if Aurvandill is ever slain, rather than live his life in shame. The next morning, Amleth's bastard uncle Fj\u00f6lnir stages a palace coup, personally beheads Aurvandill, sacks the hillfort and carries away Gudr\u00fan. Amleth narrowly escapes Fj\u00f6lnir's assassins and flees by boat, swearing vengeance.\nSeveral years later, an adult Amleth is a berserker within a band of Vikings. After attacking a village in Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki, he encounters a Seeress in the temple of Svetovit; the Seeress orders Amleth to remember his oath of vengeance and tells him that his fate is intertwined with that of a Maiden-King. Soon after, he learns that \"Fj\u00f6lnir the Brotherless\" has lost his throne to Harald of Norway and now lives as a sheep farmer in Iceland. Branding himself as a slave, Amleth sneaks aboard a ship taking slaves to Iceland. He encounters an enslaved Slavic woman named Olga, who claims to be a sorceress. They are taken to Fj\u00f6lnir's farm, where Amleth learns his mother married Fj\u00f6lnir and bore him a son named Gunnar.\nOne night, Amleth follows a vixen and encounters a he-witch, who facilitates a seance between Amleth and the skull of Heimir, whom Fj\u00f6lnir has also murdered. Heimir tells Amleth about Draugr, a magical sword that can only be drawn at night or at the Gates of Hel. Amleth enters a barrow and obtains the blade from its owner, the undead Mound Dweller. He hides the sword upon his return to the farm. The next day, Amleth is selected to compete in a game of knattleikr against another farm. The game turns violent when the leader of the opposing team brutalizes the competition until only he and Amleth are left. Gunnar (looking up to Amleth, not knowing he is his half-brother), is almost killed in trying to draw away the opposing player; but Amleth saves him, furiously beating his opponent to death. As a reward, Fj\u00f6lnir's adult son, Thorir, grants him overseer duties and allows him to choose a woman.\nDuring the evening celebrations, Amleth and Olga make love; they promise to overcome Fj\u00f6lnir together. Over several nights Amleth kills prominent members of Fj\u00f6lnir's estate, and Olga mixes the food supply with fly agaric, a potent hallucinogen. Christian slaves are believed by Thorir to be responsible. This allows Amleth to enter Fj\u00f6lnir's house. Amleth reveals his identity to Gudr\u00fan, who replies that she was Aurvandill's slave and that Amleth was conceived by rape. Gudr\u00fan also reveals that she masterminded Fj\u00f6lnir's coup because she wanted both Aurvandill and Amleth dead; she then tries to seduce Amleth, who, after a moment, rejects her. Enraged, Amleth kills Thorir, and cuts out his heart.\nGudr\u00fan reveals Amleth's true identity to Fj\u00f6lnir and calls for Amleth's death. Fj\u00f6lnir decides to kill Olga, but Amleth offers to trade Olga's life for Thorir's heart. Amleth allows himself to be captured, and is tortured for the location of Thorir's heart. Amleth is released from his restraints by a flock of ravens sent by Odin and Olga rescues him. Amleth decides to abandon his quest for revenge, and the two decide to escape by boat to his kinsmen in the Orkney Islands. But aboard the vessel Amleth has a vision, and realizes that Olga is pregnant with twins, one of whom will be the Maiden-King prophesied by the Seeress. Realizing that Olga and their children will never be safe while Fj\u00f6lnir lives, Amleth, despite Olga's pleas, jumps overboard and swims ashore reasoning that he cannot escape his fate.\nBack at the farm, Amleth kills Fj\u00f6lnir's remaining men and frees the slaves. While searching for Fj\u00f6lnir, Amleth is attacked by Gudr\u00fan and Gunnar and kills them in self-defense after being wounded. Fj\u00f6lnir, discovering his wife and son dead, coldly tells Amleth to meet him at the Gates of Hel: the crater of the volcano Hekla. Amleth and Fj\u00f6lnir engage naked in a fierce Holmgang until Fj\u00f6lnir is beheaded and Amleth is simultaneously stabbed. As he dies, Amleth has a vision of Olga embracing their two children, whom she tells him are safe, before urging him to let go. A valkyrie carries Amleth through the gates of Valh\u00f6ll.\n\nCast[edit]\n(Clockwise from the top left) The Northman stars Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawke and Anya Taylor-Joy\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd as Amleth, a Viking warrior prince\nOscar Novak as young Amleth[9]\nNicole Kidman as Queen Gudr\u00fan, Amleth's mother\nClaes Bang as Fj\u00f6lnir the Brotherless, Amleth's uncle and Aurvandill's brother\nAnya Taylor-Joy as Olga of the Birch Forest, a Slavic sorceress\nEthan Hawke as King Aurvandill War-Raven, Amleth's father and Fj\u00f6lnir's brother\nGustav Lindh as Thorir the Proud, Fj\u00f6lnir's elder son and Amleth's cousin\nElliott Rose as Gunnar, Fj\u00f6lnir's younger son and Amleth's half-brother\nWillem Dafoe as Heimir the Fool\nBj\u00f6rk as the Seeress\nEldar Skar as Finnr the Nose-Stub, Fj\u00f6lnir's foreman\nPhill Martin as Hallgr\u00edmr Half-Troll\nOlwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 as Ashildur Hofgythja, the priestess of Fj\u00f6lnir's estate\nIngvar Eggert Sigur\u00f0sson as the He-witch\nIan Whyte as the Mound Dweller\nHaf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson as Thorfinnr Tooth-Gnasher, H\u00e1kon's champion\nKate Dickie as Halld\u00f3ra the Pict, a slave on Fj\u00f6lnir's farm\nTadhg Murphy as Eirikr Blaze-Eye, Amleth's fellow berserker\nRalph Ineson as Captain Volodymyr, a Rus sea captain\nMurray McArthur as H\u00e1kon Ironbeard, chieftain of the neighboring farm\nIneta \u0160liu\u017eait\u0117 as the Valkyrja\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nBorn to a Swedish family, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd had been fascinated with Viking history and mythology since childhood, and had long sought a Viking-themed project with the help of producer Lars Knudsen.[10] In 2011, Skarsg\u00e5rd was attached to a Warner Bros. epic with the working title The Vanguard, which ultimately did not materialize.[11] Robert Eggers became interested in making a Viking film following a 2016 trip to Iceland with his wife Alexandra Shaker, who is a fan of Old Norse sagas.[3] During the trip, Eggers met Bj\u00f6rk, who in turn introduced him to Sj\u00f3n.[12] In 2017, Skarsg\u00e5rd met Eggers to discuss future projects, but the discussion quickly turned to a Viking Age\u2013themed film.[10][13][14] Eggers subsequently reached out to Sj\u00f3n, and the two began researching and writing the screenplay.[12]\nThe story of The Northman was based primarily on the legend of Amleth as written by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, known as the direct inspiration for William Shakespeare's Hamlet.[15][16] Eggers cited the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda, Egil's Saga, Grettir's Saga, the Eyrbyggja saga and the Saga of Hrolfr Kraki as additional influences.[15]  Archaeologist Neil Price at Uppsala University, folklorist Terry Gunnell at the University of Iceland and Viking historian J\u00f3hanna Katr\u00edn Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir served as historical consultants on the film.[17][3] Eggers also acknowledged 1982's Conan the Barbarian as a source of inspiration.[15]\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Eggers would direct an epic Viking revenge saga, which he would also co-write with Sj\u00f3n. Skarsg\u00e5rd, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd (Alexander's brother) and Willem Dafoe were in talks to join the film.[18] They would all be confirmed in December, along with the addition of Claes Bang to the cast.[19] The film was officially in preparation in December 2019, and would begin filming in Belfast in 2020.[20][21] In August 2020, Bj\u00f6rk, along with her daughter \u00cdsad\u00f3ra \"Doa\" Barney,[22] Kate Dickie and Ethan Hawke joined the cast of the film.[23][24][25] In September 2020, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd announced he had dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced with Gustav Lindh.[26]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography was to begin in March 2020,[27] but it was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[28] Filming, most of which took place in Northern Ireland, started in August 2020[29] and wrapped early in December, lasting 87 days.[30] King Aurvandill's village was constructed at Torr Head on the coast of County Antrim, while Fj\u00f6lnir's farm was built at Knockdhu near Larne. The scenes in the Land of the Rus were filmed at Portglenone, the Clandeboye Estate, Shane's Castle and on the River Bann. The Hightown quarry outside Belfast stood for the volcano Hekla, where the film's climactic fight takes place.[31] Brief sequences were filmed in Iceland at the Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull glacier and the town of Akureyri.[32]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nThe film cost between $70\u201390 million to produce, which was higher than its original $65 million budget. Eggers found the editing process to be the most difficult of his career. Feedback from test screenings indicated that the film's first act was too slow. More feedback showed that audiences found the Old Norse dialogue difficult to understand, which resulted in most of it being replaced in ADR sessions. The final cut was eventually approved on November 3, 2021.[3][2]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: The Northman (soundtrack)\nFor the film's score, Eggers brought former Tri Angle record label artists, Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough a.k.a. Vessel, for composition and production. They researched extensively on the history of Vikings music, including discussions with ethnographer Poul H\u00f8xbro,[33] and used instruments based on Nordic folk music, such as tagelharpa, langspil, kravik lyre, and s\u00e4ckpipa. They further experimented with the instruments they had, to create that ethnic Nordic sound,[34] which includes the 40-member string ensemble mimicking the sound of an archaic instrument called bullroarer.[35]\nThe score album was released by Back Lot Music on April 15, 2022, and featured 43 tracks.[36] On July 1, Sacred Bones Records released the album in CD, vinyl and cassettes.[37][38]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe film's advertising campaign briefly attracted notoriety due to a series of posters commissioned for the New York subway system that neglected to include the film's title.[39] Within a day of the subject going viral on Twitter, the posters were removed.[40] The film's advertising campaign additionally sponsored an episode of the web series Death Battle, with the midway segment of the episode featuring its characters interacting with the film and one of its axes.[41]\n\nTie-in media[edit]\nA 160-page book written by Simon Abrams and Eggers about the film's production and research, titled The Northman: A Call to the Gods, was originally scheduled to be released on September 6, 2022, but was later pushed back to November 8.[42][43]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nThe Northman was originally scheduled to be released on April 8, 2022,[44] but was later pushed back to April 22. It was distributed by Focus Features in United States and by Universal Pictures internationally.[45] Special screenings were held in several cities worldwide ahead of the theatrical release: in Stockholm at Rigoletto Cinema on March 28,[46] in Hamburg at Astor Film Lounge on March 30,[47] in Rome at Cinema Troisi on April 1,[48] in London at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on April 5,[49] in Belfast at Cineworld on April 6[50] and in Los Angeles at TCL Chinese Theatre on April 18.[51] Wide releases began early in some countries: on April 13 in Denmark, Norway and Sweden; on April 14 in Czech Republic, Ecuador, Iceland, Mexico, Montenegro, Netherlands, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Uruguay; and on April 15 in the United Kingdom and Lithuania.[5]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe Northman was released on VOD on May 13, 2022, on digital on June 6, 2022, and on Blu-ray, DVD and Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 7, 2022, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment in the United States.[52][53]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe Northman grossed $34.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $35.4 million in other territories \u2013 for a worldwide total of $69.6 million.[4][5]\nIn the U.S. and Canada, The Northman was released alongside The Bad Guys and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and was projected to gross $8\u201315 million from 3,223 theaters in its opening weekend.[2][54][55] It made $5 million on its first day, including $1.4 million from Thursday night previews. The film went on to debut to $12.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office.[56] Deadline Hollywood noted that The Northman and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent were targeting the same demographic, which impacted their debuts.[57] The film earned $6.4 million in its second weekend, finishing fourth;[58] $2.9 million in its third weekend, finishing sixth;[59] $1.75 million in its fourth weekend, finishing seventh;[60] and $1.1 million in its fifth weekend, finishing 10th.[61] It dropped out of the box office top 10 in its sixth weekend with $249,660.[62]\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, the film earned $3.4 million from 15 international markets in its opening weekend.[63] It made $6.3 million in its second weekend after expanding to 41 markets,[64] $4.5 million in its third weekend,[65] $2.2 million in its fourth,[66] $2.5 million in its fifth,[67] $2.9 million in its sixth,[68] and $1.4 million in its seventh.[69]\n\nHome media performance[edit]\nEggers commented on the film's underwhelming box office, stating that \"[The film] met the expectations of a bad marketplace ... Am I disappointed that, three to four weeks in, we're on VOD because that's the way things are done in the post-COVID world? Yeah. But it's doing great on VOD, so there you go.\"[70] In its debut weekend on PVOD in the U.S., the film was the top-rented title on iTunes, third on Vudu and fourth on Google Play, making about the same amount of revenue as The Bad Guys and The Lost City, despite grossing much less than both in theaters. IndieWire wrote that \"The Northman looks like the type of film that, even with lower theatrical returns, is greatly elevated by that exposure.\"[71] The following week, it finished third on the iTunes and Vudu charts, and fifth on Google Play.[72]\nIn its debut week on the DVD/Blu-ray market, the film debuted at the No. 1 spot on both the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart (which tracks combined DVD and Blu-ray disc unit sales) and the Blu-ray disc sales chart for the week ending June 11, 2022.[73][74]\nDeadline Hollywood reported the film lost \"a few single digits millions,\"[75] though Focus Features' president of production and acquisitions, Kiska Higgs, later stated that the film did become profitable despite press speculations.[7]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90% based on 372 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A bloody revenge epic and breathtaking visual marvel, The Northman finds filmmaker Robert Eggers expanding his scope without sacrificing any of his signature style.\"[76] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 based on sixty critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[77] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak gave it a 75% positive score (with an average 3.5 out of five stars), with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it.[57]\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave a five out of five score, praising the film's nihilistic tone and performances by the cast, stating, \"It's entirely outrageous, with some epic visions of the flaring cosmos. I couldn't look away.\"[78] Digital Spy's Gabriella Geisinger also gave a five out of five score, praising Eggers's visionary direction and the film's grisly and surreal atmosphere and claiming, \"The world created in The Northman is so totally absorbing\".[79] MovieZine's Alexander Kardelo gave the film a four out of five score and particularly praised Skarsg\u00e5rd's performance and Eggers' direction.[80] IndieWire's David Ehrlich called the film \"primal, sinewy, gnarly-as-fuck,\" \"grab-you-by-the-throat intense\" and \"never dull.\"[81] Games Radar's Matt Maytum commented that the film is a \"truly distinctive, unmissable epic\" in his review, ultimately giving it a five out of five stars.[82] The Independent's Clarrise Loughrey gave it five out of five stars, and stated in her review that the film was a \"beautiful risk\".[83] RogerEbert.com's Robert Daniels gave it three out of four, and praised the direction, cinematography and cast performances, but found that the film \"often stumbles when it searches for profundity.\"[84] The Austin Chronicle's Richard Whittaker called the film an \"extraordinary feat of cinema,\" commending the direction.[85] The New York Times's A.O. Scott praised the world-building and cinematography, writing, \"Eggers's accomplishment lies in his fastidious, fanatical rendering of that world, down to its bed linens and cooking utensils.\"[86] The New Yorker's Richard Brody found that the film \"offers no synesthesia, no evocation of any sense beside vision\" and criticized Eggers's direction, ultimately concluding, \"The Northman merely serves up its raw material both half-baked and overcooked.\"[87] Rolling Stone's K. Austin Collins wrote that \"It's an oft-stunning visual feast,\" but added, \"It is also an instructive example of how the most visionary intentions can't always enliven an otherwise rote story.\"[88]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward ceremony\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards\n\nJuly 1, 2022\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe Northman\n\nNominated\n\n[89]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nRobert Eggers\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy\n\nNominated\n\n\nLocation Managers Guild Awards\n\nAugust 27, 2022\n\nOutstanding Locations in a Period Film\n\nThor Kjartansson, Naomi Liston, and Gordon Wycherley\n\nNominated\n\n[90]\n\n\nSaturn Awards\n\nOctober 25, 2022\n\nBest Thriller Film\n\nThe Northman\n\nNominated\n\n[91]\n\n\nChicago Film Critics Association Awards\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nLinda Muir\n\nNominated\n\n[92]\n\n\nDublin Film Critics' Circle Awards\n\nDecember 15, 2022\n\nBest Director\n\nRobert Eggers\n\nNominated\n\n[93]\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nJarin Blaschke\n\nNominated\n\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society Awards\n\nJanuary 6, 2023\n\nSpecial Award for Body of Work\n\nEthan Hawke[a]\n\nRunner-up\n\n[94]\n\n\nSeattle Film Critics Society Awards\n\nJanuary 17, 2023\n\nBest Action Choreography\n\nThe Northman\n\nNominated\n\n[95]\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nLinda Muir\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nNiamh Coulter (set decoration) and Craig Lathrop (production design)\n\nNominated\n\n\nInternational Film Music Critics Association Awards\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nBest Original Score for an Action/Adventure Film\n\nRobert Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough\n\nNominated\n\n[96]\n\n\nCritics' Choice Super Awards\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\nBest Science Fiction/Fantasy Movie\n\nThe Northman\n\nNominated\n\n[97]\n\n\nBest Actor in a Science Fiction/Fantasy Movie\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\n\nNominated\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Also for The Black Phone, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and Raymond & Ray\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Northman (15)\".
