It is a legacy sequel to A Christmas Story (1983) and is the eighth installment in the Parker Family Saga franchise, while ignoring the events of My Summer Story (1994) and A Christmas Story 2 (2012).[citation needed] The film was produced by Billingsley and Vince Vaughn along with Cale Boyter, Jay Ashenfelter, Marc Toberoff and Irwin Zwilling. Billingsley reprises his role as Ralphie Parker alongside Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz, R. D. Robb, Zack Ward, and Yano Anaya returning as Randy, Flick, Schwartz, Scut Farkus, and Grover Dill respectively. Erinn Hayes, River Drosche, and Julianna Layne play Ralphie's wife and kids, with Julie Hagerty (replacing Melinda Dillon from the original film) as Mrs. Parker. In the film, after the Old Man dies, Ralphie takes his family to his childhood home, reuniting with his mother and old friends, while being tasked to deliver a memorable Christmas.\nA Christmas Story Christmas was released in the United States on November 17, 2022, on HBO Max.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn December 1973, 33 years after the events of A Christmas Story, 42-year-old Ralph \"Ralphie\" Parker lives in Chicago with his wife, Sandy, and two children, Mark and Julie. Ralph has been taking the year off from his job to write his first novel, but its excessive length leads multiple publishers to reject it. Mrs. Parker calls to tell Ralph that his father, \"the Old Man\", has died, and the grief-stricken family makes its way to Hohman, Indiana to be with her. She gives Ralph two tasks: write his father's obituary, and take up his mantle of making Christmas special for the family.\nRalph's children befriend one of the Bumpus kids next door, and have their snowman smashed by two bullies on a snowmobile. Ralph reunites with Flick, who now owns his father's old tavern, and Schwartz, who still lives with his mother and has run up a large tab at Flick's. While leaving the house to go ice skating, Sandy slips and sprains her ankle.\nAs Christmas Eve approaches, the family goes to Higbee's, where Ralph miraculously buys everything Mark and Julie asked for while the children speak to the store's Santa. On the way back, Ralph's car overheats, and Ralph accidentally hits Julie in the eye during an impromptu snowball fight. After Julie receives a temporary eyepatch at the hospital, the family discovers their car was robbed in the hospital parking lot; the presents are gone, and there is little money left to replace them.\nBack at Flick's, Flick offers to forgive Schwartz's tab if he sleds off a giant ramp; Schwartz manages to complete the stunt, but Mark breaks his arm sledding down the nearby hill afterwards. After Ralph is rejected by his final prospective publisher, he laments his difficulties, but is encouraged by his mother and Sandy. Remembering his favorite Christmas with his father inspires Ralph to write a long article instead of a standard obituary; however, he leaves it on the desk, needing to prepare for Christmas Day. Mark and Julie manage to get back at their bullies by building a snowman over a tree stump so that the snowmobile crashes.\nOn Christmas Eve night, the star falls off the Parker's tree and breaks, upsetting Julie. Frustrated, Ralph ignores objections from his wife and his mother and goes out to find a new star. All the local businesses are already closed, so Ralph breaks into Flick's tavern to \"borrow\" the star from the tree. On his way out, he is apprehended by Scut Farkus, now a Hohman police officer. Ralph is terrified of what Scut might do to him, but Scut brings him home, saying he owes Ralph because their childhood fight set him on a better path in life. \nMrs. Parker goes into the basement to change a fuse and finds several thoughtfully-picked, pre-wrapped gifts, which the Old Man had bought shortly before his death. On Christmas morning, the family is delighted to open them, and all their other presents as well. Ralph is confused by compliments he receives about his piece in the newspaper, and Sandy reveals she found the obituary manuscript and took it to the local paper because of its high quality. The phone rings, and Ralph is offered a new job as a syndicated columnist, fulfilling his dream of becoming a full-time writer. Much of the town comes to the Parker house for Christmas dinner; after dinner concludes, the core family asks Ralph to read them his story about the Old Man. Ralph takes a seat in his father's armchair and begins reading, and his narration slowly transitions into Jean Shepherd's opening narration from the first film.\n\nCast[edit]\nPeter Billingsley as Ralph \"Ralphie\" Parker\nErinn Hayes as Sandy Parker, Ralph's wife\nJulie Hagerty as Mrs. Parker, Ralph's mother She was previously portrayed by Melinda Dillon in A Christmas Story\nIan Petrella as Randy Parker, Ralph's younger brother\nScott Schwartz as Flick, one of Ralph's childhood friends\nR.

Pictures and Legendary Pictures announced that a legacy sequel to A Christmas Story was in development with a script from Nick Schenk who also is executive producer.[2] Clay Kaytis was hired to direct.[3] The film is dedicated to the memory of Darren McGavin (who played Ralphie's Old Man in the original film), who died in 2006 at the age of 83.[4]\nShortly after the official announcement of the film, Peter Billingsley was cast to reprise his role as Ralphie Parker as an adult, in addition to being a producer alongside Vince Vaughn.[3] Julie Hagerty was cast as Mrs. Parker,[5] since Melinda Dillon (who had played the role in A Christmas Story) was in poor health at the time of the film's production and ultimately died less than two months after the film was released.[6]\nThe following month, Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz, R. D. Robb, Zack Ward, and Yano Anaya were cast to reprise their roles as Randy Parker, Flick, Schwartz, Scut Farkus, and Grover Dill, respectively.[7] Erinn Hayes, River Drosche, and Julianna Layne were cast as Ralphie's wife, Sandy Parker, and his kids, Mark and Julie Parker, respectively.[8]\nPrincipal photography began in late February 2022 in Hungary and Bulgaria.[9] Billingsley and the crew commissioned exact replicas of the house which was depicted in the original film and of the neighborhood.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe first teaser trailer was released in October 2022, confirming the official release date,[11] with the full trailer following on November 1.[12] The film was released in the United States on November 17, streaming on HBO Max by Warner Bros. Pictures.[1][13][14]\nThe film made its linear television debut during the 2023 holiday season with airings on Warner Bros.-owned networks TNT and TBS.[15]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was released on DVD by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on October 31, 2023.[16]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of 48 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"It isn't as much fun as an official Red Ryder carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time, but A Christmas Story Christmas remains a sequel worth celebrating.\"[17] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[18]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Christmas films\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b D'Alessandro, Anthony (August 24, 2022). \"HBO Max Dates Four Holiday Movies Including Sequel 'A Christmas Story Christmas'\".
