Shoddy camera work, murky lighting, and a grating score hinder what could have been impactful. A puzzling climax also makes little sense after a long build up.\"[8]\nSergio Pereira of Comic Book Resources also gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"Despite the cast's best efforts and the noir gloss on display, Confidential Informant surrenders to lackluster editing, flawed logic, and the clich\u00e9s.\"[9]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nAt the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor for Mel Gibson.[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Nash, Anthony (June 7, 2023). \"Confidential Informant Trailer Previews Mel Gibson Crime Thriller\".
