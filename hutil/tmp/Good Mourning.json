And the timing couldn't be worse because the most important meeting of his career is scheduled for later that same day. Compounded by chaotic roommates, and wildly unpredictable twists and turns, London's day keeps going downhill until ultimately, he is forced to choose between pursuing his one true love and landing a life-changing, starring role in a major motion picture.\nGood Mourning was theatrically released on May 20, 2022, through Open Road Films. The film received mainly negative reviews from critics, and its box office was negatively impacted at the time of the release. It was nominated for 43rd Golden Raspberry Awards, winning Worst Director for Baker and Mod Sun.  \n\n\nPlot[edit]\nActor London Clash wakes up to text messages from his girlfriend, Apple, including an apology and the phrase \u2018good mourning.\u2019 He is unable to reach her, and worries that the messages are a breakup. Compounding his stress are the arrival of his new assistant, Olive, and a role in a new Batman film that he is waiting to hear about. He manages to make contact with Apple, but their conversation is interrupted when Trippie Redd hits him with a water balloon, breaking his phone. London, along with friends Angel and Leo, break into Apple\u2019s house looking for her, only to shatter urns containing her cremated relatives. Angel proposes using cannabis ash to replace the remains, and the three embark on a heavy smoking session with the help of their friends Dylan, Fat Joe and Kennedy. \nOlive provides London with a new phone, which he uses to get in touch with Apple. However, when his friends return to Apple\u2019s house to replace the urns, they see her leaving the house with another man. London skips a meeting with the director of the Batman movie to meet Apple at a Van Nuys airport. He is knocked out by the unknown man, which is filmed by Dennis Rodman, but is rescued and treated by his stalker, Sabrina. Meanwhile, Leo attends the meeting in London\u2019s place, wearing a mask to conceal his identity. In the middle of the meeting, he and Dylan are arrested after being spotted leaving Apple\u2019s house.\nLondon makes it home to find Apple waiting, who reveals that the mysterious man was her stylist, and the \u2018good mourning\u2019 text was simply a typo. Furious at London for his behavior, she breaks up with him, and Maxine fires him as a client. After bailing Dylan and Leo out of jail, the group heads to a party Apple is attending YG\u2019s house, but are unable to get in. After getting Fat Joe out of a k-hole, they travel to a late night diner. Olive arrives with Maxine on the phone, who tells London that the viral video of him getting punched in the face has landed him the Batman role. He calls Apple, who agrees to meet him at the site of their first kiss. However, while texting and driving, he crashes into Apple, landing the two of them in the same hospital room together.\nA post-credits scene appears to indicate that the events of the film were in fact an episode of a television show, with London Clash (played by a British actor) a character.\n\nCast[edit]\nMachine Gun Kelly as London Clash\nMod Sun as Dylan\nBecky G as Apple\nDove Cameron as Olive\nGaTa as Leo\nZach Villa as Angel\nJenna Boyd as Sabrina the Stalker\nBoo Johnson as Fat Joe\nAmber Rose as Weed Girl\nAvril Lavigne as herself\nDennis Rodman as Basketball Cameo\nRickey Thompson as Workout Demon\nTom Arnold as Famous Director\nWhitney Cummings as Maxine\nMegan Fox as Kennedy\nPete Davidson as Berry\nAdin Ross as Airport Worker\nDanny Trejo as Method Cameo\nYG as Party Cameo\nTrippie Redd as Pool Guest\nBrittany Furlan as Waitress\nSnoop Dogg as The Joint\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 0% rating based on reviews from 7 critics.[4]\nJeffrey Anderson of Common Sense Media gave it 2 out of 5 and wrote: \"without help from outside substances, this showbiz/stoner comedy doesn't really offer anything we haven't seen before and never achieves more than a mild chuckle.\"[5]\n\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, the film earned $16,010 from 28 theaters in its opening weekend.[6] In total the film has grossed $21,348.[1]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nAt the 43rd Golden Raspberry Awards, the film received seven nominations: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor (for Kelly), Worst Supporting Actor (for Sun and for Davidson), Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Combo (for Kelly and Sun), winning Worst Director.\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nResult\n\nRecipient\n\n\n2023[7]\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n\nWorst Picture\n\nNominated\n\nChris Long, Machine Gun Kelly, Jib Polhemus, and Mod Sun\n\n\nWorst Director\n\nWon\n\nMachine Gun Kelly and Mod Sun\n\n\nWorst Actor\n\nNominated\n\nMachine Gun Kelly\n\n\nWorst Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\nPete Davidson\n\n\nNominated\n\nMod Sun\n\n\nWorst Screen Combo\n\nNominated\n\nMachine Gun Kelly and Mod Sun\n\n\nWorst Screenplay\n\nNominated\n\n\"written\" by Machine Gun Kelly and Mod Sun\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Good Mourning\".
