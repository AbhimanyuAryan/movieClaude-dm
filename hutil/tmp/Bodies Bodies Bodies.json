        "Bee, a working-class young woman from Eastern Europe, travels with her wealthy girlfriend Sophie to a \"hurricane party\" at a mansion owned by the family of David, Sophie's friend. Other guests include David's aspiring actress girlfriend Emma, the podcaster Alice, her much-older new boyfriend Greg and the enigmatic Jordan. Max, another guest, left after a fight with David the night before Sophie and Bee arrived.",
        "After drinking, using drugs and dancing, the group decides to play \"Bodies Bodies Bodies\", a murder in the dark-style game. Greg goes to bed early due to hostility throughout the game from David, who also leaves soon after another fight with Emma. As the storm worsens, the power goes out and the girls scramble to find a power source. Minutes later, Bee finds David outside with his throat slashed, a blood-stained kukri nearby. Panicked and without reception, the group try to go for help in Sophie's car but find its battery dead.",
        "The group discovers Greg has a go bag with a knife and a map of the area and become suspicious of him. They fearfully confront Greg, who returns their hostility. After a struggle, Bee bludgeons him to death with a kettle bell.",
        "The group doubt that Greg was the killer and Emma theorizes that Max, who had confessed feelings for her the night before, returned to kill David. Sophie, a sober addict, relapses. Emma kisses her, to Sophie's confusion, before accepting drugs. Alice later finds Emma dead from a head wound at the bottom of the stairs, and believes the group is being killed one by one. Jordan and Alice cast suspicion on Bee, revealing that no one with her name is on record as having graduated from her college; they cast Bee out into the hurricane.",
        "Returning to Sophie's car, Bee finds underwear that matches Jordan's bra in the backseat. She sees Jordan holding David's father's gun through a window, then crawls back inside through a pet door. Bee confronts the group, revealing that she dropped out of college to take care of her mother, who has borderline personality disorder. A vicious verbal fight ensues between the group. Jordan, who was the \"killer\" in the Bodies Bodies Bodies game, reveals resentment for Sophie due to her drug addiction and using David to regain access to her trust fund and claims Sophie cheated on Bee with her, which Sophie denies. Sophie expresses why she would not date Jordan, that she avoids her friends because their behavior challenges her sobriety and reveals that Jordan only \"hate-listens\" to Alice's podcast. After Alice responds by insulting Jordan's insecurities, Jordan shoots Alice in the leg. A struggle for the gun follows; Alice is fatally shot in the throat. As Sophie and Jordan fight, Bee pushes Jordan over the staircase bannister. With her dying breath, Jordan tells Bee to check Sophie's text messages. Bee hides from Sophie out of distrust.",
        "When morning comes and the storm has blown over, Sophie tearfully confesses to Bee that she relapsed and witnessed Emma tripping and falling down the stairs to her death. However, Bee holds her at gunpoint, demanding to see her texts. Sophie tosses her phone away and they struggle, inadvertently picking up David's phone in the process, which shows that David accidentally slashed his own throat while trying to use the kukri to open a champagne bottle for a TikTok video\u2014revealing there was no real murderer after all. As Bee and Sophie realize the bloodshed was all for nothing, a confused Max returns to the mansion, and the power comes back on. When Max asks what happened, Bee only says that she now has service on her phone."

        "In March 2018, A24 acquired Bodies, Bodies, Bodies, a spec script written by Kristen Roupenian. In September 2019, it was announced Chloe Okuno would re-write the script and direct the film. In April 2021, it was reported that Amandla Stenberg and Maria Bakalova were set to star in the film, while Pete Davidson and Myha'la Herrold were in talks to join the cast, with Halina Reijn now set to direct. Bakalova said she was scared to be in a horror film, having been frightened watching them, but thought that A24 films were deeper; she said that the film was \"more like an R-rated comedy.\" In May 2021, actors Lee Pace, Rachel Sennott, Chase Sui Wonders, and Conner O'Malley joined the film, with Davidson and Herrold's casting also being confirmed.",
        "Principal photography began in May 2021, with filming taking place at a Georgian stone manor house in Chappaqua, New York.",

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 233 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Impeccably cast and smartly written, Bodies Bodies Bodies is an uncommonly well-done whodunnit.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an average 3 out of 5 stars, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Abby Olcese for RogerEbert.com praised the use of music and cinematography to enhance the single-location setting. Bloody Disgusting found the social satire of the movie, and its use of setting to highlight this, to be strong. Lovia Gyarkye for The Hollywood Reporter found the film to be a psychological study of the friendship archetypes and the digital age, while also showing an understanding of the anxieties of twenty-somethings, praising the story. IndieWire's Robert Daniels wrote that Reijn's direction was the strongest part of the film, while also praising the script for its social interrogation. Erin Brady of Little White Lies instead thought that the film fell apart towards the end because it is \"a movie that claims to understand how Gen-Z treats societal topics ... [while] portraying some of those topics so stereotypically.\" However, she said that the film was well paced and it was hard to resist the fun of it. IGN's Rafael Motamayor wrote that \"it does falter somewhat when it comes to Gen Z talk ... like someone had a bunch of placeholders they swapped in with whatever term a teenager told them kids use these days,\" though also felt it was good overall.",
        "Valerie Complex at Deadline Hollywood praised the cast, saying \"each actor [has] their own style that brings a varied flavor to the film, which makes the cast ... a joy to watch, even if their characters are insufferable,\" and Owen Gleiberman for Variety praised the directing for giving the characters and actors room to explore. Complex and Daniels said that the characters as written are weak, but the performances all elevate them. Sennott was consistently named the standout performance of the film, while Brady said this was Herrold's. Gyarkye wrote that nobody could deny the acting talent, noting Herrold as well as Stenberg. Daniels highlighted Sennott and Davidson, while Marya E. Gates of The Playlist commended the ensemble while noting Davidson and Bakalova. Paste's Aurora Amidon felt that the cast were all successful, but that Bakalova's comedic talents were wasted by playing a serious character.",
        "Gleiberman described the film as \"And Then There Were None staged by John Cassavetes for the age of Instagram.\" Gates felt that some scenes ran too long, but said that the film is \"destined to [take] its place on the mantle with seminal horror-comedy faves like Jennifer's Body and Scream\"; Gyarkye instead said that the film may not appeal to slasher genre fans. Eileen Jones of Jacobin gave a negative review of the film, summarizing: \"Like so many horror films attempting to be subversive, Bodies Bodies Bodies tries to satirize the upper class. But all it delivers are tired, lazy tropes about Gen Z.\"",
        "Bodies Bodies Bodies was the subject of controversy online following a review published in The New York Times by Lena Wilson that criticized the film's sexuality. \"Young, hot people get trapped in a remote locale and are picked off one by one. The hotties in question are a group of twenty-somethings embittered by lifelong friendship,\" Wilson wrote. She continued, \"The only thing that really sets 'Bodies Bodies Bodies' apart is its place in the A24 hype machine, where it doubles as a 95-minute advertisement for cleavage and Charli XCX's latest single.\" Stenberg sent the critic a direct message on Instagram, saying, \"Your review was great. Maybe if you had gotten your eyes off my tits you would've watched the movie!\" Wilson posted a screenshot of the interaction, featuring her response to Stenberg as well, on her Twitter account. \"Do you think she instagram DM'd Alison Willmore, Justin Chang, and Anthony Lane like this or,\" she wrote in her tweet.",
        "The tweet generated backlash on Twitter against both Stenberg and Wilson. On her TikTok, Wilson, who identifies as a lesbian film critic, further criticized Stenberg's response, accusing her of homophobia. Stenberg said on her own TikTok account that she was only trying to be funny and ask an earnest question in private, which she did not expect to be aired in public. Stenberg also said that Wilson's comment aligned with comments Stenberg had heard about her own body: \"It's quite surprising the amount of commentary I receive on my boobs. I wore this tank top in this movie because me and the costume designer felt it fit the character well. I do get tired of people talking about my chest. There seems to be a lot of unwarranted conversation about my chest.\" Wilson deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts shortly after her tweet went viral."
