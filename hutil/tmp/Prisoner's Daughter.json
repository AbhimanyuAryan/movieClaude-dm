Wendy Ide of Screen Daily wrote that \"There are very few surprises in this formulaic domestic drama, but there are pleasures to be had in watching.\"",
        "Robert Daniels, in a review for RogerEbert.com, gave the film a mostly negative review, writing that it \"disappointingly undermines its own themes and characters at every turn.\"",
        "Marya E. Gates of The Playlist was critical of the film, stating that the performances of Cox and Beckinsale were some of the film's only highlights."
