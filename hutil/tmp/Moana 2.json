        "In December 2020, during a Disney Investor Day meeting, Walt Disney Animation Studios chief creative officer Jennifer Lee announced that a musical series titled Moana, based on the 2016 film of the same name, was in development at the studio for Disney+. By August 2021, it was reported that Osnat Shurer would once again serve as producer. In January 2022, it was announced that David G. Derrick Jr. would serve as the writer and director, after previously filling the role of storyboard artist of the first film. He will be the first Samoan filmmaker for a Walt Disney Animation Studios project. The series entered development simultaneously with the live action remake of Moana according to Jared Bush, a writer of the film and screenplay writer of the 2016 animated film.",
        "In February 2024, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the series had been reworked into a theatrical sequel, with Derrick and Shurer remaining attached to the project.",
        "Shortly after the announcement that the series was being repurposed into a theatrical feature film, Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson were confirmed to reprise their respective roles as Moana and Maui. Johnson later confirmed that he had been involved with the project since its conception, including its development, stating: \"I can't wait for fans to see the film, the technology, the effects, cutting edge. We all really went for it. We thought if we're gonna make a sequel to something so beloved, let's really go for it.\"",
        "Animation was handled at Walt Disney Animation Studios' Vancouver studio beginning when it was being developed as a series, while pre-production and storyboarding took place at the Burbank studio. It is the first feature film to be made at the Vancouver studio, but not the first project released, with Iw\u00e1j\u00fa being released earlier that year.",
        "Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa\u02bbi will return to compose the film score while Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear will be credited as the songwriters, replacing Lin-Manuel Miranda from the first film."
