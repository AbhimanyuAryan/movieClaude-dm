Ross, and Brendan Walsh.[3][4] It stars Genesis Rodriguez and Vincent Piazza.[5]\nThe story is about an American man and his pregnant wife who become trapped in their car when a storm buries them underneath layers of snow and ice in Norway. As supplies dwindle and temperatures plunge, the couple must battle the elements and hypothermia in a desperate fight for survival.\nCentigrade was released by IFC Midnight to limited theatres and video on demand on August 28, 2020.[6][7][8]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 2002, a young American couple, Naomi and Matthew travel to the arctic mountains of Norway. After pulling over during a snowstorm, they wake up trapped in their SUV, buried underneath layers of snow and Ice. It is revealed that Naomi is eight months pregnant. They struggle to survive as the temperature drops to dangerous levels and they encounter unforeseen obstacles in their battle to stay alive. With few resources, a dwindling food supply, and nothing but time, tension, blame, and personal secrets bubble to the surface. Matthew and Naomi realize they must work together to survive in a crippling battle against the elements, hypothermia, disturbing hallucinations, and plunging temperatures.\nAfter suffering a panic attack, Naomi goes into labor. Matt helps his wife with the delivery of their baby girl. Naomi suggests they name her Olivia (Liv for short) to which Matt agrees. Matt continues to suffer from hypothermia and frostbite while he is trying to dig through the window.\nNaomi struggles to calm her newborn daughter and Matt offers his coat to help keep the baby warm. The next morning, Naomi awakens to find Matt has died from hypothermia. Days later, Naomi awakens with drops of water on her face. After checking the window, she discovers that the ice is finally soft enough to break through. She grabs her belongings, wraps up the baby, and manages to escape from the vehicle.\nAfter hours of wandering in the wilderness, Naomi finally finds a remote hotel on the outskirts of civilization.\nBefore the credits roll, it is revealed that Naomi and Olivia were taken to a local hospital and treated for dehydration, hypothermia, frostbite and severe malnourishment. Experts believe they survived due to the \"igloo effect\", shielding them from the elements, and trapping in any heat they produced.\n\nCast[edit]\nGenesis Rodriguez as Naomi Ibbotson.\nVincent Piazza as Matt Ibbotson\nBenjamin Sokolow as Baby Liv\nEmily Bayiokos as Baby Liv\nProduction[edit]\nThe original screenplay by Daley Nixon was based on the real-life case of Peter Skyllberg, a Swedish man who was pulled barely alive from his snow-covered car having survived on nothing but snow for two months in sub-zero temperatures.[9] The script was found and optioned through the website InkTip in 2017.[10] The film was shot in sequence. Both actors lost 20lbs during filming.[11]\nPrincipal photography occurred in Staten Island and Norway in 2018 and 2019.[12][13]\nAccording to star Vincent Piazza \"They got two of the identical automobiles. They cut them in different ways so that they can move the camera in unique positions throughout the shoot to create a visual variety and they parked them in an ice cream freezer in Staten Island. They were able to control the temperature, so that was real. There were no gags or gimmicks. It was all real cold that we were enduring.\"[14]\n\nRelease[edit]\nCentigrade premiered at the Sidewalk Film Festival on August 27, 2020.[15] The film's first trailer premiered via Entertainment Weekly on July 23, 2020.[16] The film also showed as the Midnight Horror Special at the Sarasota Film Festival in May, 2021.[17]\n\nBox office[edit]\nCentigrade has grossed $31,808 at the global box office.\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nCritics gave the film mixed to negative reviews with a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 5.7/10.
