Michael Therkelsen at Horror Society gave it a 6 out of 10, stating that the \"special effects and scenes of torture\" save the movie. AJ Friar at Infamous Horrors gave it 3 out of 5 stating that it is a unique film but the script could be tighter. Dante Yurei of 10th Circle scored it 4 out of 10, claiming it will get the \"attention of gorehounds.\" David Garrett at Dark Discussions said most of the story was boring and needed more development scoring it 3.5 out of 10. Bloodbath and Beyond gave the film 1 out of 5. Jim Morazzini at Voices From The Balcony scored it a 1 out of 5 calling it a \"torture porn\" splatter film and that \"feels like a bad attempt at a Rob Zombie film.\" Andrew Welsh scored it an F, claiming \"you won\u2019t find any low budget, indie horror movie charm here.\" FilmTv said it had disastrous direction which simulates the terrible mockumentary."
