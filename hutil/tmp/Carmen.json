        "In May 2017, Benjamin Millepied was set to make his feature film directorial debut with the film version of Carmen for Chapter 2, originally conceived as \"a modern-day reimagining of one of the world's most celebrated operas\". Once completed, Millepied recognized his film was less an adaptation than \"a version of Bizet's tragedy from a parallel universe\". Lo\u00efc Barr\u00e8re\u00a0[fr] and Millepied will write the script. In May 2019, Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights for the film and Nilo Cruz would write the script. In November 2020, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. was revealed to have co-written the script with Millepied and Lo\u00efc Barr\u00e8re.",
        "In May 2019, it was announced that Melissa Barrera and Jamie Dornan were cast as Carmen and Aidan, respectively. In November 2020, Paul Mescal replaced Dornan and Rossy de Palma was cast in the film.",
        "Principal photography commenced on 18 January 2021 in Australia with J\u00f6rg Widmer as the cinematographer, and wrapped in early March 2021."
