        "Leo Scott initially began working as an editor with Harmony Korine on his short film The Lotus Community Workshop, where he came across Val Kilmer's archive, digging through 800 hours of footage, with Ting Poo boarding the project later on. The footage, which Kilmer had shot for years, featured him growing up, attending school, auditioning, his career, and family. Previously, the footage had sat in boxes for years, and once Kilmer was diagnosed with cancer and began losing his voice, it made him want to tell his story. The film is narrated by Kilmer's own words, through his son Jack Kilmer.",
        "In May 2021, it was announced that Amazon Studios had acquired the US and Latin American rights for Val."
