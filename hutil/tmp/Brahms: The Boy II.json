Liza's husband suggests they relocate to the countryside to recuperate. The family move to a manor.",
        "They explore the property, and Jude finds a porcelain doll buried in the ground. Liza and Sean explore a nearby mansion. Liza searches for him and finds him in possession of the doll. Liza cleans off \"Brahms\".",
        "Liza and Jude take a walk around the property at Jude's request. They meet Joseph and his dog. Tensions fray when Sean urges Liza to talk about the events of the burglary, and she will not. Liza and Sean overhear Jude talking in his room. They ask if he is talking to Brahms and Jude writes 'yes' in his notepad. Weird events occur around the house, and Sean and Liza discuss a change in Jude's behavior with their therapist.",
        "Joseph talks to Jude about his dog being missing, but no one appears to have seen the dog. Liza finds disturbing pictures, and assumes they have been drawn by Jude. The family has dinner and Jude writes in his notepad that Brahms' plate is missing. Liza says that Brahms does not eat because he is a doll. She and Sean argue in the kitchen and Sean leaves the room. She goes to sit with Jude at the table and tells him that he needs to stay at the table until he eats. He writes on his notepad that she is making Brahms mad. She leaves the dining room and hears a loud noise. She and Sean run into the room. Jude writes that he told Liza not to make Brahms mad. Sean and Liza disagree about the mysterious things that are happening.",
        "Jude leaves for the nearby mansion with Brahms in hand. Joseph finds Sean and Liza in the mansion and tells them briefly about a family that had lived there prior. He says that a boy named Brahms had lived there.",
        "Sean's brother and his family come to visit. Will gets mysteriously injured during the visit. Liza becomes even more upset, and later hits Joseph on the head, then begs to know where Jude is. Joseph tells her that it will be over soon and that \"Brahms and Jude are gonna be one.\" She goes to look for Jude in the mansion.",
        "Sean finds Liza and Jude in the basement and hits Brahms with a croquet mallet. Joseph then starts to get scared and says that \"It will never be over\" and that Brahms will take out the family's failure to \"follow the rules\" on him. A furnace then explodes. Jude grabs Brahms, and throws him into the fire.",
        "Liza and Jude are soon back at their home in the city, and everything seems normal. Jude walks over to his dresser and puts on a porcelain mask. He wishes Brahms a good night, and says that everything will be fine if his family follows the rules."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 1 out of 5 stars from viewers they polled, with 24% of people saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Benjamin Lee, writing for The Guardian, gave the film one star out of five, describing it as \"so punishingly dull to watch, filled with dry, perfunctory dialogue from Stacey Menear's consistently uninventive script and shot without even a glimmer of style,\" adding that \"even at a brisk 86 minutes, it feels like unending torture...\" with a finale \"that buckles under the weight of its own stupidity, as well as some god-awful CGI.\"",
        "Katie Holmes was nominated at the Golden Raspberry Awards as Worst Actress (for her appearance in  this movie and also in The Secret: Dare to Dream)."
