        "In December 2018, Ryan King's screenplay Black Flies, based on the 2008 novel of the same name by Shannon Burke, was featured on the Black List, an annual survey of the most-liked yet unproduced scripts of the year. By February 2019, Jean-St\u00e9phane Sauvaire came on board to direct, with Mel Gibson and Tye Sheridan in final negotiations to star. In February 2021, Sean Penn replaced Gibson in one of the lead roles and was reported that Open Road Films had acquired the U.S. distribution rights. Katherine Waterston, Michael Pitt, Mike Tyson, and Raquel Nave were announced to star in the following months. Filming began in May 2022 in New York City with cinematographer David Ungaro. It was produced by Sculptor Media, FilmNation Entertainment and Projected Picture Works."

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 41% of 44 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Asphalt City can be commended for trying to highlight the unforgiving nature of EMT work, but the unrelentingly grim end results prove a punishing watch.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.",
        "Eric Ortiz Garcia of Screen Anarchy wrote that the film \"finds its power reflecting the brutal level of stress inherent in this profession... Sauvaire makes his mission explicit: to raise awareness about those paramedics who are completely overwhelmed. That's something the filmmaker achieves.\" Tori Brazier of Metro wrote, \"Black Flies is a grim tale, and not a recommended watch for the more delicate cinema fan, but its message and lack of subtlety certainly hit home.\"",
        "Pete Hammond of Deadline wrote that the film had a \"game cast and nice mostly handheld camera work by David Ungaro\" but that it failed to offer anything new, and repeated plot points already covered in Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead (1999). The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw concurred, writing that the \"sub-Schraderesque\" film was \"trading on old ideas\", and criticized its lack of female paramedic representation. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote, \"Black Flies is such an unrelentingly bleak look inside the busted gut of the American healthcare system that its posturing honesty soon curdles into something that's hard to believe.\""
