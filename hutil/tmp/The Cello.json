        "The Cello is based on Turki Al Alshikh's novel of the same name, who also wrote the script. Darren Lynn Bousman was hired to direct with Lee Nelson producing.  Principal photography completed in October 2021 after more than 100 days of filming in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Vienna, Prague, and Iceland.",
        "In February 2023, as the film entered post-production, Bousman told horror news website Bloody Disgusting, \"This movie has been a beast. We finally finished it a few weeks back and are currently in the middle of a deal for its release. So, hopefully, an announcement soon! Since the movie was shot primarily in Arabic, mixing it, doing the ADR, and then having to translate it has taken longer than we were expecting. Our hope is the movie will be released later this year\"."
