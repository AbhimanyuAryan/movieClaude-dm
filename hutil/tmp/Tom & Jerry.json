    "Plot": [
        "A cat named Tom, who dreams of being a jazz pianist, moves to New York and buskes in Central Park, while a mouse named Jerry is in search of a new home. After Tom's piano is destroyed in an altercation, he chases Jerry, but accidentally tackles a young woman named Kayla Forester, causing her to lose her job. Down on her luck, Kayla wants to prove her talents and looks for a position at the city's fanciest hotel, the Royal Gate, where Jerry moves in and Tom fails to break in. Kayla, with a stolen resume, is hired to help plan a high-profile wedding and gets a tour of the hotel, while Jerry's usual antics involve stealing food and items to ramp up his new home, and Tom plans more strategies to enter the hotel and capture Jerry.",
        "Local celebrities Preeta Mehta and her fianc\u00e9 Ben are greeted, as they arrive, along with their pet dog Spike and cat Toots. All, except for Spike, are unaware of Jerry stealing from Preeta's handbag. As the couple and their pets are escorted to their room, Jerry's presence is revealed, which puts the wedding and the hotel at risk. Kayla offers to catch Jerry, but fails and realizes that he will be hard to catch. After many failed attempts, Tom successfully enters the hotel, and his ensuing chase after Jerry wrecks a hotel room. Due to noise complaints, Kayla comes to check and befriends Tom, due to their shared goal of catching Jerry. The hotel's owner and general manager Mr. Dubros hires Tom to exterminate Jerry, while Tom and Kayla's boss Terence threatens to fire them if Tom cannot catch Jerry.",
        "After more failed attempts, Tom designs an elaborate mouse trap that gets Jerry out of the hotel. Meanwhile, Kayla helps with the wedding plans and learns that Preeta's engagement ring is missing. Jerry returns, to clash with Tom on the piano, and reveals to Kayla that he had Preeta's ring and agrees to give it back to her in exchange for letting him live in the hotel. Before Kayla can agree, Terence returns from walking Spike and notices Tom looking for Jerry hiding in Kayla's coat pocket, creating a scene that causes Spike, Tom, and Jerry's chase to destroy the lobby. Terence is suspended, while Kayla is promoted to event manager, for returning Preeta's ring. Kayla tells Tom and Jerry that they will have to get along and spend the next day bonding if they want to stay in the hotel, to which they reluctantly agree.",
        "While Kayla takes care of the hotel and manages the wedding with the crew, Tom and Jerry explore the city, but are imprisoned at a pound, after inadvertently committing fan interference on a baseball game. A vengeful Terence separately visits Tom and Jerry and feeds them lies about what they said about each other behind their backs, inciting them to a battle at the ceremony that throws the wedding into carnage and destroys the rest of the hotel. After Kayla comes clean and leaves in disgrace, Terence evicts Tom, and Preeta renounces the wedding. Realizing that it is their fault, Tom and Jerry put their differences aside, and convince Kayla and the hotel crew, including a skeptical Terence, to salvage the wedding. The pair lure Preeta and Toots to Central Park, where the wedding is held.",
        "Kayla promises to Preeta that Tom and Jerry have atoned for their behavior, and Ben apologizes to Preeta for his extensive expenses, in light of impressing her father. Kayla and the stolen resume's owner reconcile with each other and get jobs at the hotel, while Tom finally becomes a jazz pianist and plays the piano for Toots, with Jerry joining the party until a mishap causes them to fight again. In a post-credit scene, Ben receives a bill for both weddings."

    "Production": [
        "On January 22, 2009, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans for a new Tom and Jerry theatrical film, as a live-action/CGI hybrid film produced by Dan Lin with a script written by Eric Gravning, following the success of Alvin and the Chipmunks. It would have followed Tom and Jerry's origins over a Chicago backdrop, where they reluctantly work together to get back home.",
        "On April 6, 2015, plans shifted to a CGI-animated film produced by Warner Animation Group, with a script written by Bryan Schulz and Cornelius Uliano, who co-wrote The Peanuts Movie with Craig Schulz. It was about a young family who moves into a New England country house inhabited by Jerry and adopts Tom to get rid of him. The duo would team up to protect the family and their house from an outside threat, and learn the meaning of family and friendship. Cate Adams and Jesse Ehrman, who remains an executive producer on the final film, were set to oversee it. Tom and Jerry: Cowboy Up! recycled parts of the script.",
        "On October 15, 2018, Warner Animation Group hired Tim Story to direct a Tom and Jerry film set as \"an eye-popping blend of classic animation and live-action\", inspired by Who Framed Roger Rabbit's technique. It would begin filming in 2019, with a script written by Kevin Costello that was pitched in 2017 and purely influenced from the original cartoons. When in discussions with Warner Bros. executives about what he was interested in directing next, Story \"immediately mentioned his admiration for the characters and how he'd love tackling that property\", after they brought the film as an option. Story memorized the original cartoons growing up, and claimed that it was his dream project to direct a Tom and Jerry film. While Costello's idea was to place the cat and mouse in a fancy New York hotel set to plan an Indian wedding, as \"a much bigger canvas\" for the duo and their antics than their usual average-sized house. The fancy hotel backdrop and the setting in New York City, where some of the old shorts were set, also gave the creative team more opportunities to expand Tom and Jerry's world and shenanigans. That, and the expanded opportunities for the animators to animate more animals in the classic Tom and Jerry style and animation, were also why the Indian wedding was in the script. Director Tim Story, producer Chris DeFaria, and writer Kevin Costello all agreed to use the old shorts, even pictures of them taped in the production office, as reference material for the film, which the studio gave them access to. In addition to the original Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the film pays tribute to silent cinema. During production, Story also ran through the classic shorts from memory, re-visited the franchise's history, and re-watched some Charlie Chaplin, for more inspiration in the film's humor and storytelling with silent characters. Story was against the idea of making Tom and Jerry fluently talk, because they only sparingly spoke in the original cartoons and that their charm comes from their non-verbal behavior, activities and interactions. Story compared Tom and Jerry's relationship to a sibling rivalry, where despite their mayhem and hatred for each other, they would sometimes need each other and put their differences aside to save the day, which adapts that core theme from the cartoons into the movie. He hoped the film will appeal to longtime fans and a new generation of audiences, and quotes \"Fingers crossed, if they [William Hanna and Joseph Barbera] are looking from above, they'll be proud of what we made\". Warner Bros. played a part in supervising the film, ensuring it stays as true to the source material's original roots as possible, which includes ensuring it does not tone down the cartoon violence.",
        "In March 2019, it was reported that Zoey Deutch and Olivia Cooke were frontrunners for the lead live-action role of Kayla, \"who teams up with Tom to stop the pesky Jerry from ruining an important event for herself\". Additionally, Jennifer Lawrence, Camila Cabello,  Yara Shahidi, Kelly Marie Tran, Becky G and Isabela Moner were all in consideration for the role. In April, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz was in final negotiations to star in the film. Moretz described Kayla as \"a lot like Jerry\" and as \"a girl who gunned for what she wanted to achieve but realizes that time and honesty is what will prevail in the end\", as well as \"a total goofball\", the latter aspect which allowed Moretz to \"lean into who [she is] in real life\". She said Kayla is \"a little unlikeable with some of the decisions she makes\", yet she still wanted the character to feel likeable. Moretz was inspired in her performance by Bob Hoskins' performance as Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, as well as by actresses Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Aniston, Lucille Ball, and Meg Ryan. Moretz, an avid fan of the source material, says the film \"really does harken back to the Tom and Jerry we love\". When she was first given the script, she was openly anxious about the film and worried that a more modern take on the characters would not work. She ended up being proud of the film's faithfulness to the material and characters, and felt it is a great way to introduce them to a new generation of audiences.",
        "Later that month, in March 2019, it was reported that Peter Dinklage was considered for the role of Terrance, Kayla's boss and the human antagonist of the film. In May 2019, Michael Pe\u00f1a joined the cast in the role Dinklage was eyed for. Colin Jost, Ken Jeong, Rob Delaney, Jordan Bolger and Pallavi Sharda were added to the cast in July. Patsy Ferran was revealed to be part of the cast in September 2019. Besides Moretz, Pe\u00f1a, Jost, Jeong, Delaney, Bolger, Sharda and Ferran have all grown up with Tom and Jerry, and were thrilled to take their roles. According to director Tim Story, \"Everybody knew exactly what this movie is about. Everybody knew those characters. Everybody was starting with a shared knowledge of these characters and kind of got what the movie should be\".",
        "In November 2020, Nicky Jam and Lil Rel Howery revealed that they have been cast in the film in voice roles. On December 2, 2020, Jam revealed that he will be the voice of Butch Cat in the film.",
        "Principal photography began in July 2019 at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Hertfordshire, England. The film was shot by cinematographer Alan Stewart, on the Sony VENICE cinema cameras and Panavision Primo 70 and Primo Artiste Lenses. Animators were present during filming, allowing cast members to improvise, while puppeteers handled figures of the animated characters that were designed to match their exact size, which helped the filmmakers with framing and helped the animators with lighting and other cues. This resulted in a seamless integration of animation and live-action. Filming ended in September 2019, before the industry's temporary shutdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "For the film's production design, production designer James Hambidge went for a color palette that would avoid causing the animated characters' colors to clash with it. Hambidge, director Tim Story, and cinematographer Alan Stewart also ensured the film looks \"bright, poppy and upbeat\" yet colorful and realistic, \"in keeping with the original cartoons\", and avoided making it look drab and dark. Story also avoided putting the characters in the human world. He acknowledges that Tom and Jerry were set in a realistic yet colorful universe, where their cartoony rules co-exist with humans who also have their own set of rules to live by, and aimed to bring their world to life. Who Framed Roger Rabbit was also acknowledged as inspiration for the film's live-action worldbuilding interaction with cartoon characters. When shooting the film, Stewart also took inspiration from the 1945 short \u201cMouse in Manhattan\u201d, to recreate how it was more realistically-shot than the usual Tom and Jerry cartoon (which Story knows were usually shot in a rather flat, profile way), for the film's setting in Manhattan.",
        "Both visual effects and animation services were provided by Framestore, who took inspiration from the original cartoons' world and animation, and films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Mary Poppins, for the movie's blend of classic animation and live-action. Framestore hired approximately 120 animators with experience in 2D animation, to animate the characters. Despite being 3D models, the animators aimed to maintain \"the look and spirit of the 2D cartoons from the \u201940s and \u201950s\".  This technique is often confused with cel shading, an animation technique that renders a cartoon-like aesthetic to computer graphics, but it's actually a new form of animation that director Tim Story referred as \"2D-plus animation\". Story mentioned that keeping their classic 2D look and feel into the art direction and character animation for the film respected their beloved cartoon state, and emphasized how \"people would have a real nostalgia experience with the film\", by doing so. Producer Chris DeFaria mentioned that \"Tom and Jerry are really cute; their designs were really an achievement in animation. The purity of form, how expressive they can be\", and wanted the film to honor the shorts.",
        "To maintain the original '1940s-\u20191950s Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts' 2D-animated character designs, art style, movements, and expressions, the 3D animators created classic 2D tools for their weight, rendering, shading, outlines, line of action, smear frames, inbetweening, onion skinning, motion blur, and squash and stretch. The team also used the classic shorts and many reference images from the production office, to help further. Animation director Michael Eames looked back on the original Tom and Jerry shorts' classic 2D art style and animation. Eames also hired 2D sketch viz artists, to design classic poses and expressions of the characters in 2D, as a guide for the 3D animators. This helped the animators incorporate the classic 2D art style and animation from the original Tom and Jerry cartoons into the film, and it helped them refine and sculpt the 2D character shapes and details that they could not achieve in the animation process. Animation work was done remotely during the pandemic, with the filmmakers doing creative exploration on certain shots, and finalizing material through production groups. Additional animation work was done to some backgrounds, like shading the vibrant sky with 2D animation and saturating the colors. The film's cast, such as Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, also applauded the creative decision to keep the characters as close to their classic 2D finish as possible without adapting them \"into computer-generated modern characters, because that's not who they are.\"",
        "On July 22, 2020, it was announced that Tim Story's recurring collaborator and music composer Christopher Lennertz will compose the film's score. The album was released by WaterTower Music on February 12, having 30 tracks. The soundtrack also has some songs made for the film by various artists, including Allen \"BizKit\" Arthur's song \"Showoff\" in his jazz saxophonist roots. Wanting to capture the feel of the original cartoons' orchestral music (and usual use of jazz music), Story and Lennertz revisited them as reference and inspiration, for the film's music, but added some more genres (such as Indian music and some hip-hop which was largely jazz-based) into the mix, to be inclusive to more cultures in every generation possible. An exclusive Tom and Jerry theme tune also played in the movie's end credits, \nwhile a short version of it is also available on the soundtrack. More music inspiration from the original cartoons involves the film's portrayal of Tom as a jazz pianist, such as Tom playing jazz pianist Eric Reed's piece \"Soft Shoe\", when busking in Central Park. The movie also has a scene where Tom sings the Ray Charles song \"Don't You Know?\" to impress Toots, which Story confirms was \"consistent with the \u201940s and \u201950s cartoons.\"",
        "For the film's sound design, Story was able to get the rights to archive many sound effects from the MGM Cartoon library, such as William Hanna's high-pitched screams for Tom, Jerry's musical laughs, and the impacts of the characters being hit, which were edited by Peter S. Elliot (another recurring collaborator of Tim Story) to sound beefier. Wanting to stay as faithful to the original Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts as possible, Story promised that \"audiences will hear the sound effects they're used to, as Tom and Jerry chase after each other and destroy everything in their path.\""

    "Reception": [
        "Tom & Jerry grossed $46.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $90 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $136.5 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $4 million from 2,479 theaters on its first day of release. It went on to debut to $14.1 million, the second-best opening weekend of the pandemic behind Warner Bros.'s December release Wonder Woman 1984 ($16.7 million). The opening weekend audiences were 51% female and 46% under the age of 17, while 35% was Hispanic, 33% Caucasian, 21% African American, and 11% Asian. David Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, said of the figure: \"With half of theaters still closed, the pandemic still a threat, and Tom & Jerry available at home, this is a very good opening.\" In its second weekend the film grossed $6.6 million and in its third made $4 million, finishing second behind newcomer Raya and the Last Dragon both times.",
        "The film was initially released in seven international markets, grossing $1.45 million; Singapore led with $457,000. By its second weekend of international release the film was playing in 16 markets, including debuting at number one in Brazil ($746,000) and Mexico ($395,000).",
        "Several publications reported that Tom & Jerry received mostly negative reviews, upon release. According to Screen Rant writer Adam Bentz, early reviews for the film reportedly noted its entertainment value for families and nostalgic appeal for adult audiences, but criticized the script for its human cast and lack of ambition. The hybrid live-action/animation style got mixed reactions. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"It isn't the worst of the long-squabbling duo's feature-length adventures, but Tom & Jerry is disappointingly short on the anarchic spirit of their classic shorts.\" On Metacritic, the film a has weighted average score of 32 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 79% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 60% saying they would recommend it.",
        "The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore said that audiences should just \"rewatch Roger Rabbit instead\" and wrote: \"Tim Story's Tom & Jerry is five to ten minutes of action that might have worked in one of the cartoon duo's shorts, surrounded by an inordinate amount of unimaginative, unfunny human-based conflict.\" Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film a score of 1 out of 5 stars, writing: \"nothing will prepare you for the tone-deaf nature of this live-action abomination that inserts our cartoon protagonists, Who Framed Roger Rabbit-style, into a crass Manhattan misadventure about a celebrity wedding gone awry.\" Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent gave the film a score of 1 out of 5 stars, describing it as \"the cinematic equivalent of a sausage casing stuffed with mystery meat\", though she praised Moretz's performance. Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film a score of 2 out of 5 stars, writing: \"While there's little to truly loathe in Fantastic Four and Ride Along director Tim Story's frantic new take on Tom & Jerry, there's also an equal lack of anything to truly love; this is a serviceable, if entirely forgettable attempt to relaunch an old property for a new audience.\"",
        "Tom & Jerry received some positive reviews, among other critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the film a score of 6/10, and wrote: \"Tom & Jerry is a sufficient family offering with a cool cast, a sparkling soundtrack, and occasional fun. It's too bad that Tom and Jerry often feel like afterthoughts in their own film and that there wasn't much more for them to do other than serve the story of others.\" Charlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard gave the film a score of 3 out of 5 stars, and wrote: \"Ignore catty reviews that present this caper as soulless. Though horribly flawed, its internal organs are in the right place.\"  Matthew Bond of Daily Mail gave the film a score of 3 out of 5 stars, writing \"they\u2019ve retained their mute, indestructible, 2-D animated personas and the end result is much funnier than expected.\" Brooke Price at The Banner, who also mentions the film's production as a reference, praised the film and found it entertaining, nostalgic, beautifully-animated and blended with live-action, and faithful to the source material. Peter Debruge of Variety was also positive on the film and said: \"Truth be told, the movie's a pretty faithful extension of the frenemies' long-running feud \u2014 basically, the two cannot peacefully coexist under the same roof \u2014 and as such, we should be grateful to director Tim Story (Shaft) and screenwriter Kevin Costello (Brigsby Bear) for not dropping a two-ton anvil on our nostalgia, the way so many big-studio toonsploitation projects have in recent years.\"",
        "The movie was also nominated for the \"Best VFX in Feature Film\" award, at the 2021 Australian Effects & Animation Festival."
