It is directed by Phyllis Nagy. The screenplay was written by Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi.\nIt premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2022.[3] It was released in the United States on October 28, 2022, by Roadside Attractions.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nJoy, a traditional housewife in the United States in the 1960s, learns that she is pregnant with a second child but that the pregnancy threatens her life. After her hospital\u2019s all-male board denies her request for an abortion, she becomes involved with the Jane Collective, a Chicago underground women's network that took risks to help women secure safe, illegal abortions, beginning in the late 1960s and stopping only in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision.[2][4]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nElizabeth Banks as Joy\nSigourney Weaver as Virginia\nChris Messina as Will\nKate Mara as Lana\nWunmi Mosaku as Gwen\nCory Michael Smith as Dean\nGrace Edwards as Charlotte\nJohn Magaro[5] as Detective Chilmark\nAida Turturro as Sister Mike\nBianca D'Ambrosio as Erin\nBruce MacVittie as Director Richardson\nRebecca Henderson[5] as Edie\nMaia Scalia as Marion\nSean King as Officer White\nAlison Jaye as Sandra\nKristina Harrison as Clare\nProduction[edit]\nThe script originally appeared on the 2017 Black List, where it received seven votes. Coincidentally, another script based on the same story, titled This is Jane by Daniel Loflin, was also featured on the same Black List, with nine votes.\nIt was announced in October 2020 that Elizabeth Banks, Sigourney Weaver, Kate Mara and Rupert Friend had been cast to star in the film. Elisabeth Moss and Susan Sarandon had been initially cast as Joy and Virginia respectively,[6] but both had to exit due to scheduling conflicts.[7]  In May 2021, Chris Messina, Cory Michael Smith, Aida Turturro, Wunmi Mosaku, Grace Edwards, and Bianca D'Ambrosio joined the cast of the film, with Friend no longer attached.[8][9][10][11]\nThe film was shot in West Hartford, Connecticut from May and June 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[12][13]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2022.[14] On February 4, 2022, Roadside Attractions acquired the film's distribution rights, with plans to release it theatrically in the fall.[15] It was released on October 28, 2022.[16]\nThe film was released for VOD on December 6, 2022, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on December 13, 2022.[17]\nThe film partnered with Planned Parenthood and the Abortion Care Network to screen at dozens of American clinics. In a statement by Nagy, the director hoped that screenings would serve as an opportunity to increase awareness around direct abortion care services in the months following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.[18]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 130 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Although its focus is somewhat narrow, Call Jane is an entertaining and dramatically effective dramatization of a pivotal chapter in American history.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[20]\nOn its opening weekend, Call Jane grossed $243,922.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Call Jane (2022)\".
