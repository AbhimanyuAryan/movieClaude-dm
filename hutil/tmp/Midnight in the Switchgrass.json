    "Reception": [
        "On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 8% approval rating, based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 3.40/10. The website's critics consensus read,: \"Dull and predictable, Midnight in the Switchgrass squanders an evocative setting and some committed performances on a would-be thriller that rarely raises a sweat.\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 24 out of 100, based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".",
        "Robert Kojder of Flickering Myth said that \"the fact that Midnight in the Switchgrass is an all-around terrible movie comes as no surprise, but there is a sting since for star Megan Fox, it's coming off a career-best and physically impressive performance in Till Death.\" Jackie K. Cooper rated the film 5 out of 10 saying that \"Megan Fox steals the show while Bruce Willis is missing in action.\"",
        "In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg said that \"the atmosphere is thoroughly sleazy without being distinctive, and everything about the movie - the emotionless line readings, the half-baked back stories - exudes a terse functionality.\"",
        "Waldemar Dalenogare Neto rated the film 2 out of 10 and stated that it is one of the \"most generic thrillers of the year (...) I really don't know yet what the purpose of this film is other than the fact that it tries to profit from Megan Fox's image and Bruce Willis.\" In a positive review for the San Jose Mercury News, Randy Myers said that \"it's worth a watch if you like serial killer thrillers but don't expect to see anything revolutionary going on.\"",
        "Jesse Hassenger was less complimentary in his review for Paste Magazine by saying that it looks like the filmmakers are trying to punish Megan Fox for her performance in Till Death, and he concluded, \"It's entirely because of Fox that Switchgrass stays compelling far longer than it should, raising vain hopes that she'll be able to work it into something pulpier and more defined. Despite the eventual disappointment, I hope she sticks with genre fare a bit longer, and finds some more shackles to break.\""
