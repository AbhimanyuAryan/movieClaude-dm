    "Production": [
        "In 2017, Jamila Wignot was approached by Insignia Films to direct a documentary about Alvin Ailey after discovering American Masters had not produced a documentary film revolving around his life, and that no film biographies about Ailey existed. Production on the film began in Summer 2018, and concluded in October 2019. Wingot also incorporated audio recordings made by Ailey, for an autobiography he was collaborating on with A. Peter Bailey, feeling it was important to have the story told from his voice.",
        "Wignot wanted to include apart from Ailey's life and career, a contemporary element to the film by filming rehearsals of Lazarus by the Alvin Ailey Dance Company to show Ailey's impact and leverage for the next generation of artists."

The critics consensus reads \"Ailey pays invigorating tribute to its subject's brilliant legacy -- and offers a tantalizing introduction to the rest of a fascinating story.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 77 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".",
        "Jonita Davis of The Black Cape said the film \"works to chronicle the rise off a legend while also documenting the hardships of performing in the US from the 1950s onward.\" Gia Kourlas of The New York Times gave the film a positive review writing: \"Wignot layers images, video and - most important - voice-overs from Ailey to create a portrait that feels as poetic and nuanced as choreography itself.\""
