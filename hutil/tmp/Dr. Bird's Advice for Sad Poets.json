        "Cyntia Vinney of Comic Book Resources gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"None of this would land, however, if it weren\u2019t for Zumann\u2019s earnest, heartfelt performance. He perfectly balances James' anxiety with his underlying sweetness as well as his awkward idiosyncrasy.\"",
        "Glenn Kenny of The New York Times gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"The movie gets so drunk on its stylistic affectations (and unfunny attempts at cerebral comedy) that by the time it sobers up to take James's mental health seriously, it's too little, too late.\""
