    "Plot": [
        "Matt Turner works as a financier at Nanite Capital under his friend and CEO Anders Muller and lives with his wife, Heather, and two children, Emily and Zach, in Berlin. While driving his kids to school, Matt receives a call from an unknown number with a distorted voice who says that there is a bomb under his seat, which was already armed when Matt sat on it. The bomb is triggered by both pressure plates placed on all the seats and a radio frequency. He also threatens to detonate the bomb if Matt tries to get help. Matt finds the device and he is forced to follow the bomber\u2019s instructions in order to keep them alive.",
        "The bomber forces Matt to watch Sylvain, the latter\u2019s client who is also receiving a bomb threat, being killed in an explosion when Sylvain\u2019s panicked girlfriend attempts to escape. The bomber tells Matt to call Heather to retrieve \u20ac50,000 from his safety deposit box at the bank and deliver it to him. After Heather retrieves it, the bomber changes the plan by telling her to give the money to a man in a blue suit. When she does, the police arrive and arrest the man.",
        "After seeing the news implicating Matt for the bombing, Europol agent Angela Brickmann calls him; Matt tries to convince her of his innocence and requests that cellular signals be jammed to prevent the remote trigger. The bomber reveals that Matt and Anders have a \u20ac208 million slush fund from the clients deposited in Matt\u2019s \u201cemergency collateral account\u201d in a bank in Dubai. He arranges for Matt to meet Anders at a power plant. Arriving there, the bomber forces Matt to order Anders to liquidate his collateral account. Despite Anders reluctantly complying, the bomber orders Matt to kill Anders with a revolver in exchange for his life and his children. When Matt refuses, the bomber blows up Anders\u2019s car; the shrapnel injures Emily\u2019s leg.",
        "After a police chase, Matt is eventually surrounded by them with Angela and Heather arriving at the scene. Once they realize that the pressure plate is only located under Matt's seat, the bomb squad safely removes Zach and Emily, who is then treated for her injuries. Interrogating Matt, Angela suspects the bombing might be related to the heist. After talking to Heather for the last time, Matt drives away and evades the police, determined to find the bomber by himself. Matt demands the bomber to meet him in person if he wants the money.",
        "The bomber is revealed to be Anders all along. Anders reveals that he wanted to make Matt a fall guy for the series of bombings to cover up his scheme of embezzling \u20ac208 million wired into his crypto account. To end this, Matt deliberately crashes his car, causing it to cling on the side of a bridge. Matt unlocks his seat belt and falls into the river, allowing the bomb to activate and kill Anders. Angela and the police arrive at the scene, with Angela nodding at Matt before allowing him to walk free.",
        "During the credits, the news reports state that the bombings were part of the heist perpetrated by Anders, and Matt cooperates with Europol to resolve the incident."

    "Reception": [
        "Retribution has grossed $6.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $11.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.7 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, Retribution was released alongside Gran Turismo, The Hill, and Golda, and was projected to gross $2\u20133 million from 1,750 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $1.3 million on its first day, and went on to debut to $3.3 million, finishing eighth.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 28% of 92 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Retribution may prove mildly diverting for hardcore fans of films depicting Liam Neeson as a parent in peril, but in most respects, this thriller is strictly standard stuff.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 54% overall positive score.",
        "In a mixed review for Vulture, Bilge Ebiri stated that \"Neeson\u2019s action movies often turn on his characters\u2019 anxieties as a father and/or husband \u2014 sublimating his own tragic personal history into the realm of fictional motivation.\" and that, \"Most of Retribution consists of three shots: a close-up of Matt, a close-up of his daughter, and a close-up of his son. But out of these simple building blocks and this nothing script, Antal extracts plenty of suspense and even emotion\".",
        "Noel Murray, in the Los Angeles Times, found \"The script is too flatly functional, weighed down by periodic info dumps where various people try to explain how Matt\u2019s floundering business might connect to his current predicament.\", adding that \"Liam Neeson has done so many variations on the \u201cangry dad\u201d action hero that we can start dividing those movies into sub-genres.\" and that \"While Retribution is far from Neeson\u2019s best, it still mostly works, so long as you tune out the dialogue and focus on the hero\u2019s twitchy face, waiting to see which will blow to smithereens first: his car or his patience\"."
