A family friend gives Caitlin two pigeons, and in studying the details of pigeon care and racing, Caitlin learns that a pigeon breeder with a valuable racing pigeon lives nearby. Caitlin and her best friend steal the pigeon and sell it to the Russian Pigeon Mafia, but the rightful owner finds her school bag on his roof, and so is able to track her down. Rather than turning her in to the police, the breeder decides to work with Caitlin to recover the pigeon."

        "Adrian Horton of The Guardian awarded the film a score of two out of five, writing \"Little Wing is overall an odd, unaffecting mess, other than, again, the pigeons, who look majestic on camera. Besides an overly serious Cox, there's little to distinguish it from the many throwaway titles unceremoniously released on streaming services\"."
