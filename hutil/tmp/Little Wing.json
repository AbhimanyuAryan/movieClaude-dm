It stars Brooklynn Prince, Che Tafari, Kelly Reilly, and Brian Cox. It is based on the 2006 New Yorker magazine article of the same name by Susan Orlean.\nLittle Wing was released by Paramount+ on March 13, 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTeenager Caitlin's parents have divorced. Her mother is readying to sell the family home. A family friend gives Caitlin two pigeons, and in studying the details of pigeon care and racing, Caitlin learns that a pigeon breeder with a valuable racing pigeon lives nearby. Caitlin and her best friend steal the pigeon and sell it to the Russian Pigeon Mafia, but the rightful owner finds her school bag on his roof, and so is able to track her down. Rather than turning her in to the police, the breeder decides to work with Caitlin to recover the pigeon.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBrooklynn Prince as Kaitlyn McKay\nChe Tafari as Adam King\nBrian Cox as Jaan Vari\nKelly Reilly as Maddie McKay\nSimon Khan as Matt McKay\nTrinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tessa Lu\nMelanie Nicholls-King as Ms. Gibbons\nJeanine Jackson as Pat Litch\nLowell Deo as Ben Lasher\nJonathan Togo as Sean McKay\nProduction[edit]\nIn April 2023, it was announced that a coming-of-age drama film directed by Dean Israelite and written by John Gatins was in production for Awesomeness Films and Paramount+. It is based on the magazine article of the same name by Susan Orlean, who also served as an executive producer. The original article follows Sedona Murphy, a 13-year old-girl who raised homing pigeons in her South Boston backyard.[1]\nPrincipal photography occurred in April 2023 in Portland, Oregon.[2] Some scenes were shot along the Hawthorne Bridge.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nLittle Wing was released by Paramount+ on March 13, 2024.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 9 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10.[5]\nAdrian Horton of The Guardian awarded the film a score of two out of five, writing \"Little Wing is overall an odd, unaffecting mess, other than, again, the pigeons, who look majestic on camera. Besides an overly serious Cox, there's little to distinguish it from the many throwaway titles unceremoniously released on streaming services\".[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Grobar, Matt (April 19, 2023). \"Bleecker Street Acquires U.S. Rights To Casey Affleck & Laurence Fishburne Starrer Slingshot\".
