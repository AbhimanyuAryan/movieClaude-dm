Jones. It stars Rose Reid, Jedidiah Goodacre and Katherine McNamara. It was released theatrically in the United States by Roadside Attractions on May 14, 2021.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAfter an ill-fated audition at a prestigious New York music school, Finley Sinclair follows in her late brother Alex's footsteps and takes a up a student exchange program he once took, travelling to a coastal village in Ireland to begin a semester studying abroad. There she meets heartthrob movie star Beckett Rush, who is shooting the latest installment of his medieval fantasy-adventure franchise. They begin an unlikely romance, but when forces surrounding Beckett's stardom threaten to crush their dreams, Finley must decide what she will risk for love.[3][4]\n\nCast[edit]\nRose Reid as Finley Sinclair\nJedidiah Goodacre as Beckett Rush\nKatherine McNamara as Taylor Risdale\nPatrick Bergin as Seamus\nSaoirse-Monica Jackson as Emma Callaghan\nJudith Hoag as Jennifer Sinclair\nTom Everett Scott as Montgomery Rush\nVanessa Redgrave as Cathleen Sweeney\nNatalie Britton as Gemma Quinlan\nFiona Bell as Nora\nMarion O'Dwyer as Molly\nAnabel Sweeney as Keeva\nHelen Roche as Fiona Doyle\nProduction[edit]\nFilming was in Ireland, in and around Dublin, Clare, Offaly, Kildare, Cooley and Carlingford, County Louth; and also in New York City, Los Angeles and Nashville.[5] In September 2020, it was announced that Roadside Attractions had acquired the film's US theatrical distribution rights from Red Sky Studios, Nook Lane Entertainment and MK1 Studios.[3] The film's initial title, There You'll Find Me, was renamed to Finding You.\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on May 14, 2021,[6] by Roadside Attractions.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nFinding You was projected to gross $532,000-$1 million in its opening weekend.[7] It made $323,000 from 1,314 theaters on its first day, and $954,000 over its opening weekend.[8]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nAccording to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 53% of 38 critics reviewed the film positively, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Although Finding You manages to fit every contrivance possible into its story, its charming fluff and sharp humor may be enough to win the hearts of romance fans.\"[9] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 41 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[10] Audiences surveyed by PostTrak gave the film a 71% positive score, with 46% saying they would definitely recommend it.[8]\nGiving the film 2.5/4 stars, Michael O'Sullivan positively reviewed the film for the Washington Post, writing that although it contained \"no real surprises... Finding You kinda, sorta [works].\"[11] Plugged In reviewer Paul Asay opined that while the story is \"fairly predictable\", it illustrated well \"that sex and romance aren't synonymous; that kindness matters; and that even in moments of disappointment, God may be operating behind the scenes.\"[12] Tara McNamara of Common Sense Media also commented on the film's religious themes, writing that \"the movie's faith-based elements has a mic-drop moment, but it happens without a single line of dialogue and isn't jarring or forced.\" McNamara gave the film 3/5 stars, praising the well-assembled cast and the setting in the Irish countryside, noting that the film was more a coming-of-age story than a romance.[13]\nIn a mixed review for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Ordo\u00f1a praised many of the cast members but criticized the film's determination \"to be PG-clean\" and Finley's character, saying she lacked personality.[14] Giving the film a grade of \"C\", Adam Graham of the Detroit News opined that the film was heavily clich\u00e9d and lacked anything of substance \"except for the exquisite greenery of Ireland.\"[15] Kate Erbland of Indie Wire gave it a \"C\u2212\" grade, deriding it for its predictability, but noting that it contained \"brief moments of magic\":\n\nFinley and Beckett\u2019s frequent field trips afford them time to charm each other against lush Irish backdrops, Beckett\u2019s troubles with fame shine an unexpectedly prescient light on the movie-making world, and Finley\u2019s bond with crotchety Mrs. Sweeney (Redgrave) is both amusing and heartfelt. But even those flashes of sweetness and smartness are stuck in between increasingly odd twists and tropes, eager to play up the \u201cNotting Hill\u201d of it all without actually doing the work to make it stick.[16]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Finding You (2021) - Financial Information\".
