        "According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 53% of 38 critics reviewed the film positively, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Although Finding You manages to fit every contrivance possible into its story, its charming fluff and sharp humor may be enough to win the hearts of romance fans.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 41 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by PostTrak gave the film a 71% positive score, with 46% saying they would definitely recommend it.",
        "Giving the film 2.5/4 stars, Michael O'Sullivan positively reviewed the film for the Washington Post, writing that although it contained \"no real surprises... Finding You kinda, sorta [works].\" Plugged In reviewer Paul Asay opined that while the story is \"fairly predictable\", it illustrated well \"that sex and romance aren't synonymous; that kindness matters; and that even in moments of disappointment, God may be operating behind the scenes.\" Tara McNamara of Common Sense Media also commented on the film's religious themes, writing that \"the movie's faith-based elements has a mic-drop moment, but it happens without a single line of dialogue and isn't jarring or forced.\" McNamara gave the film 3/5 stars, praising the well-assembled cast and the setting in the Irish countryside, noting that the film was more a coming-of-age story than a romance.",
        "In a mixed review for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Ordo\u00f1a praised many of the cast members but criticized the film's determination \"to be PG-clean\" and Finley's character, saying she lacked personality. Giving the film a grade of \"C\", Adam Graham of the Detroit News opined that the film was heavily clich\u00e9d and lacked anything of substance \"except for the exquisite greenery of Ireland.\" Kate Erbland of Indie Wire gave it a \"C\u2212\" grade, deriding it for its predictability, but noting that it contained \"brief moments of magic\":"
