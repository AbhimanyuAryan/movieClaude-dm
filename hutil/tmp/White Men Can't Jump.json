It stars Sinqua Walls and Jack Harlow, in his acting debut, in the lead roles, alongside Teyana Taylor, Laura Harrier, Vince Staples, Myles Bullock, and Lance Reddick in one of his final film performances before his death in March 2023.[2]\nWhite Men Can't Jump was released on May 19, 2023, on Hulu. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. The film has an accompanying soundtrack.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nIn this modern remix of the iconic film, seemingly opposite street hoopers, Jeremy, an injury prone former star, and Kamal, a has-been prodigy, team up to take one final shot at living out their dreams.[3]\u2014\u200aHulu\nCast[edit]\nSinqua Walls as Kamal\nJack Harlow as Jeremy\nLance Reddick as Benji\nTeyana Taylor as Imani\nLaura Harrier as Tatiana\nMyles Bullock as Renzo\nVince Staples as Speedy\nZak Steiner as Phillip Williamson\nJ. Alphonse Nicholson as Jermaine\nAiden Shute as Drew\nBentley Green as Jacoby\nAndrew Schulz as TJ\nJames Earl as Mooch\nAdditionally, Stan Verrett, Blake Griffin, Taylor Rooks and Tyler Herro play themselves.\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn January 2017, Kenya Barris was reported to be developing a White Men Can't Jump remake produced by NBA star Blake Griffin and NFL player Ryan Kalil.[4] In November 2021, Calmatic was revealed to be the director.[5] In March 2022, rapper and actor Jack Harlow was cast in the film, in the role originally played by Woody Harrelson.[6] In April 2022, Sinqua Walls was cast as Kamal Allen, the equivalent of Wesley Snipes' character in the original 1992 film.[7] Other characters include Jermaine, who often antagonizes Kamal; Bobby, Kamal's boss; and an opposing fan who trash-talks Kamal.[8] Barris produced the film under his Khalabo Ink Society banner alongside Hall, and Kalil, Griffin, and Noah Weinstein executive produce under their Mortal Media banner.[7] On May 5, 2022, Lance Reddick, Teyana Taylor, and Laura Harrier were cast in the film.[9] Additional castings included Tamera \"Tee\" Kissen, Myles Bullock, Vince Staples, and Zak Steiner.[10]\nFilming began on May 11, 2022, in Los Angeles, with Tommy Maddox-Upshaw as the cinematographer.[11] It wrapped up by July 2022.[10] The film was scored by  Marcelo Zarvos and will feature a soundtrack by DJ Drama.[12][13] By January 11, 2023, the film was in post-production.[14]\n\nRelease[edit]\nWhite Men Can't Jump was released on May 19, 2023, on Hulu.[15]\n\nReception[edit]\nAudience viewership[edit]\nAccording to Whip Media's TV Time, White Men Can't Jump was the fifth most streamed film across all platforms in the United States, during the week of May 21, 2023,[16] and the ninth during the week of May 28, 2023.[17]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 26% of 88 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Never mind being able to get air - the White Men Can't Jump remake struggles to come up with reasons for its own existence.\"[18] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 40 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[19]\nWendy Ide of The Observer gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \"It's fine. But the abrasive edges of the original have been smoothed in favour of a safer, more generic template sport movie approach.\"[20] Robert Daniels of RogerEbert.com gave it one out of four stars, calling it \"as unimaginative as it is corny, as dull as it is cheap, and as unfulfilling as any cash grab for a well-known property could be.\"[21]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nLance Reddick received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Performance in a TV Movie or Limited Series at the 2023 Black Reel Awards for Television.[22][23]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of basketball films\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"White Men Can't Jump\".
