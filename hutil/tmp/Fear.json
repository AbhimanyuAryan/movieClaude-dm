        "Matthew Monagle of The Austin Chronicle wrote, \"It is frustrating to watch Fear carelessly oscillate between creature feature, haunted house movie, and folk horror... In the end, the scariest thing about Fear is its stock video opening montage \u2013 not a compliment any director wants to hear.\" Katie Walsh of the Tribune News Service praised the cinematography, score and sound design, but criticized the script as \"prov[ing] that it is possible to have too many ideas for just one film.\" She added, \"Deadliest of all, Fear is just not scary. The jump scares don't land, the fears themselves are all a bit silly and it feels like Taylor is holding back for the majority of the run time.\" Common Sense Media's Jeffrey M. Anderson gave the film 2/5 stars, writing, \"Despite a diverse cast and a nifty location, this soggy, inert horror movie unfolds with a most unimaginative collection of worn-out genre staples, starting with its bland title.\"",
        "Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3/4 stars, writing, \"There's nothing subtle or deeply original about Fear, though it does feature some impressive albeit low-budget special effects, first-rate production design and strong performances from the cast; it knows we've seen a dozen other movies about a group of friends who meet up in the country for what they hope will be an idyllic weekend, only to see things quickly go from mildly disturbing to truly weird to deeply concerning to horrifying bloody.\""
