It received generally negative reviews and grossed $2.1 million.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis article needs an improved plot summary. Please help improve the plot summary. (February 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nA weekend vacation turns sinister when a group of friends confronts their worst fears one by one.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJoseph Sikora as Rom\nAndrew Bachelor as Benny\nAnnie Ilonzeh as Bianca\nRuby Modine as Serena\nIddo Goldberg as Michael\nTerrence Jenkins as Russ\nJessica Allain as Meg\nTip \"T.I.\" Harris as Lou\nProduction[edit]\nFear, originally titled Don't Fear, was shot in 17 days in Kyburz, California,[1] during the COVID-19 pandemic in August 2020.[7]\nThe film's score was composed by Geoff Zanelli, who scored several of Taylor's previous films.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nFear was set to be released on Valentine's Day weekend in 2022, as the first release of Hidden Empire Film Group's new distribution company, Hidden Empire Releasing.[9] The film was released in the United States on January 27, 2023.[10] It released via video on demand on April 25, 2023.[citation needed]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 21% of 19 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.9/10.[11]\nMatthew Monagle of The Austin Chronicle wrote, \"It is frustrating to watch Fear carelessly oscillate between creature feature, haunted house movie, and folk horror... In the end, the scariest thing about Fear is its stock video opening montage \u2013 not a compliment any director wants to hear.\"[12] Katie Walsh of the Tribune News Service praised the cinematography, score and sound design, but criticized the script as \"prov[ing] that it is possible to have too many ideas for just one film.\" She added, \"Deadliest of all, Fear is just not scary. The jump scares don't land, the fears themselves are all a bit silly and it feels like Taylor is holding back for the majority of the run time.\"[13] Common Sense Media's Jeffrey M. Anderson gave the film 2/5 stars, writing, \"Despite a diverse cast and a nifty location, this soggy, inert horror movie unfolds with a most unimaginative collection of worn-out genre staples, starting with its bland title.\"[14]\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3/4 stars, writing, \"There's nothing subtle or deeply original about Fear, though it does feature some impressive albeit low-budget special effects, first-rate production design and strong performances from the cast; it knows we've seen a dozen other movies about a group of friends who meet up in the country for what they hope will be an idyllic weekend, only to see things quickly go from mildly disturbing to truly weird to deeply concerning to horrifying bloody.\"[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Tangcay, Jazz (August 12, 2020). \"How Filmmaker Deon Taylor Shot a Film in 17 Days During Quarantine\".
