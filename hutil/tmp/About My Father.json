Despite the clash between their two cultures and initial perception of having nothing in common, they eventually become a single, unified family by the end of the summer holiday weekend.[3]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nRobert De Niro as Salvo Maniscalco\nSebastian Maniscalco as himself\nLeslie Bibb as Ellie\nKim Cattrall as Tigger\nDavid Rasche as Bill\nAnders Holm as Lucky\nBrett Dier as Doug\nProduction[edit]\nOn April 26, 2018, it was announced that Sebastian Maniscalco was set to star in an untitled film for Lionsgate, inspired by his life, with Austen Earl attached to co-write the screenplay alongside Maniscalco.[4] There were no further developments until May 12, 2021, when it was announced that Laura Terruso was set to direct the film and Robert De Niro was cast in a lead role. De Niro actually met Maniscalco's father, for research on playing him.[5] American Pie's Chris and Paul Weitz were attached to produce the film alongside Andrew Miano for their production company Depth of Field.[6] In September 2021, Leslie Bibb and Kim Cattrall joined the lead cast.[7][8] In November 2021, Brett Dier, Anders Holm, and David Rasche joined the cast.[9]\nPrincipal photography began on September 21, 2021, in Mobile, Alabama, and lasted for one month.[10][11]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released by Lionsgate on May 26, 2023.[3]\nAbout My Father was released for digital platforms on June 16, 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on August 1, 2023.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nAbout My Father grossed $12.1\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $6.1\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $18.2\u00a0million.[2][1]\nIn the United States and Canada, About My Father was released alongside The Little Mermaid, Kandahar, The Machine, and You Hurt My Feelings, was projected to gross $5\u20136 million from 2,400 theaters over its four-day Memorial Day opening weekend.[13] The film made $1.5 million on its first day, including $285,000 from Thursday night previews.[14] It went on to debut to $4.3 million (and $5.4 million over the four-day frame), finishing sixth.[15] In its second weekend, the film declined 52% to $2.1\u00a0million, finishing in seventh place.[16][17]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 36% of 86 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"About My Father finds star/co-writer Sebastian Maniscalco drawing on his own life for material -- and inadvertently proving that a funny standup routine doesn't necessarily make for an entertaining film.\"[18] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[19] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an overall 80% positive score, with 51% saying they would definitely recommend it.[15]\nMatt Zoller Seitz, in a review for RogerEbert.com stated: \"De Niro, bless his heart, is the engine that keeps this refurbished jalopy puttering along for 90 minutes. There are a couple of scenes that suggest the stronger, more fascinating movie that might've been\".[20] InSession Film's M.N. Miller called Maniscalco's film \"A culture clash farce that works because of Maniscalco's style of comedy and De Niro playing to his long-established comic strengths as a cynical curmudgeon set in his ways.\"[21]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nAt the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress for Kim Cattrall.[22]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"About My Father \u2013 Financial Information\".
