The film stars Patel, Sharlto Copley, Pitobash Tripathy, Vipin Sharma, Sikandar Kher, Adithi Kalkunte, Sobhita Dhulipala, Ashwini Kalsekar, Makarand Deshpande, Jatin Malik, and Zakir Hussain.\nMonkey Man premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2024, and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada by Universal Pictures on April 5, 2024. The film received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn a forest village in India, Kid lives with his mother Neela and gets inspired with tales of Hanuman narrated by Neela. Baba Shakti, a ruthless spiritual guru in the nearby city of Yatana, sends Rana Singh, the corrupt police chief, to force out the villagers and acquire their land. The village is massacred, but Neela is able to hide Kid before Rana kills her, setting her body on fire. Kid's futile attempts to save her leave his hands terribly burned and scarred.\nYears later, Kid earns a living in Yatana as a monkey-masked fighter at Tiger's Temple, a bloody underground boxing club, where he is incentivised to lose. Kid's motive is to exact revenge on Baba, now an influential figure, and Rana, who frequents Kings, a luxury brothel run by Queenie Kapoor. To infiltrate the brothel, Kid has Queenie's wallet stolen under the pretext of returning it. Kid obtains a job in the kitchen, where he uses the alias \"Bobby\" from a cleaning product and befriends Alphonso, a gangster working for Queenie. Revealing his side job at Tiger's Temple, Kid helps Alphonso win a large bet on a bout in exchange for promotion to a waiter. \nKid is able to access the VIP floor to reach Rana. Buying a gun, Kid trains a stray dog to carry the weapon past security and spikes Rana's cocaine with powdered bleach in order to confront and shoot him in the bathroom. The assassination attempt gets spoiled and Kid is forced to fight his way out of the building. Fleeing in Alphonso's supercharged tuk-tuk, Kid crashes and gets arrested, but he escapes. The chase ends when Kid is shot by police, falling into a river. Kid is rescued by Alpha, the keeper of Ardhanarishvara, a local temple whose hijra community is being targeted by Baba's growing political movement. \nLearning that he is now a wanted fugitive, Kid recovers at the temple. Alpha guides him through a hallucinogenic experience to confront the trauma of his mother's death, encouraging him to train himself in combat. Now with a newfound purpose, Kid begins to fight for the marginalized as well. When the hijra's sanctuary is threatened, Kid returns to fight at Tiger's Temple, placing a large bet on himself. He emerges victorious with enough money to save Alpha's temple. During Diwali, Baba's candidate is elected and their nationalist party celebrates at Kings. Kid fights his way inside with improvised weapons, joined by Alpha and her warriors. \nQueenie attempts to shoot Kid, but is killed by Sita, one of the exploited prostitutes and Kid's co-worker. Using Queenie's severed thumb to access the penthouse, Kid confronts Rana and beats him to death in a fistfight. He finally reaches Baba, who wounds him with blades hidden in his padukas. Undeterred, Kid kills Baba using the same blades against him. Having finally avenged his mother's death, Kid collapses from his injuries, reminiscing about Neela and his devotion to Hanuman.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDev Patel as Kid / Bobby / Monkey Man\nJatin Malik as Young Kid\nSharlto Copley as Tiger\nPitobash as Alphonso\nVipin Sharma as Alpha\nSikandar Kher as Rana Singh\nSobhita Dhulipala as Sita[8]\nAshwini Kalsekar as Queenie Kapoor\nAdithi Kalkunte as Neela\nMakarand Deshpande as Baba Shakti\nZakir Hussain as a tabla maestro\nProduction[edit]\nOn October 29, 2018, it was reported that Dev Patel would make his directorial debut with an action thriller film titled Monkey Man, which he co-wrote with Paul Angunawela and John Collee, and was set to star in.[9][10][11] Initially, Patel tried to recruit previous collaborator Neill Blomkamp to direct but Blomkamp declined and suggested he direct it himself.[12][13] Speaking of his work on the film, Patel stated, \"I think the action genre has sometimes been abused by the system. I wanted to give it real soul, real trauma, real pain ... And I wanted to infuse it with a little bit of culture.\"[14]\nPatel had seen Pitobash Tripathy in Million Dollar Arm (2014), and invited the actor to audition for Alphonso.[15] Vipin Sharma, who had a small role in Hotel Mumbai (2018) starring Patel, was quickly cast as Alpha after a brief audition.[16] Prior to her first ever film role in Raman Raghav 2.0 (2016), Sobhita Dhulipala had auditioned for Monkey Man before getting her first film role in 2016, but did not hear back from the production team until 2019, when Patel confirmed that she got the part of Sita \"from the moment he saw her audition\".[17]\nInitially gearing up to shoot on location in India in early 2020, the film was postponed and nearly canceled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Patel then opted to shoot the film on a small island in Batam, Indonesia.[18] While filming the first action sequence, Patel broke his hand.[14][19]\nOn March 12, 2021, it was announced that filming was completed and Thunder Road Films had sold worldwide rights to Netflix for $30 million, described as \"John Wick in Mumbai\".[20] However, Netflix later felt the film was too gritty for Indian audiences and was concerned about their reaction to the film's political commentary, instead quietly shopping it around and nearly cancelling the release.[21][22] Of this decision, Patel said, \"[Netflix] didn't really know what they'd bargained for. The actual film itself is a lot denser and it's saying a lot... it's not your usual action scene on page one, and then you continue fighting nonstop. It's trying to do a bit more.\"[23] Sometime thereafter, Jordan Peele saw the film and came on board as producer under his Monkeypaw Productions banner and persuaded Universal Pictures to acquire the film from Netflix for under $10 million.[24] Patel later stated that Peele \"took us from this thing that was brushed under the carpet to putting us on top of the mantel piece.\"[25]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nJed Kurzel composed a new score for the film, replacing original composer Volker Bertelmann.[26]\n\nThemes[edit]\nMonkey Man explores themes of societal challenges, including corruption, discrimination, caste system, poverty and the experiences of the Hijra community in India.[27]\n\nRelease[edit]\nDirector Dev Patel at SXSW 2024\nMonkey Man had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 11, 2024.[25]  It had its Sydney premiere on April 2, 2024, attended by Patel and his partner, Australian actress Tilda Cobham-Hervey,[28] and was released in Australian cinemas on April 4.[29] The film was released in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland by Universal Pictures on April 5, 2024.[25][30][31]\nThe film is scheduled to release in India on April 19, 2024. However, it had reportedly been delayed amid concerns that the Central Board of Film Certification would require edits be made.[32][33][34] According to a report by Bollywood Hungama on March 31, the movie still had yet to be certified by the CBFC.[35] In articles for both IndieWire and Time, Indian film critic Siddhant Adlakha posited that the film's violent content and political themes might be the root cause for the delay.[34][36]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nAs of April\u00a018, 2024[update], Monkey Man has grossed $19.5 million in the United States and Canada and $5.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $25 million.[7][6]\nIn the United States and Canada, Monkey Man was released alongside The First Omen, and was projected to make around $12 million from 3,029 theaters in its opening weekend.[37] It made $4.3 million on its first day, including $1.4 million during its Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $10.2 million, finishing second behind holdover Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.[38] In its second weekend the film made $4.1 million, finishing in sixth.[39]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 256 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"An audacious effort from debuting director Dev Patel, Monkey Man dispenses action and sociopolitical commentary with equal aplomb.\"[40] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[41] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[38]\nPeter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, awarded four out of five stars, reserving praise for Patel's performance and calling it a \"stylish and exciting action thriller, which doubles as a boisterous satire of Modi-esque nationalism\".[42] Tim Robey of The Telegraph awarded three out of five stars, writing that \"The actor's directorial debut is an astonishingly violent, expertly staged John Wick-in-Mumbai slugfest\" but questioned whether it was \"a waste of his talents\".[43] Saffron Maeve, writing for The Globe and Mail, described the film as \"solid and blockbuster-audience friendly\", but that its \"woozy overediting [...] makes the theatrical experience tiring.\"[44]\nThe New York Times wrote, \"As the story comes into blurry focus, Patel gestures at the real world and folds in some mythology, but these elements only create expectations for a complex story that never emerges. What mostly registers is an overarching sense of exploitation and desperation: Everyone is always hustling someone else. That gives the movie a provocative pessimism\".[45] The Washington Post noted that \"Monkey Man addresses the inequities of India's caste system in ways more pointed than you would expect. The glimpses of Mumbai poverty are brief but harsh, and at one point Kid takes refuge in a temple of abused transgender women [...] There's also the matter of the movie's main villain, Baba Shakti\u00a0\u2014 a white-haired ultranationalist power broker who whips worshipful mobs into a frenzy and who may have looked a little too much like India's prime minister Narendra Modi for Netflix.\"[46]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Nemiroff, Perri (March 12, 2024). \"'Monkey Man' Review: Dev Patel Arrives as a Next-Level Action Star, at Last SXSW 2024\".
