    "Plot": [
        "Free City is a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game (MMORPG) developed by Soonami Studios. The players of Free City are distinguished from the non-player characters (NPCs) by the sunglasses they wear, and usually spend their time fighting each other and causing mayhem. Unaware that the world they live in is a video game, the NPCs are mostly oblivious to the chaos caused by the players while living out their scripted lives, including Guy, who works as a bank teller at Free City's bank with his best friend Buddy, a security guard. Unemployed software developer Millie Rusk is playing Free City to find proof for a copyright infringement lawsuit that Soonami stole the source code from the concept game she developed, Life Itself, which included novel artificial intelligence techniques for its NPCs. Her friend Walter \"Keys\" McKey is sympathetic, but reluctant to help, as he now works in technical support at Soonami.",
        "After Millie's avatar \"MolotovGirl\" catches Guy's attention by singing his favorite song \"Fantasy\", he begins to deviate from his programming, shocking Buddy by accidentally shooting a skull-masked player robbing the bank and leaving with his sunglasses. Believing Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC, Keys and his coworker Mouser unsuccessfully try to ban him from the game. Accessing the players' view of the game, Guy visits new areas and meets Millie at Revenjamin Buttons' stash house, where they attempt to steal evidence leading to her source code. Believing Guy to be a novice player, she advises him to level up before trying again. Guy rapidly progresses through the game by completing missions benevolently, standing out from other players and becoming a worldwide sensation known as \"Blue Shirt Guy\" while Soonami's CEO Antwan Hovachelik has the artists \"roid up\" his design for the sequel Free City 2.",
        "As Keys eventually realizes that Guy truly is an NPC, other NPCs that Guy interacts with also begin to develop self-awareness. Keys learns that Free City 2 is due to release in 48 hours and will completely replace Free City, terminating all of the game's NPCs. He informs Millie, and she tells Guy the truth about his existence, but he becomes distraught and breaks off contact. Guy talks with Buddy and realizes that there is something more to their existence, and they go get the evidence Millie wanted from a gamer who accidentally glitched through the edge of Free City's map and discovered an older build of Life Itself, recording the video clip in the process. Antwan sees that the popularity of Blue Shirt Guy threatens his plans to launch Free City 2 and orders a server reboot, which resets Guy's memories. Guy regains his self-awareness when Millie kisses him.",
        "Guy recalls the location of an island containing remnants of the Life Itself build and they attempt to reach the island before the Free City 2 launch wipes all old content from the servers. Antwan fires Keys, has every player removed from Free City, and sends an unfinished Guy-resembling character named Dude into the game. Initially overwhelmed, Guy then puts his sunglasses on Dude, distracting him and allowing Guy to proceed to the island. In a last-ditch attempt to stop him, Antwan begins smashing the game servers in the Soonami offices with a fire axe, erasing Buddy and much of the game world, while firing Mouser. Before he can destroy the final server, Millie offers a deal to abandon her lawsuit and surrender the profits of the Free City franchise to him in exchange for her creation.",
        "Sometime later, sales for Free City 2 have slipped because of bugs in the code and lagging online play. An embattled Antwan is in the crosshairs, but claims he is a victim. Millie salvages her code and along with Keys and Mouser, releases the indie game Free Life, which includes Guy, Dude, and the other NPCs from Free City. In the game, Guy reveals to Millie that his code is, in fact, a love letter to her from Keys: During the development of Life Itself, Keys had encoded what he knew about her tastes into an AI routine in the game, which was eventually incorporated into Free City. This explains why Guy felt uniquely drawn to MolotovGirl. After Millie leaves the game, she and Keys share a kiss. Meanwhile, Guy and Dude reunite with Buddy, who was reconstructed."

    "Production": [
        "In August 2016, Matt Lieberman spent three weeks writing the first draft of the spec script for Free Guy. This was sold and entered development at 20th Century Fox prior to being acquired by The Walt Disney Company. Free Guy is one of the first Fox films to continue production under Disney's ownership, as well as under the studio's new name of 20th Century Studios. Director Shawn Levy originally passed on the script. After he was introduced to Ryan Reynolds by mutual friend Hugh Jackman (whom Levy directed in Real Steel and Reynolds costarred with in X-Men Origins: Wolverine), Levy and Reynolds decided to work on Free Guy after rereading it together. Reynolds, who also produced the film, said, \"I haven't been this fully immersed and engaged in something since Deadpool.\" Levy had previously been attached to the film Uncharted, an adaptation of the video game series of the same name, before he left to make Free Guy.",
        "Principal photography began on May 14, 2019, in Boston, mostly around the city's Financial District. It also took place in the Massachusetts cities of Worcester, Framingham (in the former Framingham Savings Bank building), and Weymouth (at the former Naval Air Station), as well as at Revere Beach and the Paramount Pictures studio headquarters in Los Angeles, California. Filming concluded on July 31, 2019.",
        "Levy decided to hire production designer Ethan Tobman over other candidates with more feature film experience after being inspired by the energy he brought to the project. Together they created a visual bible laying out the rules for their video game world. To split the real world from the in-game look they specified colors, lenses, composition and framing, camera movement, and other details. Levy found it liberating to be influenced by other games and films but not required to make a direct adaptation of an existing franchise. Tobman said the film's game-world design drew primary inspiration from games like SimCity, The Sims and Red Dead Redemption 2, while also acknowledging thematic inspiration from Grand Theft Auto and Fortnite. In order to help Reynolds fully tap into his Guy character after Deadpool, Levy suggested that he tap into his Canadian background and act very friendly, full of joy, a typical Canadian citizen. He also found inspiration in Peter Sellers role in Being There and Will Ferrell role in Elf because they played characters who were similar to Guy's character being simple-minded.",
        "The film features several weapons from other video game and film franchises, including a Mega Buster from Mega Man, a lightsaber from Star Wars, one of Fortnite's pickaxes, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2, the portal gun from Portal, as well as Captain America's shield and Hulk's fist from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When the film was acquired by Disney, which owns the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, the filmmakers made a request to use iconic weapons from those properties, and were granted permission to use everything they requested. The cameo by Chris Evans was suggested by Reynolds' wife Blake Lively. Levy contacted Evans, who was already in Boston shooting Defending Jacob and asked if he would come by for ten minutes, and he agreed."

    "Reception": [
        "Free Guy grossed $121.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $209.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $331.5 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, Free Guy was released alongside Respect and Don't Breathe 2, and was initially projected to gross $15\u201318 million from 4,165 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making $10.5 million on its first day (including $2.2 million from Thursday-night previews), estimates were raised to $26 million. It went on to debut to $28.4 million, topping the box office. The film made $18.5 million in its second weekend, remaining in first. The drop of just 34% marked the smallest second-weekend decline of any wide release of the summer, and the second-best of Reynolds' career. In its third weekend, it was beaten by newcomer Candyman, but the film continued to hold well, falling by 27% earning $13.6 million.",
        "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 297 reviews and an average rating of 7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Combining a clever concept, sweet, self-aware humor, and a charming cast, Free Guy is frivolous fun.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.",
        "Peter Debruge of Variety magazine called the film an \"at-times unwieldy mashup of multiple-reality blockbusters like The Matrix and The Lego Movie\" and said that \"Free Guy is a lot of fun, despite the fact that Levy and the screenwriters seem to be changing the rules as they go.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times lauded both the \"perfectly cast\" Reynolds and \"superb and charming Jodie Comer.\" Giving the film three out of four stars, he wrote \"Thanks in large part to the vibrant, funny, sweet, endearing work by Reynolds and Comer, Free Guy delivers.\"\nA.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+ grade and said, \"For all its casual mayhem, Free Guy turns out to be a rather cuddly crowdpleaser, a high-concept blockbuster trifle with bubblegum ice cream clogging its circuits.\" Dowd contrasted the film with The Truman Show, saying \"Reynolds replicates that slightly unhinged Truman Burbank grin but not the desperation behind it.\" Nick De Semlyen of Empire was critical of the film; he compared it unfavorably to 2018's Ready Player One, and said that although it is \"eager to please\" it \"doesn't really hang together, even as you're watching it.\"."
