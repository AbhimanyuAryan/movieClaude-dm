    "Reception": [
        "Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 0% approval rating, based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 1.8/10. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, stating that it (along with several of the director's other films) was the equivalent of \"cinematic graverobbing\" and that one of the film's only fans will likely be O. J. Simpson. Guy Lodge of Variety also gave it a negative review, calling it an \"unabashedly tacky true-crime thriller\" and writing that \"it's a cheap, unloving death march of a movie\", though Lodge offered some praise to Mena Suvari in the title role."
