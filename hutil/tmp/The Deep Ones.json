If you're going to adapt Lovecraft, shouldn't focusing on those things be your primary order of business?[8]\nRoger Moore of Movie Nation rate the film 1.5 out of 4 rating and he wrote: If only the unintentional laughs, and the intentional ones, added up to something more than a vaguely canonical Lovecraft spoof.[9] On Culture Crypt the film has a review score of 45 out of 100 indicating \"unfavorable reviews\".[10]\n\nEmilie Black of Cinema Craze gave the film a 3.5/5 rating and wrote: \nThe Deep Ones is a low budget take on Lovecraft's work that modernizes the subject at hand and makes the most of it.[11]\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAnatomy Crime and Horror Film Festival\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe Deep Ones\n\nWon\n\n[12]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nChad Ferrin\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nJeff Billings\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Special Effects\n\nThe Deep Ones\n\nWon\n\n\nPeople's Choice Best Actor\n\nRobert Miano,Johann Urb\n\nWon\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Priscilla Ross Smith to head sales at 123 Go Films, launches AFM talks on Sitges horror (exclusive)\".
