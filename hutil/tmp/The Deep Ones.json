    "Reception": [
        "Alix Turner of Ready Steady Cut rate the film 1.5 out of 5 rating and wrote: Awful film that likes to think it's a modern, glamorous Lovecraft adaptation, but just looks cheap and sleazy. Mike McGranaghan of The Aisle Seat gave the film a rating of 1/4 and said: Writer/director Chad Ferrin doesn't build any mystery or suspense with the story. If you're going to adapt Lovecraft, shouldn't focusing on those things be your primary order of business?",
        "Roger Moore of Movie Nation rate the film 1.5 out of 4 rating and he wrote: If only the unintentional laughs, and the intentional ones, added up to something more than a vaguely canonical Lovecraft spoof. On Culture Crypt the film has a review score of 45 out of 100 indicating \"unfavorable reviews\".",
        "Emilie Black of Cinema Craze gave the film a 3.5/5 rating and wrote:"
