    "Plot": [
        "Greg's parents reveal that they are going away for the weekend and taking Manny with them. Rodrick takes advantage of this and informs Greg that they are throwing a party together. Greg invites Rowley over to help, but they both end up doing all the work while Rodrick sits and watches. He locks them in the basement while the party is happening, but Greg loosens the door knob and takes photos of the party as blackmail. In the morning, they are let out and Rowley runs home while Greg confronts Rodrick over what happened. They suddenly get a call from their mother Susan, who informs them that Manny got sick and they are coming home right away. The brothers quickly clean up the house and kick out leftover guests before switching the bathroom door, which has the words 'Rodrick Rules' permanently written on it, with Rodrick's door, though Frank later notices that the door does not lock properly.",
        "Following the incident, Greg demands Rodrick for advice in return for helping clean up the party. Rodrick gives in and tells him about his \"Rodrick Rules\" which deal with getting things done without making an effort. Greg quickly becomes impatient, but is calmed down when Rodrick teaches him how to play the drums. Greg meets his bandmates of L\u00f6ded Diper, one of whom is actually a 30-something year old man, who are going to enter a talent show. Greg is also in it, but is assisting Rowley with his magic act, something which he does not think will be a hit. Frank suspects that the boys are hiding something, but Susan is happy to see them getting along. When Frank asks about the door, Greg covers and claims that he accidentally slammed it too hard, explaining why it does not lock properly. Frank and Susan are going away for the weekend again, but this time, they will leave the boys with Grandpa at the nursing home, which Rodrick seems overly eager about.",
        "At the nursing home, Rodrick reveals that the board games contain plenty of Mom Bucks they can use back at home. He gives some to Greg, but his pants get wet during a game and he is forced to change in the lobby bathroom. Greg accidentally ends up in the women's room where he gets accused of being a peeping tom. A chase through the old folks home ensues, but he manages to get back to the room. Later, Grandpa tells Greg that he knows that he and Rodrick did not want to come, but he admires that they hang out, something that Frank fails to do with his siblings. The next school day, Rowley reminds Greg that he needed to do his life science project and he rushes to Rodrick for help. He gives him his old science project on the condition that he hand over some Mom Bucks. Greg does so, but upon arriving at school realizes that it is a failed project about plants sneezing.",
        "Greg angrily reveals his blackmail to Rodrick and demands he pay up in Mom Bucks. However, he accidentally bumps into Susan who sees the photos and both boys are grounded, though Greg is still forced to do the talent show with Rowley. As payback, Rodrick reveals that he took photos of the pictures in Greg's diary about the restroom incident and threatens to send them to his friends who will send them to their siblings. They get the phone away from Rodrick, but Rowley accidentally sends the photos. To Greg's surprise, the story at school got twisted to being about Greg winning the top prize at a bingo competition and making a big getaway, making him popular. Greg is still depressed however as he has to do the talent show with Rowley, but just before entering, L\u00f6ded Diper approaches Greg about being their new drummer, as their replacement drummer Larry loves magic and would not mind switching places with him.",
        "Greg starts to question whether he should drum or not, but after Rodrick makes a scathing remark to him, he agrees. Upon seeing Rodrick solemnly leaving the show, Greg goes out to talk to him and explains that he simply wanted him to be proud of him and was worried they will grow apart. Rodrick tells Greg that he does care about him and that they will continue to hang out together. Greg gives Rodrick his position as drummer back, despite him still being grounded, and returns to L\u00f6ded Diper. Frank and Susan extend Greg's grounding, but Grandpa commends Frank for raising two good brothers while Susan excitedly dances to the band's song. Rowley's magic show ends up winning the competition while L\u00f6ded Diper gains a wider audience thanks to Susan. Despite their differences, Greg and Rodrick's brotherhood improves."
