        "Michael is a high school graduate living in North Hollywood, California with dreams of becoming a professional skateboarder. After being noticed by two professional skaters, Michael quits his water polo team to focus exclusively on skating. This leads to tension within Michael's relationship with his friends and his father. Michael thinks that his friends, Jay and Adolf, are not taking skating as seriously as him and he does not want to waste time with them. For this reason he starts to skate with them less and more with the professional skaters, which adds to the tension in their relationships. His father does not see skating as a realistic career and wants him to go to college and pursue stable employment. Michael is ultimately faced with the decision between choosing the future his father wants, or following his dream of becoming a professional skater."
