The film is loosely based on Alfred's life and his relationship with his father.[1] The film stars Ryder McLaughlin, Vince Vaughn, and Miranda Cosgrove.[1] Alfred began looking for funding to produce and direct the film in 2018, after being a co-producer on Mid90s (2018).[2]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMichael is a high school graduate living in North Hollywood, California with dreams of becoming a professional skateboarder. After being noticed by two professional skaters, Michael quits his water polo team to focus exclusively on skating. This leads to tension within Michael's relationship with his friends and his father. Michael thinks that his friends, Jay and Adolf, are not taking skating as seriously as him and he does not want to waste time with them. For this reason he starts to skate with them less and more with the professional skaters, which adds to the tension in their relationships. His father does not see skating as a realistic career and wants him to go to college and pursue stable employment. Michael is ultimately faced with the decision between choosing the future his father wants, or following his dream of becoming a professional skater.[3]\n\nCast[edit]\nRyder McLaughlin as Michael\nVince Vaughn as Oliver\nMiranda Cosgrove as Rachel\nNico Hiraga as Jay\nAramis Hudson as Adolf\nAngus Cloud as Walker\nTyshawn Jones as Isiah Jordan\nBob Worrest as Nolan Knox\nSparkle Tatyana-Marie as Rachel's friend\nBlake Anderson as School Security Guard\nGillian Jacobs as Abigaile\nSunny Suljic as Clark\nThomas Barbusca as Alter Boy\nGriffin Gluck as Drew\nNate Hinds as Rubo\nCameos[edit]\nThere are several cameos in North Hollywood, ranging from popular skaters, actors, musicians, and entrepreneurs.\n\nAndrew Reynolds, founder of Baker Skateboards and professional skater is seen at the table scene\nLouie Lopez, professional skater for Converse, Independent trucks, Hardies Hardware, and Mob Grip is seen at the table scene\nKader Sylla, skater sponsored by Baker Skateboards is seen as a ticketer in the film\nDavonte Jolly, skate filmer, is seen filming in the movie\nSunny Suljic, actor, musician and skateboarder also former member for Illegal Civ is seen twice in the movie, appear as character named Clark\nNa-Kel Smith, actor, musician, and professional skater for Fucking Awesome and Supreme is seen multiple times in the film\nZach Saraceno, a professional skater for Illegal Civ is seen in the film\nKevin White, professional skater for Illegal Civ, and sponsored by Hardies Hardware is seen in the film\nJason Dill, professional skater and co-founder of Fucking Awesome is shown as Father Mahoney in the film\nThe Garden, popular band from Orange County, California.\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere starting on March 26, 2021, at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.
