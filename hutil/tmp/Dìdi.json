        "D\u00ecdi had its world premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024. A few days later, Focus Features acquired distribution rights to the film. It also screened at South by Southwest on March 12, 2024 and is scheduled to be the closing film at Sundance's London edition on June 9, 2024. It is scheduled to be released on July 26, 2024.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, D\u00ecdi holds an approval rating of 90%, based on 30 critic reviews with an average rating of 7.6/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, the film holds a score of 77 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "In her review for The Guardian, Adrian Horton described D\u00ecdi as \"easily one of the best, most seamless films [she's] seen on the experience of growing up online\" and declared it a \"clear antecedent\" to Eighth Grade (2018). Scott Phillips praised the cast performances in his review for Forbes and concluded: \"It would be reductive to call Didi a 'feel good movie'. It never manipulates its audience, but it offers a great deal of comedy to go with its heavier themes. It feels like real life, finding the humor and the happiness that can be often be obscured by the challenges\"."
