Bruce, and DeCubellis, based on Lazarian's play Push. The film stars Victoria Justice, Matthew Daddario, Katherine McNamara, and Lucien Laviscount.[2][3] The movie employs a non-linear narrative, with the story doubling back on itself as characters explain various ruses and deceptions.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn New York City, Brooke Gatwick and Owen Shore are a young married couple who have been together since high school. Recently, they have been struggling with starting a family and Brooke opening her own art gallery, featuring paintings by Ansgar Doyle. Ansgar openly expresses an attraction to Brooke and constantly attempts to communicate with her in the middle of the night, irritating Owen.\nOwen wants to go to Paris for Christmas and secretly buys airplane tickets for after the exhibit\u2019s opening, hoping that decompressing will allow them to conceive a baby. However, Brooke wants to focus on the gallery. One night, Brooke sees odd text messages on Owen's phone and thinks that he may be cheating on her. Ansgar tells Brooke that Damien Light, a film director, is interested in buying his art and wants to meet with them in the Marias Hotel in Paris, which she reluctantly accepts. Frustrated with Brooke\u2019s sudden departure, Owen accepts an assignment in Las Vegas for when they would have gone to Paris. Later, Brooke catches Owen leaving in the middle of the night, further increasing her suspicions about his infidelity, especially when he visits an address that's advertised online as a sort of \"lovers' nest\".\nAt a bar with his friend, Adam, Owen meets Amy, who says that she's a journalism major at Columbia. Amy recognizes Owen from his news program and starts flirting with him. Eventually, Owen takes Amy back to his home, where they have sex. They are interrupted by Brooke\u2019s text messages. Owen, regretting their tryst, asks Amy to leave and to never meet again; Amy asks Owen for help with her career after she graduates.\nAfter closing the deal in Paris, Brooke returns early to New York. Ansgar wants to display a nude painting of Brooke as the centerpiece of his gallery showing. On the night of the opening, Owen notices how close Ansgar and Brooke seem to be. Amy appears at the opening and attracts Ansgar\u2019s attention. Owen lies to Brooke about meeting Amy at a bar the other night. Owen and Ansgar get into a fight, and Amy asks Ansgar to take her home. On their way to their apartment, Brooke begins poking holes in Owen\u2019s story and even shows him an autographed napkin that Owen gave Amy the night at the bar. Owen eventually admits to sleeping with Amy, and Brooke angrily leaves while taking Owen\u2019s phone to see what he's been doing at odd hours of the night.\nAnsgar drops Amy off at Brooke and Owen\u2019s apartment, where Amy tells Owen that she met Brooke several days ago. Brooke's friend Eleanor suggested hiring a \"decoy\" to test Owen\u2019s faithfulness. While Amy is at the bar with Owen, Brooke texts her to cancel the ruse, but Amy ignores Brooke. On the day of the art opening, Amy meets with Brooke and lies about what happened with Owen as well as giving her the autographed napkin as proof that she did meet with him. Brooke pays Amy and invites her to the opening.\nAfter dropping by Eleanor and Adam\u2019s apartment, Brooke goes through Owen\u2019s phone and finds out that he was not seeing other women but was working on a story about an unfaithful senator. \"Sarah\" is really one of Owen's work colleagues and had arranged an apartment for him and Brooke if they go to Paris. Brooke goes back to her apartment to find Owen and Amy talking. Amy apologizes for crossing a professional line (after promising Brooke that she wouldn't actually have sex with Owen). Owen is upset that his wife created a situation that lured him into cheating on her. Amy gives back the money that Brooke paid her before leaving the apartment.\nOwen asks if Brooke cheated on him with Ansgar in Paris, but Brooke refuses to answer. During Brooke\u2019s time in Paris, Ansgar tries to seduce her. The movie shows Brooke partially undressed, but Brooke refuses to confirm or deny if she actually had sex with Ansgar.\nOwen packs a piece of luggage for his trip to Las Vegas. Before he leaves, he shows Brooke the tickets that he bought for Paris, which they can still use. She thinks for a second about the future where she sees a daughter with them in Paris so she accepts him at last.\n\nCast[edit]\nVictoria Justice as Brooke Gatwick, who quits her job to open her own art gallery\nMatthew Daddario as Owen Shore, Brooke's husband and a news reporter\nKatherine McNamara as Amy, a blonde hired by Brooke to check on her husband Owen if he cheats\nLucien Laviscount as Ansgar Doyle, an Irish street artist known for his paintings of nude women\nRonny Chieng as Adam, Owen's friend and a divorce attorney\nLindsey Broad as Eleanor, Adam's wife who is also a divorce attorney, and Brooke's friend\nRelease[edit]\nVertical Entertainment released the movie on March 12, 2021, in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland, in select theaters and via paid video on demand.[2]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 10 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ McNamara, Tara (March 12, 2021). \"Trust Movie review\".
