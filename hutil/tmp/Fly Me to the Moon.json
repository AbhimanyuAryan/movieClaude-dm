The film stars Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Nick Dillenburg, Anna Garcia, Jim Rash, Noah Robbins, Colin Woodell, Christian Zuber, Donald Elise Watkins, Ray Romano, and Woody Harrelson. Its plot follows the relationship between a marketing specialist and a NASA employee during the 1960s Space Race.\nFly Me to the Moon is scheduled to be released theatrically in the United States and Canada by Columbia Pictures through Sony Pictures Releasing on July 12, 2024, before streaming on Apple TV+ at a later date.[1][3][4]\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nDuring the 1960s Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, a relationship develops between the NASA director in charge of the Apollo 11 launch and the marketing specialist brought in to fix NASA's public image and stage a \"back-up\" fake moon landing.[5]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nScarlett Johansson as Kelly Jones[6]\nChanning Tatum as Cole Davis[6]\nNick Dillenburg\nAnna Garcia\nJim Rash as Lance Vespertine\nNoah Robbins\nColin Woodell\nChristian Zuber\nDonald Elise Watkins\nRay Romano as Henry Smalls\nWoody Harrelson as Moe Berkus\nJoe Chrest as Senator Vanning\nArt Newkirk\nAshley Kings\nJonathan Orea Lopez\nEva Pilar\nChad Crowe\nWill Jacobs\nMelissa Litow\nLauren Revard\nProduction[edit]\nIn March 2022, Apple Studios announced they had acquired the rights to produce a movie set in the backdrop of the Space Race, then titled Project Artemis, for $100\u00a0million. Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans were also announced as starring in the film, with Jason Bateman directing.[7] In May, Bateman said the working title Project Artemis was likely to change.[8] He left the project the following month, citing creative differences,[9] and was later replaced by Greg Berlanti, his first directorial effort since 2018's Love, Simon.\nThe search for a new director and Berlanti's availability changed the production schedule, forcing Evans to drop out as well. In July, Channing Tatum entered negotiations to replace him.[10] In September, Jim Rash joined the cast.[11] Ray Romano, Anna Garcia and Woody Harrelson would be added in the following months.[12][13][14]\nFilming began on October 27, 2022, in Atlanta, with a casting call issued seeking extras to play NASA employees and FBI agents.[15] In April 2024, Daniel Pemberton was confirmed to be composing the score for the film.[16]\n\nRelease[edit]\nFollowing their partnership on Napoleon, Apple entered another agreement with Sony Pictures to distribute the film in theatres in December 2023.[17] That same month, it was scheduled for a theatrical release in the United States and Canada on July 12, 2024, with the film no longer titled Project Artemis.[18][1] In April 2024, the film's new title was revealed to be Fly Me to the Moon.[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Saperstein, Pat (December 21, 2023). \"Sony Dates Scarlett Johansson-Channing Tatum Film, George Clooney and Brad Pitt's 'Wolfs' for 2024\".
