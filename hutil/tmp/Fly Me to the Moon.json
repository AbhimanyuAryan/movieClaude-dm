        "In March 2022, Apple Studios announced they had acquired the rights to produce a movie set in the backdrop of the Space Race, then titled Project Artemis, for $100\u00a0million. Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans were also announced as starring in the film, with Jason Bateman directing. In May, Bateman said the working title Project Artemis was likely to change. He left the project the following month, citing creative differences, and was later replaced by Greg Berlanti, his first directorial effort since 2018's Love, Simon.",
        "The search for a new director and Berlanti's availability changed the production schedule, forcing Evans to drop out as well. In July, Channing Tatum entered negotiations to replace him. In September, Jim Rash joined the cast. Ray Romano, Anna Garcia and Woody Harrelson would be added in the following months.",
        "Filming began on October 27, 2022, in Atlanta, with a casting call issued seeking extras to play NASA employees and FBI agents. In April 2024, Daniel Pemberton was confirmed to be composing the score for the film."
