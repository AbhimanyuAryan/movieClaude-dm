As a direct sequel to the 2018 film The Kissing Booth and the second installment in the Kissing Booth trilogy (itself based on The Kissing Booth books by Beth Reekles), the film stars Joey King, Joel Courtney and Jacob Elordi.\nThe film was released on July 24, 2020, by Netflix. Like its predecessor, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. A third installment was released on August 11, 2021.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nElle's senior year begins with classmates gossiping that she and Noah will soon break up. This makes her fear elevate as Noah has befriended an attractive British girl named Chloe on Instagram.\nElle and Lee are planning the kissing booth again for the Charity Fair. So, he is trying to convince her to ask Marco Pe\u00f1a, the new transfer student dubbed the new \"Noah Flynn,\" to be one of the kissers. Beating Marco on the dancing game, she forces him to participate in the booth. \nNoah suggests Elle apply to Harvard, which clashes with her plans to study at University of California, Berkeley with Lee (where their moms met and became friends). So, Elle does it secretly. Talking with her father about college tuition, Elle learns money is a problem, and decides to participate with Lee in a dance competition with a huge cash reward for first place. \nElle visits Noah in Boston, meeting his new friends and Chloe, making her more insecure. She finds Chloe's earring under Noah's bed, which causes her to leave Boston. Confronting Noah, he assures her nothing has happened between him and Chloe and he asks her to trust him, though she is still skeptical. \nLee slips during one of their practice sessions (later revealed to be fake) so proposes that Marco become her dance partner, which she isn't too happy about but eventually does. As Marco and Elle start spending time together, they grow closer, and an attraction starts to develop between them.\nUnbeknownst to Elle, Lee's having problems with Rachel, as Elle goes everywhere with them and does not give them alone time. After forgetting Rachel waiting at the movies, she asks Lee to talk with Elle, which he promises but never does. The Halloween Dance arrives, and Lee forgets to tell Rachel they changed costumes (Rachel was a marshmallow while Lee and Elle were going to be crackers making a smore), further upsetting her. Elle shares a dance with Marco, almost kissing him but stops upon hearing people gossiping about her.\nLee finds in his car trunk Elle's application to Harvard, angering him. Elle and Marco excel at their performance, and she kisses him at the end of their dance, not knowing Noah was in the crowd, causing him to walk away.\nThanksgiving dinner happens at the Flynn's. Noah brings Chloe, upsetting Elle. Lee then confronts her for not telling him about her application to Harvard and Rachel is also upset with her. During dinner, Rachel discovers Lee never spoke with Elle and leaves. When he catches up with her, Rachel breaks up with him. Although Elle tries to convince Rachel to reconcile with Lee, she is unsuccessful. Elle also returns the earring to Chloe, who confirms it's hers. Later on, Chloe confides to Noah that one night she'd slept in Noah's room when he was away and must've lost it.\nThe carnival day arrives, and Lee and Rachel reconcile after being blindfolded and kissing at the kissing booth. Elle is also blindfolded and is approached by Marco, who wants to talk with her about their feelings. Although she admits there is an attraction between them, she tells him she loves Noah and goes looking for him at the airport. \nAt LAX, Chloe tells her that he went to look for her, and Elle finds him in the park where they first kissed. Noah confesses to being embarrassed as initially he wasn't doing as well at Harvard as he'd hoped. He also wants a connection with Chloe like Elle has with Lee. Elle and Noah reunite.\nA few months later Noah returns, and Elle, Lee, and Rachel graduate. Lee shares with Elle that he was accepted at Berkeley and asked if she received a response. She tells them she was waitlisted at both Berkeley and Harvard. When Elle opens both envelopes in her room, it turns out she was accepted to both universities, so she has to make a decision: go to Harvard with Noah or Berkeley with Lee.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJoey King as Elle Evans\nJoel Courtney as Lee Flynn\nJacob Elordi as Noah Flynn\nTaylor Zakhar Perez as Marco Valentin Pe\u00f1a\nMaisie Richardson-Sellers as Chloe Winthrop\nMolly Ringwald as Mrs. Flynn\nMeganne Young as Rachel\nStephen Jennings as Mike Evans\nChloe Williams as Joni Evans\nMorn\u00e9 Visser as Mr. Flynn\nBianca Bosch as Olivia\nZandile Madliwa as Gwyneth\nCamilla Wolfson as Mia\nCarson White as Brad Evans\nJudd Krok as Ollie\nFrances Sholto-Douglas as Vivian\nEvan Hengst as Miles\nSanda Shandu as Randy\nHilton Pelser as Barry\nTrent Rowe as Melvin\nMichelle Allen as Heather\nJoshua Eddy as Tuppen\nNathan Lynn as Cameron\nByron Langley as Warren\nDavid Morin as Principal Morin\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn February 2019, it was announced Joey King, Joel Courtney and Jacob Elordi would reprise their roles, with Vince Marcello directing from a screenplay he wrote alongside Jay Arnold, with Netflix distributing.[1] In May 2019, Maisie Richardson-Sellers and Taylor Zakhar Perez joined the cast of the film, with Meganne Young, Carson White and Molly Ringwald reprising their roles.[2]\nPrincipal photography concluded in August 2019, taking place in South Africa.[3]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released on July 24, 2020 on Netflix.[4][5] It was the top-streamed film in its opening weekend, while the first film ranked third.[6] It placed second in its sophomore weekend, with Forbes noting it as \"one of the most popular movies ever on the platform.\"[7][8] In October 2020, Netflix reported 66 million households watched the film over its first four weeks of release.[9]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 27% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Joey King makes The Kissing Booth 2 better than it could have been, but this slapdash sequel will leave viewers puckering up for all the wrong reasons.\"[10] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[11]\nIndieWire's Kate Erbland gave it a grade C+, and wrote: \"While it offers some necessary growth for all of its characters, The Kissing Booth 2 can never resist looking and acting like dozens of other offerings of its genre ilk, unable to grow beyond basic complications and done-to-death dramas. And yet there are hints that its evolution has a few more tricks left to employ, its winking conclusion only one of them.\"[12] Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent gave the film a score of 2 out of 5 stars, writing: \"To The Kissing Booth 2\u2019s credit, it\u2019s not as aggressively problematic as its predecessor.\"[13]\nAdam Graham of The Detroit News gave the film a grade of B, writing that the film \"is a sun-kissed fantasy with an appealing cast and a slick presentation that provides an easy escape, and that's OK, too.\"[14] Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film \"wades into the quagmire of what happens when the glow fades from a new relationship\", and concluded: \"As I might have said during my own high school days, The Kissing Booth 2 is \u201cmad stupid,\u201d but it\u2019s still not as overtly slappable as Netflix\u2019s other low-budget teen comedies.\"[15]\n\nSequel[edit]\nMain article: The Kissing Booth 3\nThe Kissing Booth 3 was released on Netflix worldwide on Wednesday, August 11 at 12am PT and 3am ET in the US.[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Hipes, Patrick (February 14, 2019). \"'The Kissing Booth' Getting Netflix Sequel\".
