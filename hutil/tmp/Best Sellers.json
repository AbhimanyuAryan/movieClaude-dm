To keep it afloat in face of a recent streak of disastrous releases, she seeks the help of cantankerous old writer Harris Shaw, a legendary author who hasn't published a book in 50 years. Lucy has a contract that stipulates Shaw still owes the publishing house a book and is required to do a book tour for it.
