        "In 2021, Bruce Willis signed on to star in the action film Wrong Place, with filming commencing later that year. In March 2022, the film's director Mike Burns, who previously directed another Bruce Willis film Out of Death, said, \"before filming commenced on Wrong Place in 2021, I asked one of Willis's associates how the actor felt and was told he was much better than last year. I took the associates' word for it, but soon realized that Willis was worse. After I finished filming, I said, 'I'm done. I won't make another movie with Bruce Willis.' I'm relieved that he's on vacation.\" Wrong Place is one of the last films to star Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia."

        "Brian Orndorf, of Blu-ray.com, gave a negative review, writing \"Wrong Place is as worthless and tiresome as Out of Death, and let's hope the production team doesn't make this a yearly event.\" Julian Roman, of MovieWeb, also gave a negative review, saying the film had an \"absurd plot, terrible script, and amateurish direction.\" Maxwell Rabb, of Chicago Reader, gave a negative review, saying \"Wrong Place is a convoluted mess that struggles to connect disjunctive plot points as they dawdle their way to the movie's inevitable conclusion\". Tara McNamara, of Common Sense Media, awarded the film one star out of five, writing \"throwaway action films like this one are known for featuring a former but memorable tough guy marquee name, a forgettable plot, low production budget, and a high weapon count\"."
