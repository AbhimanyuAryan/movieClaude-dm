I took the associates' word for it, but soon realized that Willis was worse. After I finished filming, I said, 'I'm done. I won't make another movie with Bruce Willis.' I'm relieved that he's on vacation.\"[5] Wrong Place is one of the last films to star Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.[6][7][8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nWrong Place was released by Vertical Entertainment in limited theaters and VOD on July 15, 2022,[9][10][11] followed by its release on DVD and Blu-ray on September 20, 2022.[12]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAs of February 17, 2023, Wrong Place grossed $71,362 in Hungary, Turkey, and Portugal.[1]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 0% of 6 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 2.4/10.[13]\nBrian Orndorf, of Blu-ray.com, gave a negative review, writing \"Wrong Place is as worthless and tiresome as Out of Death, and let's hope the production team doesn't make this a yearly event.\"[14] Julian Roman, of MovieWeb, also gave a negative review, saying the film had an \"absurd plot, terrible script, and amateurish direction.\"[15] Maxwell Rabb, of Chicago Reader, gave a negative review, saying \"Wrong Place is a convoluted mess that struggles to connect disjunctive plot points as they dawdle their way to the movie's inevitable conclusion\".[16] Tara McNamara, of Common Sense Media, awarded the film one star out of five, writing \"throwaway action films like this one are known for featuring a former but memorable tough guy marquee name, a forgettable plot, low production budget, and a high weapon count\".[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"'Wrong Place' (2022)\".
