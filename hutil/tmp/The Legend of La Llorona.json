La Llorona is described as the evil spirit of a distraught mother who lurks near the water's edge and strikes fear in the hearts of all who see her. The spirit begins to torment the Candlewood family and kidnaps Danny. Along with their resourceful taxi driver Jorge, the family races to save Danny. They must navigate the spirit's power along with cartel thugs that roam the countryside."
