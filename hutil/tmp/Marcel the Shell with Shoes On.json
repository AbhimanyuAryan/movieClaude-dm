It is based on and serves both as a direct stand-alone sequel and prequel to the series of shorts of the same name written by Slate and Fleischer Camp. Slate reprises her voice role as Marcel, an anthropomorphic seashell. Fleischer Camp, Rosa Salazar, Thomas Mann, Lesley Stahl, and Isabella Rossellini also star. The film follows Marcel, a shell who lives with his grandmother, Connie, after posting a short film online bringing Marcel millions of passionate fans and a new hope of reuniting with his long-lost family.\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 3, 2021, and began a limited release in the United States by A24 on June 24, 2022, before its wide release on July 15, 2022, to critical acclaim and was eventually nominated in the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature category.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nFollowing the end of his marriage, documentary filmmaker Dean moves into an Airbnb and discovers Marcel, a one-inch-tall talking shell living in the home with his grandmother, Nana Connie, and Alan, his pet ball of lint.\nInspired by Marcel's whimsicality, resourcefulness, and fascination with the world, Dean begins filming Marcel's daily activities, most of which consist of gathering resources from the backyard in order to support himself and Nana Connie. Connie is wise but has some dementia. She tends to her garden assisted by insects she has befriended. Marcel and Connie share their mutual love of 60 Minutes and Lesley Stahl.\nAfter Dean uploads his first video about Marcel to YouTube, it quickly becomes a cultural phenomenon. Marcel is both flattered and overwhelmed with his newfound popularity, lamenting that his family is not around to celebrate it with him. Marcel explains to Dean that there used to be an entire community of shells on the property, including Marcel's mother, father, brother, and aunt. The shells would take shelter in a sock drawer when the house's previous owners, Mark and Larissa, started knocking objects over while fighting. Following one fight, Mark accidentally packed the shells into his suitcase while moving out, leaving Marcel and Connie the only ones left on the property.\nDean helps Marcel produce a livestream on the Internet asking for help in locating his family. The livestream gains a substantial number of viewers, but after Marcel shares his location with viewers, the house becomes a popular area for influencers. Marcel becomes dismayed after realizing most of the people who saw his videos are fans desperate to be associated with him but largely uninterested in helping him.\nThe constant attention to the house quickly begins to bother Marcel, who is worried about Connie's deteriorating health. Marcel convinces Dean to drive him around the city in search of Mark's car but is overwhelmed to discover how large and vast the world outside his house really is. Realizing that the world is too big to likely discover the car on his own, a discouraged Marcel returns home to find Connie has fallen off the top of a washing machine and cracked her shell. Marcel tends to her wounds and grows more protective of Connie.\n60 Minutes reaches out to Marcel in the hopes of doing a cover story. Despite Dean's encouragement, Marcel is reluctant to accept the offer, concerned with what the large production crew and more attention to the house would do to Connie's health. Marcel tells Dean he will not accept the interview until Connie is fully recovered. Dean confides this information to a fast-deteriorating Connie. Wanting Marcel to live a meaningful life of his own, Connie pretends to show signs of improvement around Marcel while encouraging him to accept the interview. Despite his strong reservations, Marcel eventually agrees to the interview, believing it may help him find his family.\nConnie's health continues to worsen as the day of the interview approaches. Connie and Marcel watch as the 60 Minutes crew sets up in the living room and are starstruck upon seeing Lesley Stahl in person. Marcel and Dean both participate in the interview. Upon its completion, Marcel and Dean struggle to find Connie before realizing she died while their segment was being filmed. Marcel buries Connie in her garden and grieves her. Dean signs a lease for a new apartment.\n60 Minutes calls Dean requesting additional filming after making new discoveries regarding the whereabouts of Larissa. The segment airs, showing that they were able to locate Larissa in Guatemala. Larissa then brings the 60 Minutes crew to Mark's house, where she and Mark get into an argument. Marcel urges Dean and the crew to check in Mark's sock drawer, where the entire shell community is discovered. They reunite in the Airbnb with Marcel, who is able to give Connie a proper funeral. Dean moves into his new apartment and begins dating again. Reunited with his family, Marcel confides to Dean that he often finds himself going to the laundry room window alone and feeling the wind blow through his shell. Marcel shows Dean the sound it produces, remarking on its beauty as he stares out the window.\nA closing scene interspersed with the early credits shows Dean introducing Marcel to his new apartment.\n\nCast[edit]\nJenny Slate as the voice of Marcel\nDean Fleischer Camp as Dean, a documentarian\nIsabella Rossellini as the voice of Nana Connie, Marcel's Italian grandmother, who calls him \"Marcello\"\nRosa Salazar as Larissa Geller\nThomas Mann as Mark Booth\nLesley Stahl as herself\nShari Finkelstein as 60 Minutes producer\nSarah Thyre as the voice of Catherine, Marcel's mother\nAndy Richter as the voice of Mario, Marcel's father and Connie's son\nNathan Fielder as the voice of Justin, Marcel's brother\nJessi Klein as the voice of Judy, Marcel's aunt\nPeter Bonerz as the voice of The Maestro\nJamie Leonhart as Shell Family (voices)\nConan O'Brien as himself[a]\nBrian Williams as himself[b]\nJesse Cilio as Darwin\nProduction[edit]\nChiodo Bros.

The critical consensus reads, \"Poignant, profound, and utterly heartwarming, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is animated entertainment with real heart.\"[22] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100 based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[23]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nOn July 20, 2022, Dean Fleischer Camp said that even with the film having animated characters living and interacting with a live-action world, it will be eligible for consideration to be nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 95th Academy Awards in 2023. He went on to say that in order for it to be considered, he and A24 will have to submit documentation to prove that it has met the requirements in which \"animation must figure in no less than 75 percent of the picture's running time. In addition, a narrative animated film must have a significant number of characters animated.\"[24][25] On November 9, 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officially deemed the film eligible for consideration in the Animated Feature category.[26] It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film,[27] but lost to Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio which would also win the Oscar afterwards.[28][29]\n\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nHeartland Film Festival\n\nOctober 16, 2022\n\nTruly Moving Picture Award\n\nDean Fleischer Camp\n\nWon\n\n\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards\n\nJuly 1, 2022\n\nBest Picture\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\n\nNominated\n\n[30]\n\n\nBest Indie Film\n\nNominated\n\n\nSaturn Awards\n\nOctober 25, 2022\n\nBest Animated Film Release\n\nWon\n\n[31][32]\n\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Awards\n\nDecember 2, 2022\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nWon\n\n[33]\n\n\nNational Board of Review\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nWon\n\n[34]\n\n\nNew York Film Critics Online Awards\n\nDecember 11, 2022\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nWon\n\n[35]\n\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association Awards\n\nDecember 11, 2022\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nRunner-up\n\n[36]\n\n\nWashington D.C.
