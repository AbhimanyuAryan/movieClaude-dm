    "Plot": [
        "In Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a once-successful abandoned pizzeria, a night security guard attempts to flee from the building but is captured and strapped to a torture device, which kills him.",
        "Sometime later, mall security guard Mike Schmidt is fired for assaulting a negligent father whom he mistook for a kidnapper. Mike's career counselor, Steve Raglan, offers him a job as a night guard at the pizzeria. Though initially reluctant, Mike accepts after social services threaten to take custody of his younger sister Abby and pass her to their estranged aunt, Jane, who desires the custody's monthly payments.",
        "During his first night on the job, Mike falls asleep and dreams about the kidnapping of his little brother, Garrett. He meets some children who also witnessed the crime, but flee when he approaches them. The following day, Jane hires a gang of vandals, which includes Abby's babysitter Max, to vandalize the pizzeria to get Mike fired and hasten Jane's custody of Abby. At Mike's shift that night, he meets police officer Vanessa Shelly, who explains that the building closed during the 1980s after some children were murdered there. Once Mike's shift ends and he leaves, the vandals break in, but the restaurant's animatronic mascots\u2014Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Mr. Cupcake\u2014kill the entire group. Max's disappearance forces Mike to bring Abby along on his next shift, in which the animatronics befriend Abby and Mike discovers that they are possessed by the ghosts of the missing children, who consistently mention a \"yellow rabbit\".",
        "On the fourth night, Abby is accidentally injured when she, Mike, and Vanessa are bonding with the animatronics. The next morning, Mike gets Jane to babysit a frustrated Abby as he goes back to the pizzeria and takes some sleeping pills. The children appear in his dream again and tell him that he can stay with Garrett forever in exchange for Abby. Mike initially accepts, but when he changes his mind, he is attacked. After being strapped to the torture device that killed the previous guard and narrowly escaping, Mike is cornered and injured by Foxy. Meanwhile, a damaged yellow Freddy animatronic, possessed by the leader of the children, kills Jane and takes Abby back to the pizzeria.",
        "Vanessa treats Mike's injuries and reveals that she is the daughter of William Afton, the serial killer who kidnapped and murdered Garrett and the other children. He hid their bodies in the animatronics, and now, their souls are under his control. Realizing that the animatronics plan to kill Abby and have her join them, Mike rushes to the pizzeria. The animatronics are defeated but are reactivated by Steve, who arrives wearing the \"yellow rabbit\" suit, and reveals himself to be William. Mike tries to incapacitate William, but is easily overpowered.",
        "Knowing the animatronics like drawings, Abby draws a picture of William murdering the children to free them from his influence and make them realize the truth. Vanessa attempts to stop William, but he stabs her. With Mike's help, Abby shows the drawing to the animatronics, who turn on William. Mr. Cupcake bites off part of William's suit, triggering its internal springlock mechanisms, which fatally wound him. As the animatronics drag William away, Mike and Abby carry Vanessa out of the collapsing pizzeria, who later falls into a coma and is hospitalized. Shortly after, Mike and Abby reconcile and resume their normal lives. Back at the pizzeria, the leader of the children watches a dying William before leaving him to his fate."

    "Production": [
        "In April 2015, Warner Bros. Pictures announced it had acquired the film rights to the Five Nights at Freddy's video game franchise with Roy Lee, David Katzenberg, and Seth Grahame-Smith set to produce the adaptation. Grahame-Smith stated that they would collaborate with franchise creator Scott Cawthon, who co-wrote the books in collaboration with ghostwriting firm Kevin Anderson and Associates, \"to make an insane, terrifying and weirdly adorable movie\". In July 2015, Gil Kenan signed to direct the film from a screenplay co-written with Tyler Burton Smith.",
        "In March 2017, Cawthon announced Blumhouse Productions as the film's new production company after Warner Bros. Pictures put the project in turnaround. In May 2017, producer Jason Blum said he was excited and working closely with Cawthon on the film. In June 2017, Kenan said he was no longer directing the film.",
        "In February 2018, Chris Columbus was announced as Kenan's replacement as director and writer, besides producing the film alongside Blum and Cawthon. In August 2018, Cawthon revealed that the first draft of the film's script, which he wrote with co-author of the Five Nights at Freddy's novel trilogy, Kira Breed-Wrisley, was completed, and it would involve the events of the series' first game. That same month, Blum wrote on Twitter that the film was aiming for a 2020 release. In November, Cawthon announced that he scrapped the script, despite being liked by Columbus and Blum, as he \"had a different idea for [the story], one that I liked better\". It contributed to a further delay to the film, for which Cawthon took full responsibility. In June 2020, during an interview with Fandom, Blum, when asked about the progress of the film, stated:",
        "In September 2021, Blum revealed that Columbus was no longer involved with the project, which was still in active development. In August 2022, Blum announced that Jim Henson's Creature Shop would be working on the animatronic characters for the film. In October, Emma Tammi was announced as Columbus' replacement as director, in addition to co-writing the screenplay alongside Cawthon and Seth Cuddeback.",
        "In December 2022, Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Five Nights at Freddy's-related YouTuber Dawko later revealed during a livestream that Hutcherson would portray the first game's security guard Mike Schmidt and Lillard would portray the franchise's main villain William Afton. He also revealed that Mary Stuart Masterson and Piper Rubio joined the cast as Mike's aunt Jane, and Mike's younger sister Abby, respectively. In March 2023, it was reported that Kat Conner Sterling and Elizabeth Lail were cast in the film. Lucas Grant and Jessica Blackmore were also cast in undisclosed roles.",
        "Mark Fischbach, also known as Markiplier, was contacted to have a role in the film as the security guard that preceded Mike before being murdered at the opening of the film, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with his own film Iron Lung.",
        "Principal photography was initially set to begin in March 2021. However, due to script issues, filming was delayed. Filming began in New Orleans on February 1, 2023, under the working title Bad Cupcake, with an estimated production budget of $25 million before tax incentives. Filming wrapped on April 3. Lillard began filming his scenes in mid-February.",
        "The Newton Brothers composed the film's score, while the fan-made song \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" by the Living Tombstone was featured in the end credits. \"Talking in Your Sleep\" by the Romantics is featured in multiple scenes where the song is performed by the animatronics."

    "Reception": [
        "Five Nights at Freddy's grossed $137.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $159.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $297.2 million.",
        "In the United States and Canada, Five Nights at Freddy's was released alongside Freelance and After Death, and was initially projected to gross around $50 million from 3,550 theaters in its opening weekend. After making $39.4 million on its first day (including $10.3 million from Thursday night previews, the biggest-ever for a film with a simultaneous streaming release), estimates were raised to $78 million. It ended up debuting to $80 million, topping the box office. The film had the second-best day and date opening weekend ever (behind Black Widow's $80.3 million in 2021), the best opening weekend for a horror film in 2023, the best opening from Blumhouse, topping Halloween's $76.2 million, and the second highest opening for a video game film behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie's $146.4 million the previous April. The film remained in first place the following weekend with $19.4 million, though the 76% drop was one of the largest of all time. On its seventh weekend, the film surpassed Split ($278 million) to become Blumhouse's highest-grossing release worldwide. Five Nights at Freddy's completed its theatrical run in the United States and Canada on December 21, 2023.",
        "Five Nights at Freddy's received generally negative reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 32% of 212 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Loaded with Easter eggs, Five Nights at Freddy's may be fun to watch for fans of the game, but most viewers of any other persuasion will find this adaptation muddled and decidedly unscary.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 77% overall positive score.",
        "Murtada Elfadl of Variety felt the animatronic characters were underutilized, with the film instead focusing on \"a baffling plot and backstory for their protagonist\". He also criticized a perceived lack of effective jump scares and concluded, \"In trying to adapt the game for the screen, they forgot what makes the original special, wringing unintentional laughter from its bizarre story instead of entertaining audiences\". Dylan Roth of The New York Observer gave the film a score of one out of five and wrote, \"There are jump scares, but no real thrills. There are jokes, but no genuine laughs\".",
        "The Guardian's Benjamin Lee gave a two out of five rating, arguing \"The low-stakes, late-night thrill we expect from the material never arrives, held back by a mixture of indecisive restraint and misplaced self-importance. Five Nights at Freddy's is somehow a slog to get through and will be promptly forgotten by morning\". The New York Times's Natalia Winkelmann expressed similar criticisms: \"...[Although] Five Nights at Freddy's, based on a popular video game franchise, reaches for horror-comedy flair, this dreary, mild adaptation never achieves the hybrid pleasures of a movie like M3GAN. You may chuckle, but it's hard to tell if the movie is laughing with you\". RogerEbert.com's Simon Abrams, giving a two out of four rating, was also negative: \"Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s has most of the right elements for a good post-Amblin kiddy fright-fest, except maybe good dialogue and distinct characters. Watching the movie, one gets the sense that the games' morbid personality has been sanded down to its most generic jump-scares and banal revelations.\"",
        "Meagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting gave a score of three out of five and wrote, \"It's the type of handsomely made, charming creature feature that'll play well at slumber parties or rowdy theaters full of obsessed fans, which is precisely its target audience. Five Nights at Freddy's won't scare the pants off of seasoned horror fans; the animatronic denizens of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria will likely make you want to hug them instead\". Total Film's Neil Smith scored the film a two out of five and ended his review, \"With robot heads containing flesh-mangling chainsaws, faces resembling that of battle-scarred Terminators, and the lumbering gait of Romero zombies, Freddy Fazbear and his pals would seem precision-tooled for terror. Sadly, though, they are about as scary as Barney the purple dinosaur in what is ultimately a ploddingly predictable, gore-lite yawner\".",
        "Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press stated: \"Caught between PG and R, as well as lost at the crossroads of inadvertent comedy and horror, the PG-13 Five Nights at Freddy's has to go down as one of the poorest films in any genre this year\". Similarly, the Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips condemned \"the film's attempt to be a cuddly version of Saw, with faces getting sliced open by a robo-critter's whirring saw blades\", going on to say \"To keep the PG-13 rating intact, the camera and editor cut away just before the splurch, nearly every time... The premise, meantime, of Five Nights at Freddy's... very likely would've made more sense as a straight-up R-rated splatterfest.\""
