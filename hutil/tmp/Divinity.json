        "Steven Soderbergh and Eddie Alcazar announced in September 2021 that they were collaborating on a new film with Alcazar directing and Soderbergh producing, and Soderbergh serving as executive producer. In April 2022, Scott Bakula and Bella Thorne joined the cast, and DJ Muggs would compose the music. The film uses stop-motion for an extended fight scene. The film was made without a script, according to Alcazar: \"There is no script for this film, so I was trusted with the virtue of doing my own thing. And I started drawing and sketching ideas, and that\u2019s pretty much how it all came about.\""

    "Reception": [
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 57% of 44 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.30/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.",
        "Jeannette Catsoulis, writing for New York Times, described the film as, \"an unintentionally comical sci-fi diatribe obsessed with beautiful bodies, bickering brothers and biblical symbolism\". She continued, \"the occasionally arresting visuals, though, are repeatedly undercut by dumb dialogue and often atrocious acting, the whole experienced through a wall of throbbing, squawking sound. This is not the movie to see if you are nursing a hangover\".",
        "Jacob Oller, writing for Paste, described it as \"a little like a self-important Barbarella, full of half-hearted titillation and taking place in that indistinguishable gray area between a moonbase and a Hollywood sex dungeon\", while Nadir Samara, writing for ScreenRant, had a more positive review, praising the visual style, casting, and world-building."
