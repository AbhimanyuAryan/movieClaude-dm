It stars Dev Patel as the title character, along with Aneurin Barnard, Peter Capaldi, Morfydd Clark, Daisy May Cooper, Rosalind Eleazar, Hugh Laurie, Tilda Swinton, Ben Whishaw and Paul Whitehouse.[5]\nThe world premiere was at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 5, 2019 and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on January 24, 2020 by Lionsgate and in the United States on August 28, 2020 by Searchlight Pictures.[6][7]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nDavid Copperfield is born to his widowed mother, Clara, and begins saving noteworthy quotes from his life on scraps of paper. As a child, he visits his nanny Peggotty's family in their upturned boathouse in Yarmouth and returns to find Clara has married the strict Mr. Murdstone. Bullied by his new step-aunt and beaten by his stepfather, David is sent to work in Murdstone's bottling factory in London, where he lodges with the Micawber family, who are always cheerful but pursued by their creditors.\nAs a young man, David still works at the factory, while the Micawbers are evicted by bailiffs and sent to debtors' prison. Informed of his mother's death only after her funeral, David wreaks havoc in the factory and departs for Dover to find his wealthy aunt Betsey Trotwood, his only living relative. Her lodger, the eccentric Mr. Dick, believes himself to be burdened with the late King Charles I\u2019s thoughts and, like David, jots them down. David attaches these notes to a kite for Mr. Dick to fly, helping clear his mind, and meets Betsey's accountant Mr. Wickfield (who likes his wine) and his daughter Agnes.\nAdmitted to a school for boys, David is befriended by classmate James Steerforth, who calls him Daisy and believes him to be a gentleman. Later, a butcher's lad mocks the two friends and David challenges him to a fight - David gets knocked out. Agnes tends to his wounds but David disappoints her by saying he thinks of her as a sister. Mr. Micawber briefly joins the school as a teacher, but is exposed by Steerforth as a former convict and fired. Mr. Wickfield's clerk Uriah Heep, who has previously been mocked by the boys, tries to blackmail David with knowledge of his past. At a farewell party at school, David meets Steerforth's mother, ignores his future employer, and falls in love with a somewhat ditsy girl named Dora Spenlow. He is hired as a trainee lawyer with Dora's father's firm in London, where he lives the life of a \"young gentleman\" and courts Dora.\nBetsey arrives in London with Mr. Dick, having lost her fortune and home, and David is forced to decamp with them to a slum dwelling offered by Uriah, who has been keeping Mr. Wickfield drunk and persuaded him to make him a partner. Uriah is also courting Agnes. David visits Pegotty's family in their boat-house with Steerforth, who runs away with Pegotty's adopted daughter Emily, leaving her longtime fianc\u00e9 Ham. Mr. Micawber now lives on the streets with his family and has pawned his beloved concertina, which he asks Mr. Dick to buy back. Instead, Mr. Dick steals it for him, and David invites the Micawbers to move in with him, Betsey, and Mr. Dick.\nDavid begins to write the story of his life as a book, using the fragments he has saved since childhood. Agnes asks David, Micawber, Betsey, and Mr. Dick for a letter written by Mr. Wickfield as evidence of Uriah\u2019s misdeeds. They confront Uriah, who has been embezzling funds \u2014 including Betsey\u2019s missing fortune \u2014 by forging Mr. Wickfield's signature, presenting the letter as proof. David punches Uriah after the villainous clerk strikes Betsey, and dismisses him. Recognising that she no longer fits in David's \"story\", Dora calls off their engagement, asking him to write her out of his book.\nEmily is spotted in London and confronted by Steerforth\u2019s mother, but rescued by David and Pegotty\u2019s family. She reveals that Steerforth abandoned her in France, but he will return the following day to Yarmouth. When a storm wrecks Steerforth\u2019s boat off the Yarmouth beach, Ham swims out on a line, but Steerforth refuses to be rescued and is drowned. Mourning his feckless friend\u2019s death, David realises he is in love with Agnes, who reciprocates. He publishes his book to great success, performing public readings of his story. His new career as a writer allows him to buy back Betsey\u2019s home for her and Mr. Dick and continue to support the Micawbers, and he and Agnes marry and have a daughter.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDev Patel as David Copperfield\nRanveer Jaiswal as 4\u20137-year-old David\nPeter Capaldi as Mr. Micawber\nHugh Laurie as Mr. Dick\nTilda Swinton as Betsey Trotwood\nBen Whishaw as Uriah Heep\nBenedict Wong as Mr. Wickfield\nGwendoline Christie as Jane Murdstone\nAneurin Barnard as James Steerforth\nMorfydd Clark as Dora Spenlow / Clara Copperfield\nDaisy May Cooper as Peggotty\nRosalind Eleazar as Agnes Wickfield\nPaul Whitehouse as Mr. Peggotty\nNikki Amuka-Bird as Mrs. Steerforth\nDarren Boyd as Edward Murdstone\nMatthew Cottle as Mr. Spenlow\nBronagh Gallagher as Mrs. Micawber\nAnthony Welsh as Ham Peggotty\nAimee Kelly as Emily\nAnna Maxwell Martin as Mrs. Strong\nVictor McGuire as Creakle\nPeter Singh as Tungay\nRuby Bentall as Janet\nDivian Ladwa as Dr. Chillip\nRosaleen Linehan as Mrs. Gummidge\nSophie McShera as Mrs. Crupp\nProduction[edit]\nFilming took place in Bury St Edmunds in July 2018\nIt was announced in February 2018 that Armando Iannucci would write, direct and produce a new adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel. Iannucci wrote the screenplay with Simon Blackwell.[8] Dev Patel was cast in the title role later that month.[9] In April, the supporting cast was added, which included Tilda Swinton, Hugh Laurie, Aneurin Barnard, Ben Whishaw and Morfydd Clark.[10] In May 2018, Peter Capaldi was cast as Mr. Micawber and pre-production was underway.[11]\nFilming began in June 2018 in Norfolk and Suffolk, with Gwendoline Christie, Benedict Wong, Paul Whitehouse and Daisy May Cooper joining the cast.[12][13] Scenes were shot in Hull,[14][15] Bury St Edmunds,[16] Weybourne[17] and King's Lynn in July.[18][19] Aimee Kelly was added to the cast that month.[20] Principal photography concluded in August 2018.[21]  It was the first theatrical film production of Dickens's novel in 50 years, and the first on-screen adaptation in 19 years.[22]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 5 September 2019,[23] followed by its European premiere on 2 October 2019, acting as the opening film of the 63rd BFI London Film Festival.[24] It was the Surprise Film at the 39th Cambridge Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom by Lionsgate on 24 January 2020.[25] In August 2019, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired North American rights to the film and scheduled the release on 8 May 2020.[26][27] However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema and the name Searchlight Pictures which was changed by Disney, it was theatrically released later on 28 August 2020.[28]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nAlthough it received critical acclaim, The Personal History of David Copperfield underperformed at the box office, as its North American release came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many cinemas were restricted from opening.[29]\nIn the United Kingdom, it took $2m in its first week and a total gross of around $8 million by the start of March, when the pandemic began to affect cinemas. In the United States, it debuted $520,000 from 1,360 cinemas in August; playing in 1,550 cinemas the following weekend it fell 24% to $361,000. It went in to gross $1.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $12.5 million in the rest of the world, for a worldwide total of $14.4 million[30] against a production budget of $15.6 million.\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 248 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"The Personal History of David Copperfield puts a fresh, funny, and utterly charming spin on Dickens' classic, proving some stories truly are timeless.\"[31] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[32] PostTrak reported that 74% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 50% saying they would recommend it.[33]\nWriting for The Observer, Mark Kermode awarded the film a full five stars and stated: \"It really is a wonderfully entertaining film, managing to both respect and reinvent the novel from which it takes its lead.\"[34]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nBritish Independent Film Awards\n\n1 December 2019\n\nBest British Independent Film\n\nArmando Iannucci, Simon Blackwell & Kevin Loader\n\nNominated\n\n[35][36]\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nDev Patel\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nHugh Laurie\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nTilda Swinton\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nArmando Iannucci and Simon Blackwell\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Casting\n\nSarah Crowe\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nZac Nicholson\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nSuzie Harman and Robert Worley\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Editing\n\nMick Audsley and Peter Lambert\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Make Up & Hair Design\n\nKaren Hartley-Thomas\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nCristina Casali\n\nWon\n\n\nLondon Film Week Awards\n\n1 December 2019\n\nBest Film\n\nArmando Iannucci\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nArmando Iannucci and Simon Blackwell\n\nWon\n\n\nBritish Academy Film Awards\n\n2 February 2020\n\nBest Casting\n\nSarah Crowe\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBoulder International Film Festival Awards\n\n5 March 2020\n\nBest Feature Film\n\nArmando Iannucci\n\nWon\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Film Awards\n\n12 December 2020\n\nBest Production Designer\n\nCristina Casali\n\nWon\n\n\n\n\nSt. Louis Film Critics Association Awards\n\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nCristina Casali\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nSatellite Awards\n\n15 February 2021\n\nBest Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical\n\n\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nBest Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical\n\nDev Patel\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nSuzie Harman and Robert Worley\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Art Direction and Production Design\n\nCristina Casali and Charlotte Dirickx\n\nNominated\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\n28 February 2021\n\nBest Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical Comedy\n\nDev Patel\n\nNominated\n\n[38]\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association Awards\n\n5 March 2021\n\nBest Comedy/Musical\n\n\n\nNominated\n\n[39][40]\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nSuzie Harman and Robert Worley\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nCristina Casali\n\nNominated\n\n\nCritics\u2019 Choice Movie Awards\n\n7 March 2021\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nSuzie Harman and Robert Worley\n\nNominated\n\n[41]\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nCristina Casali and Charlotte Dirickx\n\nNominated\n\n\nCasting Society of America\n\n15 April 2021\n\nFeature Big Budget \u2013 Comedy\n\nSarah Crowe\n\nNominated\n\n[42]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Personal History of David Copperfield\".
