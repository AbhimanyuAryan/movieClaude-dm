It follows the estranged daughter (Issa Rae) of a famous photographer who falls in love with the journalist (LaKeith Stanfield) who is investigating her late mother's life.

It received generally favorable reviews from critics and grossed $21 million.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nReporter Michael Block meets a man in Louisiana named Isaac to interview him about his life post-Hurricane Katrina. He takes an interest in one particular photo in Isaac's home of a woman named Christina Eames, and wants to know her backstory.\nIn the present day, Christina's daughter Mae inherits a safety deposit box upon her death which includes the same picture of herself and two letters. The first is to Mae and the second is for her to deliver to her father.\nBack in New York, Michael meets Mae who works as an assistant curator. She pulls Christina's archival material to show him.\nAttracted to Mae, Michael intentionally sets up a \"chance meeting\" with her at the French movie screening her gallery is showing. They flirt and decide to go on their first date, ending with a kiss. They begin to date but this coincides with Michael getting a job in London. He struggles to tell Mae about the move as their relationship is new, so begins to ignore her calls.\nIn the past, Christina has a flirtatious friendship with Isaac. Eventually, they begin to live together but she is bored of her life as she longs to pursue a career in photography. Without telling Isaac, Christina gets on a bus leaving for New York City, and gets a job as an assistant photographer. She calls her friend Denise to give her the good news, who tells her that her mother has passed away. At the funeral, Christina mentions that she is going to visit Isaac, but Denise tells her that he married shortly after she left.\nA few years later, Christina returns to her hometown with Mae. They take a photograph in her old home. While there, they run into Isaac who offers to bring them to dinner to meet his wife. Christina refuses and becomes very emotional, kissing Isaac's cheek and crying afterwards which Mae remembers, even as an adult.\nIn the present day, Mae meets Isaac and delivers the letter Christina wrote, letting him know that her letter revealed him as her biological father. He admits to suspecting it when he met Mae as a child, but was too afraid to ask Christina.\nMichael goes to meet Isaac to finish his article and is surprised to see Mae there. They spend the day together and at the end Michael tells her that he got a job in London. He will be leaving soon but would like to continue the relationship. Mae tells him long distance isn't practical. She then works on putting together a retrospective of her mother's work and finds a video where her mother says she wishes she had been better at loving people.\nWhile working in London, Michael gets an invitation from Mae to see a Kendrick Lamar concert. They meet up in NYC, where Mae finally confesses her feelings for him and they vow to work things out despite the distance.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nIssa Rae as Mae Morton\nDakota Paradise as Young Mae Morton\nLaKeith Stanfield as Michael Block\nKelvin Harrison Jr. as Andy Morrison\nChant\u00e9 Adams as Christina Eames\nJasmine Cephas Jones as Rachel Miller\nLil Rel Howery as Kyle\nTeyonah Parris as Asia\nRob Morgan as Isaac Jefferson\nY'lan Noel as Young Issac Jefferson\nCourtney B.
