        "In a celestial conflict, Lucifer leads a rebellion and is cast into Hell by God. Archangel Michael attempts to chain Lucifer, but denies his plea for support.",
        "In modern times, Laura investigates the angels' battle and is skeptical of its reality. A biotech firm, secretly a Lucifer-worshipping cult, aims to free Lucifer using the Shroud of Turin. The cult's leader Liz kills Father Marconi, steals the Shroud, and plans to use it to create a vessel for Lucifer.",
        "Michael, possessing a priest, learns of a prophecy involving a wicked woman and a beast birthing Lucifer's vessel. Lucifer breaks free as cultists bring Laura and three other women: Sophia, Brenda, and Mia to their facility. The Beast of the Earth captures Laura and Sophia, but Lucifer possesses Sophia and kills the rest judging them as inadequate leaving only Laura for Lucifer to possess. Michael rescues Laura, encountering fallen angels who reveal the cult's plan to bring Hell to Earth.",
        "Lucifer manipulates Laura, who momentarily breaks free, attempting suicide. Liz arrives, and Lucifer repossesses Laura to stop her. Michael retrieves his sword with the help of trapped souls. Laura gives birth to a child, fulfilling the prophecy. Michael reveals God's plan for the child to destroy Lucifer. Liz then decides to protect the baby and orders the cult's massacre.",
        "Michael saves Laura, and together they confront Liz, revealing the truth. Laura escapes with the child, and Michael battles the Beast. He closes the portal to Hell using explosives, destroying the facility. The child, now safe, is taken to the Vatican.",
        "In the aftermath, Michael frees trapped souls from Hell, narrating the world's salvation. Liz spots the child in a forest, whispering \"Lucifer.\" Lucifer's essence escapes but is then absorbed by the child."

        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 26% of 23 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.10/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 37 out of 100, based on six critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.",
        "Dennis Harvey writing for Variety said \"If they're game for CGI-laden eye candy that treats Biblical prophesies with about as much respectful seriousness as the National Treasure franchise did American history, they\u2019ll be rewarded with a lively if overstuffed popcorn diversion\".  Describing it as a mashup of The Da Vinci Code and Rosemary's Baby, he praised Frankowski's \"colorful stylistic\" direction but called Alan's script \"jumbled\".  Matt Donato from IGN gave the film a score of six out of ten, saying The Devil Conspiracy is a high-concept religious action flick with horror influences that sells its ambitions short but still entertains despite itself\"."
