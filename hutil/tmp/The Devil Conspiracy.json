Archangel Michael attempts to chain Lucifer, but denies his plea for support. \nIn modern times, Laura investigates the angels' battle and is skeptical of its reality. A biotech firm, secretly a Lucifer-worshipping cult, aims to free Lucifer using the Shroud of Turin. The cult's leader Liz kills Father Marconi, steals the Shroud, and plans to use it to create a vessel for Lucifer.\nMichael, possessing a priest, learns of a prophecy involving a wicked woman and a beast birthing Lucifer's vessel. Lucifer breaks free as cultists bring Laura and three other women: Sophia, Brenda, and Mia to their facility. The Beast of the Earth captures Laura and Sophia, but Lucifer possesses Sophia and kills the rest judging them as inadequate leaving only Laura for Lucifer to possess. Michael rescues Laura, encountering fallen angels who reveal the cult's plan to bring Hell to Earth.\nLucifer manipulates Laura, who momentarily breaks free, attempting suicide. Liz arrives, and Lucifer repossesses Laura to stop her. Michael retrieves his sword with the help of trapped souls. Laura gives birth to a child, fulfilling the prophecy. Michael reveals God's plan for the child to destroy Lucifer. Liz then decides to protect the baby and orders the cult's massacre.\nMichael saves Laura, and together they confront Liz, revealing the truth. Laura escapes with the child, and Michael battles the Beast. He closes the portal to Hell using explosives, destroying the facility. The child, now safe, is taken to the Vatican.\nIn the aftermath, Michael frees trapped souls from Hell, narrating the world's salvation. Liz spots the child in a forest, whispering \"Lucifer.\" Lucifer's essence escapes but is then absorbed by the child.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAlice Orr-Ewing as Laura Milton\nJoe Doyle as Father Marconi/Michael\nEveline Hall as Liz\nPeter Mensah as Archangel Michael\nJoe Anderson as Lucifer\nBrian Caspe as Dr. Laurent\nJames Faulkner as Cardinal Vincini\nSpencer Wilding as Beast of the Ground\nVictoria Chilap as Brenda\nWendy Rosas as Sophia\nNatalia Germani as Alina\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography took place in Prague and other Czech Republic locations from March to April 2019, under the working title, dEvil.[2][3]\n\nRelease and box office[edit]\nThe Devil Conspiracy was released at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival on September 10, 2022.[3] It was released  theatrically on January 13, 2023, in the United States and Canada.[4]  It grossed $765,218 in the United States and Canada.

Describing it as a mashup of The Da Vinci Code and Rosemary's Baby, he praised Frankowski's \"colorful stylistic\" direction but called Alan's script \"jumbled\".[7]  Matt Donato from IGN gave the film a score of six out of ten, saying The Devil Conspiracy is a high-concept religious action flick with horror influences that sells its ambitions short but still entertains despite itself\".[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"The Devil Conspiracy\".
