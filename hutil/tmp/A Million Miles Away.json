    "Plot": [
        "In the late 1960s and 70s, Jos\u00e9 is a young boy whose family travels from Michoac\u00e1n as migrant workers picking grapes in California, his parents hoping to buy a house back home after they\u2019ve made enough money. While they are working in the harvest season, Jos\u00e9 attends school and works in the fields with his family after. His teacher, Ms. Young, notices his potential and visits his parents at home to express her concern over the disruption to his studies by going back and forth as migrant workers. After his father is only paid partial wages for his work, he realizes Jos\u00e9\u2019s teacher was right to be concerned and the family decides to stay in California full time.",
        "Years later, Jos\u00e9 graduates from the University of the Pacific and is hired as an engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Feeling as if he needs to fit in better, he trades in his customized 1963 Chevrolet Impala for a used Mazda RX-7. While signing the paperwork, he meets Adela, whom he asks out. After an intimidating first meeting with her family, they see each other more until they marry. They have five kids and Jos\u00e9 continues to work successfully at the lab, now instructing the researchers who had previously ignored him.",
        "One day during class, Jos\u00e9\u2019s boss offers him a chance to join a team going to Russia to evaluate a shipment of enriched uranium the United States is looking to purchase for NASA, noting that a trip like that would look really good on an application to the NASA space program. After several rejections, Jos\u00e9 hand delivers his 12th application in person to Frederick Sturckow who trains incoming astronauts and is a veteran of the Space Shuttle program. He makes a positive impression on Sturckow and is accepted into the program shortly thereafter.",
        "Jos\u00e9 struggles with the training, falling further behind the rest of his class. When he learns of the death of Beto (a cousin and close friend of his), he loses focus and is exhorted by Sturckow to catch up with the rest or he may be dismissed from the program. He later has a conversation with the head trainer, Kalpana Chawla, who describes to him why going to space makes all of their hard work worthwhile, and ends by letting him know she\u2019s been selected as the Mission Specialist for STS-107 on Space Shuttle Columbia.",
        "As Jos\u00e9 sits with his family watching the broadcast of Columbia\u2019s re-entry, they are shaken when news comes in that Columbia didn\u2019t survive. Nevertheless, Jos\u00e9 continues on and begins excelling among his classmates at NASA.",
        "In 2008, Sturckow pulls Jos\u00e9 into a conference room to meet with the selection team, who informs him that he\u2019s been chosen to join STS-128 as their Mission Specialist. Jos\u00e9 visits Adela\u2019s restaurant outside the NASA grounds and tells her the news, with his family later watching him at the press conference. He quotes Beto's words to him that it's fitting for a migrant farmworker to go into the unknowns of space. As he enters quarantine in preparation for the mission, Adela visits him with a surprise: his former teacher Ms. Young, who tells him she\u2019s been waiting for this moment for over 30 years, having followed his progress and career, always believing in his enormous potential.",
        "The launch day finally arrives, Jos\u00e9 is prepared along with the rest of the crew who board the shuttle, and launch into orbit. After main engine cutoff, Jos\u00e9 looks around at the shuttle cabin and imagines seeing the same Monarch Butterfly that landed on his dad\u2019s arm the day their family decided to stay in California, hinting that he had achieved his destiny.",
        "Closing titles note that Mission STS-128 remained on board the International Space Station for 13 days, and that Jos\u00e9 had tacos and listened to Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s \u201cEl Hijo del Pueblo\u201d while there. Jos\u00e9 was the first migrant farmworker in space, and still picks grapes with his father today, albeit in his own vineyard: Tierra Luna Cellars in Lodi, California."
