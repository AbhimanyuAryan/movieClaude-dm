Written and directed by Kay Cannon, it stars singer Camila Cabello as the title character in her acting debut, alongside Nicholas Galitzine, Idina Menzel, Minnie Driver, Billy Porter and Pierce Brosnan. It is a jukebox musical, featuring pop and rock hits, in addition to several original songs.[2]\nDevelopment began in April 2019, when Sony Pictures announced a musical-style film of Cinderella, with Cannon writing and directing. The film was produced by James Corden, through Fulwell 73 with Leo Pearlman, Jonathan Kadin and Shannon McIntosh. Principal photography began in February 2020 at Pinewood Studios, and was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in August 2020 and concluded in September.\nCinderella was released in select theaters and digitally on Amazon Prime Video on September 3, 2021[3] to mixed reviews from critics. Commercialy, according to Samba TV, it was watched in 1.1 million U.S. households over its four-day Labor Day weekend debut and in 2.2 million households by the end of its first 30 days. According to the analytics company Screen Engine, Cinderella was the most-watched streaming movie during its opening weekend, as well as the most-watched movie musical of 2021.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nCinderella is an ambitious young woman who dreams of establishing her shop, Dresses by Ella. After she catches the eye of Prince Robert in passing, he disguises himself as a commoner and sets out in hopes of meeting her. Robert finds Ella among the local market vendors, trying to sell one of her creations. After some playful banter, he buys her dress for triple the original price. Robert invites Ella to an upcoming ball, where, he promises, she can mingle with people from around the world who will want to buy her designs.\nOn the day of the ball, Ella's stepmother Vivian forbids her to attend, as Ella has already been promised in marriage to Thomas the vegetable merchant. Vivian throws ink on Ella's dress, ensuring that only her own daughters Malvolia and Narissa can attend. \nThough Ella's hopes are dashed, her fairy godparent, Fab G, comes to her aid. He uses magic to outfit her in a gown of her own design and a pair of glass shoes. Mice become footmen for a crate transformed into a carriage that takes Ella to the ball. There she meets visiting queen Tatiana, who offers to take Ella around the world as her personal dressmaker. She also meets Princess Gwen, Robert's sister, who is wearing the dress Ella sold him in the market. \nWhen Robert proposes to Ella, she demurs, explaining that marriage will put an end to her dressmaking dreams, which are finally within reach. Robert, whose own lifelong ambition has been to assume the throne, struggles with this answer. At the stroke of midnight, Ella leaves the ball after throwing her shoe at one of the royal attendants, who tries to catch her.\nThe next day, Vivian reveals her own bitter story, trying to make Ella understand that going off to pursue one's personal dreams is incompatible with love and marriage. Vivian sees the remaining glass slipper in Ella's room and realizes she is the mystery girl the prince has been seeking. Vivian tries to convince Ella to marry Robert, but when Ella refuses, Vivian gives her to Thomas.\nWith the help of Queen Beatrice, King Rowan accepts that Robert wishes to marry a commoner, giving him the glass slipper as he searches for Ella. \nElla, having run away from Thomas, is reunited with Robert in a forest, where they profess their love for each other and share a kiss. The pair reach the market in time to show her designs to her benefactor, Tatiana, who accepts them and invites Ella to travel with her.\nRobert introduces Ella to the king and queen, and informs them of their shared decision to travel the world. Though this nullifies his future ascension to the throne, Beatrice smiles as Rowan proudly names Gwen (who has repeatedly shown an interest and ability in affairs of state) first in line to the throne. Citizens of the kingdom gather to witness and celebrate as the royal family officially announce these developments.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nCamila Cabello as Cinderella\nNicholas Galitzine as Prince

Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 42% based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10.
