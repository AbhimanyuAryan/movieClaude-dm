It stars Jeffrey Wright, Ashton Sanders and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.\nIt was released on May 1, 2020, by Netflix.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAn aspiring rapper named Jahkor Lincoln arrives in prison. He ends up serving a life sentence for murder and looks back on the days preceding his arrest and the circumstances of his childhood to find clues to his way forward in life and his survival.\nDuring his childhood, he suffered abuse from his father JD, who was a drug addict and a criminal. His mother Delonda did her best to keep things together. Jahkor ends up turning to petty thefts and assaults with his friend TQ. Jahkor also ended up offering his services to a gangster named Big Stunna, while also having a relationship with a woman named Shantaye with whom he ends up having a son named Zion. Although he tried to lead an honest lifestyle for his son, Jahkor always ended up in trouble.\nJahkor offered to kill Stunna's rival, Malcolm, and he did so by executing Malcolm and his girlfriend Cece in front of their daughter Miesha in their home. It was revealed that as a child, Jahkor saw Malcolm selling his father JD drugs. He asked Malcolm to stop and was rebuffed. He blamed Malcolm for JD's ongoing drug use and the damage to his family. After his arrest, Jahkor learns that TQ and a former associate, T-Rex, were working for Malcolm. Stunna and his girlfriend murder T-Rex while Jahkor kills TQ when he ends up in prison.\nJahkor meets his son when Shantaye brings him along with her and also assures that his son will not end up like him or JD. Jahkor and JD also work on their relationship behind bars.\n\nCast[edit]\nAshton Sanders as Jahkor Abraham Lincoln\nJalyn Emil Hall as young Jahkor\nJeffrey Wright as James Daniel Lincoln \"JD\"\nRegina Taylor as Tommetta\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II as Big Stunna\nChristopher Meyer as Lamark\nAndrea Lynn Ellsworth as Kim\nBaily Hopkins as Ms. Ferguson\nGretchen Klein as Debbie\nAndray Johnson as Mr. Hudson\nStephen Barrington as Malcolm\nRolanda D.
