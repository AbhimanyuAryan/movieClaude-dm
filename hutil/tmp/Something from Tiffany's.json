It is based on the novel of the same name by Melissa Hill.\nSomething from Tiffany's was released on December 9, 2022, by Amazon Studios via Prime Video.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAfter her boyfriend Gary is hit by a car outside a Tiffany's store, Rachel finds a ring box in his belongings and assumes he wants to marry her. However unbeknownst to her, the box belongs to one of the men who performed first aid on him, Ethan.  Meanwhile, Ethan now has the box containing Tiffany earrings which Gary bought. \nRachel invites Ethan to her bakery as a thank-you for helping her boyfriend. The two get on well.  \nAt Christmas, both men present their Tiffany gifts. Ethan realizes the mix-up, but says nothing, because his girlfriend Vanessa likes the earrings. Gary, amnesiac from the accident, thinks he must have bought the ring, so he proposes to Rachel.   \nNext day, Ethan tries to meet Gary to retrieve the ring so he can propose to Vanessa.  He waits with Rachel, but Gary is stuck at work, and Ethan and Rachel end up spending the whole evening together.  \nThe day after, Gary refuses to return the ring.   When Rachel goes to Tiffany's to get advice on how to clean her ring, the saleswoman says she made the sale and describes the man who bought it.  Rachel recognizes Ethan from the description and understands what must have happened.  Confronted by Rachel, Gary claims he knew the ring wasn\u2019t his, but realized he wanted to marry her, so he went through with the proposal -- and he still wants to marry her. Rachel meets Ethan at her bakery and tells him Gary will return the ring.\nOn New Year's Eve, it is revealed that when Rachel met Gary, he was on his way to a hook-up.  She breaks up with him. Ethan and Vanessa simultaneously arrive.  Vanessa is upset to learn that Ethan has been lying to her.  During their argument, they realize they have different plans for the future, and also decide to break up.\nEthan and Rachel meet and kiss, starting a relationship. A year later at Christmas Eve, Ethan proposes to her with the ring she accidentally received a year earlier.\n\nCast[edit]\nZoey Deutch as Rachel Meyer\nKendrick Sampson as Ethan Greene\nRay Nicholson as Gary Wilson\nShay Mitchell as Vanessa\nLeah Jeffries as Daisy Greene\nJojo T.
