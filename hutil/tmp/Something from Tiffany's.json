When Rachel goes to Tiffany's to get advice on how to clean her ring, the saleswoman says she made the sale and describes the man who bought it.  Rachel recognizes Ethan from the description and understands what must have happened.  Confronted by Rachel, Gary claims he knew the ring wasn\u2019t his, but realized he wanted to marry her, so he went through with the proposal -- and he still wants to marry her. Rachel meets Ethan at her bakery and tells him Gary will return the ring.",

Vanessa is upset to learn that Ethan has been lying to her.  During their argument, they realize they have different plans for the future, and also decide to break up.",
