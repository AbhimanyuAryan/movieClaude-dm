    "Plot": [
        "In 1964 England, Estella is a creative child with a talent for fashion, but is ostracized for her black and white hair and develops a nefarious streak. Her mother, Catherine, uses the name \"Cruella\" for her nefarious streak and attempts to encourage her to be nicer. After Estella keeps getting in trouble at school, Catherine decides to move them to London, stopping at a party at Hellman Hall, a mansion on the Suffolk coast to ask the host for money. Sneaking inside, Estella loses her mother's necklace while being chased by the host's Dalmatian dogs, which push Catherine off a cliffside balcony to her death. Orphaned, Estella runs away to London and befriends street urchins Jasper and Horace.",
        "The three become great friends; Estella practices thievery and grifts with Jasper and Horace, honing her fashion skills by designing their disguises, alongside their dogs, Buddy and Wink. For her birthday in 1977, Jasper gets her a job at the Liberty department store, but Estella is made a janitor and denied the chance to use her talents. She drunkenly redecorates the window display and impresses the Baroness\u2014a renowned-but-authoritarian haute couture designer\u2014who offers her a coveted job at her fashion house. Estella gains Baroness's confidence but notices her wearing Catherine's necklace, which Baroness claims is a family heirloom that an employee once stole. Estella asks Jasper and Horace to help retrieve it during Baroness's Black and White Ball, suspecting that Baroness is lying.",
        "To conceal her identity, Estella creates an alter-ego, \"Cruella\", letting her natural hair show rather than wearing her usual wig and wearing one of the Baroness's old designs from a vintage clothing store owned by the flamboyant Artie. At the ball, Cruella steals the spotlight as Jasper and Horace break into Baroness's vault, but they realise that the Baroness is already wearing the necklace. Jasper improvises and releases rats into the party, allowing Estella to swipe the necklace. The Baroness summons her Dalmatians with a dog whistle, and Estella realizes Baroness caused Catherine's death. In the ensuing chaos, a Dalmatian swallows the necklace. Seeking revenge, Estella orders Jasper and Horace to kidnap the Dalmatians, and recovers the necklace. Cruella upstages the Baroness at various events in extravagant fashions, gaining notoriety via society columnist Anita Darling, Estella's childhood friend who has agreed to continue writing articles about her. Furious, Baroness fires her lawyer, Roger Dearly, while Cruella's increasingly haughty behavior discomforts Jasper.",
        "Estella designs and sews an elaborately beaded dress, secretly disguising moth cocoons as beads, as the signature piece for Baroness's spring collection. The night of the spring show, the Baroness opens the vault to find that the collection has been destroyed by the moths. After seeing this, Baroness realizes Estella and Cruella are the same person. Having wrecked Baroness' show, Cruella stages her own rock music fashion show outside in Regent's Park, wearing a faux Dalmatian-fur coat to trick Baroness into thinking she killed her dogs. Returning home, Estella is confronted by Baroness and her men, who have captured Jasper and Horace. Setting fire to the building, Baroness leaves Estella to die, and has Jasper and Horace sent to prison for her murder. Estella is saved by John, Baroness's valet, who reveals that the necklace unlocks a box containing Estella's birth records: Baroness is her biological mother. She had ordered John to murder the infant Estella to focus on her career and keep her husband's inheritance, telling the Baron the baby died; the heartbroken Baron died soon after that. Instead, John gave the baby to Catherine, one of Baroness's maids, who raised Estella in secret.",
        "Cruella breaks Jasper and Horace out of prison and reveals the truth, recruiting them, Artie and John for her final scheme. The quintet sneaks into Baroness's charity gala, having arranged for all the guests to dress as Cruella. On the balcony, Estella confronts her mother, who feigns an embrace before pushing her over the cliff, unwittingly witnessed by her guests. Estella secretly survives with a hidden parachute and, now legally dead, adopts her Cruella persona for good. Baroness is arrested, swearing revenge on Cruella. Before \"dying\", Estella willed her inheritance to Cruella, including the manor which she renames from Hellman Hall to \"Hell Hall\", moving in with her accomplices at the end of the film."

In January 2016, Emma Stone was cast in the titular role of Cruella de Vil. Costume designer Jenny Beavan later stated that her role on the film was to help Stone appear as a younger 1970s portrayal of Close's 1990s role in 101 Dalmatians, possibly confirming the shared continuity between the films, though the characters of Roger and Anita appear as the same age as Cruella and portrayed as different races with different occupations in this film.

        "Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge said: \"The director, who brought a wicked edge to pop-culture redux I, Tonya a few years back, has rescued Cruella from the predictability of the earlier 101 Dalmatians remakes and created a stylish new franchise of its own in which a one-time villain has been reborn as the unlikeliest of role models.\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"easy enough to watch but hard to care much about,\" complimenting the film's visual style while also finding that \"[the film's] main purpose is to remind you that other movies exist.\" Peter Travers, reviewing the film for ABC News, wrote: \"If looks really were everything, Cruella would be flying high on the dazzling costumes that two-time Oscar winner Jenny Beavan has designed for star Emma Stone to swan around in as this iconic villain of page and screen. But looks alone won't cut it when the plot points are so hit and miss.\" Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times remarked the movie as \"dazzling fun\" and lauded the performances of Stone and Thompson, of which he described the rivalry of the performances as \"hard to resist on-screen\", and hailed Beavan's costume design on the film as one of her best works since Mad Max: Fury Road, while drawing parallels of the film's moral ambiguities and Stone's portrayal of the titular character to her previous performance as Abigail Hill in The Favourite.",
        "Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote: \"Placing these characters in the '60s and '70s allows director Craig Gillespie and screenwriters Dana Fox and Tony McNamara to place the characters into an exciting moment of fashion history\u00a0... Costumer Jenny Beavan, art director Martin Foley, and production designer Fiona Crombie, and their respective departments, all seem to be enjoying and making the most of the film's period demands.\" In addition, Duralde also lauded the performances of Stone, Hauser, and Thompson, drawing comparisons of the characterizations of the latter's portrayal of the Baroness to Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada and Reynolds Woodcock in Phantom Thread. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film four out of five stars, describing it as \"entertaining\" and an \"outrageous punk\", as well as praising the performances and dynamic between Stone and Thompson. Furthermore, Bradshaw also complimented the tone of the film's soundtrack to Michael Jackson and similarly praised the film's mid-70s costume and production designs of Beavan and Crombie as \"top-notch\". Chicago Sun-Times's Richard Roeper rated the film with 3/4 stars, and highlighted Gillespie's direction for being \"clever\" and \"devilishly offbeat\" while praising the performances of Stone and Thompson as \"appropriately over-the-top and wildly entertaining\", drawing its comparisons to The Devil Wears Prada and also commended the costumes, makeup, and the production values of which he referred to as \"spectacular\", \"dazzling\" and a \"visual feast\", comparing its style to Phantom Thread and noting the similarities of the vibe and tone of the film's soundtrack to Goodfellas, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and Baby Driver.",
        "The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin scored the film four out of five, similarly praised the film, which he described as a \"rollicking tale\" and an \"acid-tipped wackiness\", and lauded the film for its different approach in the Disney live-action adaptations as well as the previous 101 Dalmatians versions and its interpretation of the central character in a new context. He also similarly praised the performances (particularly Stone and Thompson) as well as the supporting cast, which he referred to as \"zany\", while specifically remarking of Stone's performance of Cruella De Vil as \"sharp-angled, hyper-expressive\" and that Thompson's portrayal of the Baroness \"stalks the fine line between threatening and ludicrous with stiletto-heel precision\". In addition, Collin also praised the film's visual style and Beavan's costume design as \"eyeball-popping\" and \"a garden-hose-blast to the eyeballs of pure sartorial flair and exuberance\". K. Austin Collins of Rolling Stone  rated the film with three out of five stars, praising Stone's success in embodying the titular character, and describing her performance as \"vampy, stylish, and cruel\" while comparing the film's style of storytelling to I, Tonya, of which he noted a similar internalized victim-like story perspective of Tonya Harding to Cruella de Vil and even pointed out on the similar \"plausibly two-sided\" depiction of Stone's Cruella to Andrea \"Andy\" Sachs from The Devil Wears Prada, but with a twisted spin. He also commended the supporting performances, particularly Thompson and Hauser, referring the film as \"a battle of wits and knits\", \"entertaining\", and \"fun\". Jamie Jirak from ComicBook.com called the film as \"raising the bar when it comes to their [Disney's] live-action catalog\", praising the art department, the performances and nostalgic elements. Debopriyaa Dutta from Screen Rant opined that the film told a \"masterfully nuanced origin\" and praised the performances of Stone and Hauser. The Hollywood Outsider's Morgan Lanier described the film as \"taking place in the 70's with a lot of camp to lighten the mood\", praising Stone for giving Cruella  \"a twist of vulnerability\" and giving the longstanding Disney villain a \"fun glimmer\". Lanier also praised Thompson's performance saying \"Thompson gives the baroness the ability to chill a room\". Lanier concluded that the movie was \"joyous, campy, great costumes, [\u2026] amplified by a killer soundtrack\". Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \"B\u2212\", and labelling the film as \"exciting\" and \"fun\" and a \"colorful, loud, and unexpected look\" on the origin story of Cruella De Vil while Erbland singled out the praises on the casting and the performances of Stone, Thompson, Fry, Hauser, and the costumes, but found fault at the film's runtime of which she referred it as \"bloated\".",
        "The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday described the film as \"tedious, transgressive, chaotic and inert\". While praising the performances of Stone, Thompson, Fry, and Hauser, as well as the costumes; she criticized the film, writing, and the runtime of which she found it as \"overstuffed\", \"overlong\", and \"miserably misanthropic\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle thought the film was misbegotten and felt that it favors more on style over substance. Though he praised Thompson's performance, the costume design and the soundtrack, he chided the film's writing as \"lazy\" and \"careless\". Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2/4 stars, and said: \"There's no denying that Cruella is stylish and kinetic, with a nasty edge that's unusual for a recent Disney live-action feature. But it's also exhausting, disorganized, and frustratingly inert, considering how hard it works to assure you that it's thrilling and cheeky.\" Jacobin's Eileen Jones labelled the film as a \"dopey, uninspired, and tedious mess\", specifically criticizing the script as \"basically rotten\" and describing the transformation of Cruella's character as \"the complete mangling of one of the greatest Disney villains of all time.\" Jones took issue with the absence of the \"implied critique [...] of Cruella's wealthy entitlement and mad consumer obsession\" as shown in 101 Dalmatians, and the attempt to make a \"legendary dalmatian-skinning villain\" into a \"scrappy, likable hero.\" Jones complimented the film's costume design, specifically emphasizing the \"trash gown\" shown at the Baroness fashion show, and describing it as \"sufficiently cool that costume designer Jenny Beavan may win another Oscar.\""
