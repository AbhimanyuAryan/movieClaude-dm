        "On aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 20% approval rating based on 5 critical reviews and an critic score rating of 3.7/10 on IMDb. According to a review by Mike McGranaghan of Aisle Seat; \"Strictly Confidential has a screenplay that sounds like it was written by an AI program that was taught every cheesy, straight-to-cable erotic thriller from the early \u201890s.\" Avi Offer of NYC Movie Guru states; \"A clunky, convoluted and preposterous mess with enough unintentional laughs to make it a guilty pleasure. Strictly Confidential is like an erotic version of Knives Out without the comedy, suspense or Benoit Blanc.\" Stephen Holland of Screen Rant; \"First-time director Damian Hurley delivers a disappointing erotic thriller full of predictable twists, an illogical plot, and stilted scenes.\" Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com; \"Hurley doesn\u2019t push the picture\u2019s sauciness and he\u2019s mostly fatigued when it comes to blowing minds, but \u201cStrictly Confidential\u201d does have the novelty of a son exploiting the sex appeal of his mom for the benefit of an otherwise uninteresting whodunit.\""
