        "Lincoln Loud, the middle child and only son of Lynn Loud Sr. and Rita Loud, spends his time assisting his sisters\u2014Lori, Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, Lana, Lola and Lisa\u2014as they go about their day-to-day duties, while also teaching his youngest sister Lily how to cope with living in a large family. After a particularly successful day in which the sisters all win awards, they celebrate at Lynn Sr.'s restaurant. There, the Loud sisters are praised by fans while Lincoln is pushed to the side and ignored. Feeling that he is living in their shadows, he consults his friend Clyde McBride, who tells him about the time he learnt his grandmother's side of the family was from Paris.",
        "Inspired, Lincoln asks his parents the same question and Lisa manages to trace Lynn Sr.'s heritage to Scotland. The Loud family then heads to Scotland for a week-long vacation on a hectic trip involving parachuting from a cargo hold, flying in a hot air balloon, and traveling in a submarine. Upon arriving in the Scottish town of Loch Loud, a town filled with many oddities, the Loud family learns from a boy named Scott\u2014who Leni falls in love with\u2014and Loch Loud's citizens that they are descendants of Scottish royalty. They are led to a castle ran by groundskeeper Angus and the disgruntled property caretaker Morag.",
        "Angus then shows the family members a painting of their ancestors that bears a striking resemblance to them and reveals they ruled the town for many years before sailing away forever. Lincoln eventually learns from Angus that his own ancestral counterpart, the Duke of the family, was the most special member of the family, much to his delight. Wanting to become the new Duke of Loch Loud, Lincoln partakes in many community service events to help restore the village to its former glory and eventually guilt-trips the rest of the family into moving to Scotland forever because they no longer have to share one bathroom. A bad service call from Lori causes Bobby to think they are breaking up.",
        "As the Louds adjust to their discovery while experiencing the ghost of their descendant Lucille Loud, a baby dragon who grows very fast whenever she eats that they name Lela, and enjoying their time in the castle, Morag becomes frustrated with the family after living in the castle peacefully and quietly for many years. She then devises a plan like her ancestor Aggie to get the family to leave Loch Loud forever by hypnotizing Lela with a magic gemstone known as the Dragon Stone and the royal scepter.",
        "After the sisters begin to get attention in the village, Morag tricks Lincoln into riding Lela to try to get back his attention. While he rides the dragon, she uses the gemstone and scepter to hypnotize it into destroying the town so Lincoln would be blamed for the chaos. Feeling guilty for the damage, Lincoln asks the family to return home to Royal Woods. As the family leaves for home, Morag proceeds to make herself the new duchess of the town much to the displeasure of villagers. In retaliation, she hypnotizes Lela again to cause more destruction to the village.",
        "Lucille tells the family of Morag's plan and what she's doing to the town. The Loud children head back to the town on a rowboat and team up to defeat Morag and un-hypnotize Lela. The sisters eventually get the scepter back and Lincoln, using his magic skills and with help from Lily, destroys the Dragon Stone, which breaks Lela out of her spell. In response, Lela drops Morag on an island filled with noisy seals. The citizens of Loch Loud congratulate the family and ask Lincoln to resume his place as the duke of the kingdom, though Lincoln declines and instead offers the crown to Angus instead, feeling he deserves it more. This decision is approved by the citizens and the other ghosts of the Loud ancestors.",
        "After helping repair the village, the Loud family says goodbye to Angus and the villagers and sets sail back home to Royal Woods. Bobby arrives to reunite with Lori only to find that she left. Clyde welcomes Lincoln back to Royal Woods with some duke-themed cream puffs.",
        "During the credits, still images are shown that include but are not limited to the Duke's ghost riding Lela, Bobby reuniting with Lori, Leni contacting Scott online, Lincoln winning a 3rd place trophy at a magic show, Lela having laid three eggs, and Angus and the ghosts rescuing Morag who now works as the groundskeeper with Lela keeping her in line."

Dave Needham later contradicted Savino's claim stating that it is canon since Lily is still in her diaper appearance. In a later interview on the Nerds Social Club Podcast, Needham states that this film takes place during the summer somewhere between \"Coupe Dreams\" and \"Schooled!\"",
        "Savino had no involvement on the film after being fired from the show due to sexual harassment allegations back in October 2017. In January 2021, it was announced that the film would be part of Netflix's 2021 film lineup. The film's cast and crew were revealed in April 2021, confirming the entire main cast will be reprising their roles from the show, including new members such as David Tennant, Billy Boyd, and Michelle Gomez.",

    "Reception": [
        "The Loud House Movie was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics. Bob Hoose from Focus on the Family's pluggedin.com gave a positive review for the movie saying that \"The Loud House Movie is a nicely balanced musical that somehow gives all of the kids\u2014with their distinctive personalities and quirks\u2014a moment to shine. All the while, it also delivers a rollicking, giggle-packed tale of castles, dragons and backstabbing caretakers\". Common Sense Media's review published on The Washington Post noted that parents should \"expect some name-calling like 'loser' and 'stinkin' Lincoln',\" but noted that, \"overall this is a funny, heartwarming story that the whole family can enjoy\"."
