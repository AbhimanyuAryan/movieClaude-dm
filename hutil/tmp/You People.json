The film features an ensemble cast that includes Hill, Lauren London, David Duchovny, Nia Long, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Eddie Murphy. Its plot focuses on an interracial and interreligious couple, namely a Secular Jewish man and a Black nationalist NOI woman, and how their families reckon with modern love amid culture clashes, societal expectations and generational differences. Set in the Los Angeles area, the two Millennials meet by chance and go into uncharted waters in their dating lives.\nYou People was released in select theaters on January 20, 2023, before its Netflix streaming release on January 27. It was the first time Barris directed a feature film. The film received mixed reviews from critics and stirred questions of antisemitism.[1][2]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nEzra Cohen, a thirty-five-year-old finance broker and pop culture podcaster, falls into an unlikely relationship with stylist Amira Mohammed. The couple first meet in a meet cute when Amira, frustrated with her GPS navigation system, parks in front of Ezra's work building. He mistakenly believing Amira is his Uber driver, so climbs into the car, setting off an awkward dust-up. \nEzra makes amends by later taking her out to lunch, and they realize there is a mutual attraction despite their differences, as Ezra is Jewish, and Amira is Black and the daughter of devout followers of the Nation of Islam.\nAmira and Ezra eventually move in together, to her father Akbar's chagrin who'd prefer his daughter date another Nation of Islam member. Six months into their relationship, Ezra takes her to meet his family. His rich, progressive Limousine liberal parents Shelley and Arnold patronizingy explain that they are accepting and supportive of everyone, mentioning their lesbian daughter Liza. When Shelley begins to bring up the BLM movement, an embarrassed Ezra steers her out of the room. He confides to her that he plans on proposing. \nBefore he can propose, Ezra is urged by his friend and fellow podcast host Mo to meet with Amira's parents. Ezra chooses a Roscoe\u2019s Chicken \u2018N Waffles restaurant to talk with Akbar and his wife, Fatima. The meeting does not go smoothly, as Akbar views Ezra with suspicion and shows resistance to his wish to marry Amira. \nWhen Amira comes home, she tells Ezra that her mother let her know about their awkward meeting at Roscoe\u2019s. However, when he begins to pull out a ring box, she urges him to go ahead with the proposal and happily accepts.\nEzra decides to quit his job at the brokerage firm to fully pursue his passion for podcasting. Later, the couple invite both sets of parents over for dinner and to discuss wedding plans. The dinner unsurprisingly goes awry, with the parents clashing over Farrakhan's antisemitic views and Shelley inadvertently setting Akbar\u2019s kufi on fire. \nEzra and Amira arrange mutual one-on-one time with their future in-laws to help smooth over tensions. Ezra spends the day with Akbar, but Akbar constantly undermines Ezra\u2019s self-confidence, from criticizing him for quitting finance for podcasting to taking him to a barbershop where Ezra fails to conform to the dress code. He later takes him to a basketball court in mostly Black Inglewood, and urges him to join a pickup game to humiliate him. Akbar films him with his phone, but is surprised that Ezra does very well. Meanwhile, Shelley takes Amira out for a spa day, but she continually shows her cluelessness, makes Amira uncomfortable, and is oblivious to her many violations of unwritten social rules of Black culture.\nFor his bachelor party, Ezra heads to Las Vegas with his friends, but Akbar unexpectedly joins the boys. Knowing he\u2019s being watched, Ezra does not take part in the festivities. However, his friends loudly reminisce about the hedonistic acts Ezra committed on previous trips to Vegas. At her bachelorette party in Palm Springs, Amira and her friends are joined by Shelley and Liza. The night suffers from more embarrassments, with Shelley inadvertently making a racist remark during a party game and accidentally ripping off a guest\u2019s wig.\nAt the rehearsal dinner, both Ezra and Amira speak privately to Akbar and Shelley, with Ezra calling out Akbar\u2019s distrust of his genuine love for Amira, and Amira confronting Shelley about her tone-deaf statements and patronizing behavior. After their mutual talks, Ezra and Amira decide that their union has too many obstacles to overcome. They call off the wedding and break up. \nThree months later, Ezra gives a heartbroken soliloquy over his podcast, saying that black and white people can never truly understand the other's culture or experience, no matter how deeply they love each other or hard they try. Both Shelley and Akbar are deeply moved to hear his speech. Akbar, who is particularly cut to the quick, is inspired to contact Shelley. \nOn the pretext of a shopping excursion, Shelley and Akbar take Ezra and Amira to a trendy boutique and both apologize for their actions. Akbar promises to accept Ezra into the family. Shelley promises to get to know Amira as a human being, rather than as a trophy to show off to other Limousine Liberals. Ezra and Amira accept their apologies and enter the retail store to find it set up for their wedding, with everyone including friends, family, and a rabbi and NOI minister assembled. Ezra and Amira marry and both families celebrate.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJonah Hill as Ezra\nLauren London as Amira\nDavid Duchovny as Arnold\nNia Long as Fatima\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Shelley\nEddie Murphy as Akbar\nSam Jay as Mo\nTravis Bennett as Omar\nMolly Gordon as Liza\nDeon Cole as Demetrius\nAndrea Savage as Becca\nElliott Gould as Mr. Greenbaum\nRhea Perlman as Bubby\nMike Epps as Uncle EJ\nLa La Anthony as Shaela\nYung Miami as Tiffany\nKhadijah Haqq as Renee\nBryan Greenberg as Issac\nJordan Firstman as Danny\nAndrew Schulz as Cousin Avi\nMatt Walsh as Don Wood\nEmily Arlook as Kim Glassman\nHal Linden as Mr. Greenwald\nWinnie Holzman as Mrs. Greenwald\nRichard Benjamin as Dr. Green\nDoug Hall as Chris\nAnthony Anderson as Barber #1\nNelson Franklin as Director\nRob Huebel as Producer\nKym Whitley as Aunt Nadine\nKenya Barris as Airplane Passenger\nFelipe Esparza as Zminski\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2021, it was reported that Jonah Hill would star in a Netflix comedy film directed by Kenya Barris from a script written by Hill and Barris.[3] In August 2021, it was announced that Eddie Murphy would star in the film.[4] In September 2021, Julia Louis-Dreyfus,[5] Lauren London, Sam Jay, and Molly Gordon joined the cast.[6] In October 2021, more cast members joined the film, including David Duchovny, Nia Long,[7] Travis Bennett, Andrea Savage, Rhea Perlman, La La Anthony, and Deon Cole.[8] In November 2021, Emily Arlook, Bryan Greenberg, Andrew Schulz, and Jordan Firstman joined the cast.[9]\nFilming began in October 2021 in Los Angeles.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nYou People was released in select theaters on January 20, 2023.[11] It was released on January 27, 2023, by Netflix.[12]\nIn its first week, the film debuted at number one on the Netflix English-language Top 10 list, being streamed for 55.65 million hours.[13] Between its release and June 2023 the film totaled 181.8 million hours watched (equal to 92.4 million views).[14]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 132 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"You People has an outstanding cast and plenty of comedic potential\u2014both mostly wasted on a picture that dithers between social commentary and romantic comedy without fully committing to either.\"[15] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[16]\nPete Hammond of Deadline called it \"brilliantly hilarious, pertinent and wickedly smart.\"[11] Christian Zilko of Indiewire graded the film a B+ and concluded that it \"ends up being more of a feel-good rom-com and love letter to Los Angeles than a truly biting satire.\"[17] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that it \"sinks under the weight of its obviousness and a consistently heavy-handed approach, despite the sometimes stylish and well-paced direction from Kenya Barris and an incredibly talented cast.\"[18]  Meanwhile Allisson Josephs of Jew in the City identified a number of traditional antisemitic tropes recycled by the film, going so far as to claim that \"Kenya Barris is clearly a [Louis] Farrakhan fan.\"[19] Mira Fox of The Forward also criticised the film for ignoring the concept of Jews as an ethnic minority in their own right, as well as openly furthering the antisemitic conspiracy theory that \"Jews are so wealthy now...from controlling the slave trade. This is a conspiracy theory that's growing in strength, yet the movie does nothing to debunk it\".[20]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The phrase \"you people\" has casual connotations in modern English. It is used by the speaker to refer to a group considered separate, to which the person does not belong.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Blum, Brian (February 11, 2023). \"The antisemitism of Netflix's You People\".
