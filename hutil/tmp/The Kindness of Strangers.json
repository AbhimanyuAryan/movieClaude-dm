Having endured an abusive marriage to her husband Richard, a police officer, Clara flees to New York City, taking Anthony and Jude with her under the guise of a \"vacation\"\nIn New York, Clara and the boys struggle with homelessness, often driving around in their car or relying on shoplifting to survive on the streets. They are eventually taken in by a nurse, Alice, who runs a local church and support group. Alice is a vocal supporter of homeless people, having befriended a boy named Jeff who had been fired from various employments before being evicted from his apartment.\nDuring the night, a disoriented Jude collapses in the middle of a snowstorm storm, forcing him to be hospitalized. Clara is later taken in by ex-convict Marc, whom Anthony is hostile towards but eventually warms up to him. As it turns out, Anthony had uncovered a series of explicit crimes against women committed by Richard on his computer. With Marc's help, Clara hires a lawyer and Marc's friend John Peter to incriminate Richard. Meanwhile, Richard beats his father with a phone when he refuses to help him. Richard is later found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.\nDespite having finally returned home, Jude's relationship with his mother is strained due to their time on the streets but eventually forgives her. As the film ends, Jeff is able to secure a job at a restaurant run by Marc's employer Timofrey.\n\nCast[edit]\nZoe Kazan as Clara Scott\nTahar Rahim as Marc\nEsben Smed as Richard Scott\nAndrea Riseborough as Alice\nCaleb Landry Jones as Jeff\nBill Nighy as Timofey\nJay Baruchel as John Peter\nJack Fulton as Anthony Scott\nFinlay Wojtak-Hissong as Jude Scott\nNicolaj Kopernikus as Sergei\nRodrigo Fernandez-Stoll as Laundry Worker #1\nProduction[edit]\nIn February 2017, it was announced Lone Scherfig would direct the film, from a screenplay she wrote, with HanWay Films, Ingenious Media, Apollo Media, Creative Alliance, Strada Films, Telefilm Canada, Danish Film Institute, Nadcon,  D'Artaganan, and Entertainment One serving as producers.[3][4] In February 2018, Andrea Riseborough, Tahar Rahim, and Zoe Kazan joined the cast of the film.[5] In March 2018, Bill Nighy, Caleb Landry Jones, and Jay Baruchel joined the cast of the film.[6] In September 2018, it was announced the title was The Kindness of Strangers.[7]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in March 2018, and took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, New York City, and Copenhagen, Denmark.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 7, 2019.[9] It was released in the United States on February 14, 2020, by Vertical Entertainment.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nAccording to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 31% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10.
