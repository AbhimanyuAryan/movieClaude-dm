It is based upon Ben Macintyre's book on the British Operation Mincemeat during the Second World War. The film stars Colin Firth, Kelly Macdonald, Matthew Macfadyen, Penelope Wilton, Johnny Flynn and Jason Isaacs. This was Paul Ritter's final film appearance, and was dedicated to his memory.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2021 British Film Festival in Australia, and was released in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2022 by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was released on Netflix in North American and South American countries on 11 May 2022.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1943, the United Kingdom is entrenched in World War II. Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, a Jewish barrister, remains in England while his wife Iris and their children travel to safety in the United States. Montagu takes a break from practising law when he is appointed to the Twenty Committee. His secretary, Hester Leggett, comes with him.\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill has promised the US that the Allies will invade Sicily by July of that year in order to push further north. However, Sicily is considered an obvious target and may be defended by the Wehrmacht. Admiral Godfrey thinks that Britain must trick Nazi Germany into believing the Allies will invade Greece. Charles Cholmondeley proposes an operation from the Trout Memo, which would entail a corpse carrying false secrets washing ashore. Despite Godfrey's doubts, he gives Montagu and Cholmondeley permission to plan the operation with Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming.\nMontagu and Cholmondeley obtain the body of a vagrant named Glyndwr Michael, who died by possible suicidal poisoning. He is given the false identity of Major William Martin, Royal Marines, with a detailed backstory and ID photos. A widowed secretary in the office, Jean Leslie, offers a photo of herself to serve as Martin's fake fianc\u00e9e, \"Pam\". The team fabricate items for Martin to carry in his pockets, including theatre tickets, personal bills and a love letter from \"Pam\" written by Hester. Cholmondeley has a crush on Jean, but soon realises that Montagu and Jean share romantic feelings. This causes Cholmondeley to grow jealous and occasionally lash out at Montagu. Complications ensue when Michael's sister arrives to claim his body, but she is turned away by Montagu and Cholmondeley.\nGodfrey suspects Montagu's brother, Ivor, is a spy for the USSR. He bribes Cholmondeley to spy on Montagu and, in return, Godfrey will locate and return the remains of Cholmondeley's brother, who was killed in action in Chittagong, Bengal. Cholmondeley reluctantly agrees.\nSpecialist MI5 driver St John \"Jock\" Horsfall transports Montagu, Cholmondeley and the corpse to the submarine base at Holy Loch. The corpse is then loaded onto the submarine HMS Seraph. On 30 April, the Seraph arrives in the Gulf of C\u00e1diz and drops the corpse into the ocean. It is found by fishermen in Huelva, Spain. Operation Mincemeat staff attempt to get the fake documents to Madrid. However, the mission is hampered by bad luck, as the Spanish have resisted Nazi influence more than expected. Captain David Ainsworth, the British naval attach\u00e9 in Madrid, meets with Colonel Cerruti of the Spanish secret police in one last attempt to get the papers to the Germans. When Martin's personal items are returned to London, a specialist works out that the documents have been tampered with. This gives Operation Mincemeat staff hope that Germany retrieved the false information.\nJean is threatened by Teddy, a waiter at a club the team has frequented, claiming to be a spy for an anti-Hitler plot within Germany. She tells him that Major Martin was travelling under an alias but the classified information was genuine. After Teddy leaves, Jean informs Montagu and Cholmondeley. They come to believe that Colonel Alexis von Roenne, who controls intelligence in the German Army High Command, sent Teddy to verify information so von Roenne could undermine Hitler. However, they have no way of being sure. Montagu takes Jean to his home for protection, but she accepts a job in Special Operations and soon leaves London.\nOn 10 July, the Allied invasion of Sicily begins. News arrives that the Allies suffered limited casualties, the enemy is retreating, and the beaches have been held. Afterwards, Cholmondeley admits he received his brother's remains in return for spying on Montagu. Feeling sympathetic and relieved that Operation Mincemeat was a success, Montagu offers to buy Cholmondeley a drink even though it is eight in the morning.\nThe epilogue says that Montagu reunited with Iris after the war, Jean married a soldier, Hester continued as Director of the Admiralty Secretarial Unit, and Cholmondeley remained with MI5 until 1952, later married, and travelled widely. Major William Martin's identity was revealed to be Glyndwr Michael in 1997 when an epitaph, with his real name, was added to Martin's headstone in Spain.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nColin Firth as Ewen Montagu\nMatthew Macfadyen as Charles Cholmondeley\nKelly Macdonald as Jean Leslie\nPenelope Wilton as Hester Leggett\nJohnny Flynn as Ian Fleming\nJason Isaacs as Admiral John Godfrey\nMark Gatiss as Ivor Montagu\nHattie Morahan as Iris Montagu\nMark Bonnar as Jock Horsfall\nPaul Ritter as Bentley Purchase\nAlex Jennings as John Masterman\nSimon Russell Beale as Winston Churchill\nJames Fleet as Charles Fraser-Smith\nNicholas Rowe as Capt David Ainsworth\nWill Keen as Salvador Gomez-Beare\nCharlotte Hamblin as Patricia Trehearne\nLorne MacFadyen as Sgt Roger Dearborn (and) Glyndwr Michael\nRufus Wright as Lt Bill Jewell\nJonjo O'Neill as Teddy\nRuby Bentall as Connie Bukes\nEllie Haddington as Hilda Georgina Cholmondeley\nIn addition, other notable historical figures are briefly included in the film, with Alexander Beyer as Karl Kuhlenthal, Nico Birnbaum as Colonel Alexis von Roenne and  Pep Tosar as Admiral Moreno.\n\nProduction[edit]\nIt was announced in May 2019 that the film would be directed by John Madden, and Colin Firth would star.[3] Kelly Macdonald joined the film in October.[4] In December, Matthew Macfadyen, Penelope Wilton, Johnny Flynn, Tom Wilkinson, Hattie Morahan, Simon Russell Beale, Paul Ritter and Mark Gatiss were added to the cast.[5] Jason Isaacs was announced as part of the cast in March 2020.[6]\nPrincipal photography began in December 2019 between London and Spain.[7]\nFilming locations include a battle scene at Saunton Beach in North Devon in February 2020 and a scene in M\u00e1laga in March 2021.[8]\n\nHistoricity[edit]\nAlthough the main thrust of the film is historically accurate, the filmmakers made some omissions and additions that were not in MacIntyre's book, including the creation of a fictional sub-plot involving a love triangle between Montagu, Cholmondeley and Leslie.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn February 2021, Warner Bros. International acquired the distribution rights to the film in the UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Benelux.[10] The film had its world premiere at the 2021 British Film Festival in Australia,[11] and was released in cinemas on 15 April 2022.[12] Netflix purchased the rights to the film in North and Latin America, and it was released on the streaming service in those territories on 11 May 2022.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 113 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"If its fact-based story proves more fascinatingly outlandish than it's presented here, Operation Mincemeat remains an engaging and well-acted wartime drama.\"[13] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[14]\n\nSee also[edit]\nThe Man Who Never Was, 1956 film based on Ewen Montagu's book of the same name about Operation Mincemeat\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Operation Mincemat (2022) - Financial Information\".
