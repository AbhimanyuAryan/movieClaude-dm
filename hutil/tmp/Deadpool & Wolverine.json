        "Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool:A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation to treat terminal cancer. Writer Rhett Reese described the film as a fish out of water story for Deadpool, who is a lunatic dropped into the \"very sane world\" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Reynolds is also expected to portray a \"samurai-based\" variant of the character.",
        "Hugh Jackman as James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine:A mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an adamantium-infused skeleton. Jackman described Logan and Deadpool as opposites with a \"quarreling dynamic\" that would frustrate Logan. To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine which included eating up to 8,000 calories a day. Jackman also appears as the character's alter ego, Patch.",
        "Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova: A mutant with telekinetic and telepathic powers who is the twin sister of Charles Xavier",
        "Morena Baccarin as Vanessa: Wilson's fianc\u00e9e. Baccarin believed the film would further reinvent Vanessa's relationship with Wilson while maintaining a core element that keeps them together.",
        "Rob Delaney as Peter: A member of Wilson's X-Force team",
        "Leslie Uggams as Blind Al: Wilson's blind elderly roommate",

    "Production": [
        "After the success of Deadpool (2016), 20th Century Fox began developing two sequels. The third film was set to include the superhero team X-Force. Deadpool director Tim Miller chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star Ryan Reynolds, and David Leitch was hired to direct Deadpool 2 (2018) in November 2016. Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film. In March 2017, Deadpool and Deadpool 2 co-writer Rhett Reese said X-Force would be introduced in Deadpool 2 and then featured in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third Deadpool film which would be more personal.",
        "When the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Reynolds's Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) despite those films being rated PG-13 and the Deadpool films being R-rated. Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated Deadpool films \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\", and suggested that a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool. In May 2018, Reynolds said a third Deadpool film may not be made given the franchise's shift of focus to X-Force, but Reese and his writing partner Paul Wernick felt a third film would absolutely happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released. They compared this to the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012) being released between Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013). Leitch expressed interest in returning for another Deadpool film, depending on the schedule. A third Deadpool film was believed to be in active development by August 2018, with production planned to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, rather than in Vancouver, Canada, where the previous films were made. Once Upon a Deadpool, a PG-13 version of Deadpool 2, was released at the end of the year. It was watched carefully by Disney and Marvel Studios to see how it might inform their approach to the character in the MCU. While promoting Once Upon a Deadpool, Reynolds confirmed that a third Deadpool film was in development and said it would go in a \"completely different direction\"; Reynolds later revealed that they were planning a road trip film styled after Rashomon (1950) featuring Hugh Jackman's X-Men character James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine. Jackman had himself envisioned a team-up film with Reynolds inspired by 48 Hrs. (1982) while attending a screening of Deadpool in 2016, despite formally retiring from the role of Wolverine at that time. In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for Marvel Studios, including Deadpool and the X-Men. The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".",
        "Josh Brolin revealed in June 2019 that he had discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios several times after starring as that character in Deadpool 2. Brolin also portrayed Thanos in the MCU. In October, Zazie Beetz said she would be surprised if she did not reprise her Deadpool 2 role of Domino in a future film. That month, Reese and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a \"much-needed rest from Deadpool\" while they waited to hear from Marvel Studios about the future of the franchise. They confirmed that another Deadpool film would be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character with the MCU. Wernick stated that there was never a set pitch for a third Deadpool film between their exhaustion following the completion of Deadpool 2 and the announcement of Fox's acquisition by Disney, with Reese adding that they now had to \"land on the right idea and once we do, I think we'll be off to the races\". The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films. At that time, Reynolds revealed that he was meeting with Marvel Studios. In December, Reynolds confirmed that he and \"the whole team\" were actively developing a Deadpool film at Marvel Studios. During his meetings with the studio, Reynolds urged Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige to include Wolverine in the film but was told that this would not be possible.",
        "Throughout October 2020, Reynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers for the next Deadpool film. Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios felt the writers' pitch was in line with their intentions for the film, which would remain R-rated. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and was not involved in hiring the writers. Leitch later confirmed that he had met with Marvel for the film, but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning. In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would have an R rating and would be set in the MCU. Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin until after 2021 due to Reynolds's busy schedule. He said Deadpool was a very different type of character to have in the MCU. That July, Reynolds and Taika Waititi promoted their film Free Guy (2021) by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi's MCU character Korg, respectively, in a commercial for that film titled Deadpool and Korg React. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall and discusses joining the MCU with Korg in the commercial. The next month, Reynolds said he expected filming to begin in 2022, which Feige soon confirmed. Feige added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film. In November, Beetz and Rob Delaney expressed interest in returning as their Deadpool 2 characters Domino and Peter, but Beetz ultimately did not return for the third film. Also in November, Reynolds said they were \"plugging away\" at the film.",
        "Shawn Levy was revealed to be directing the film in March 2022, having previously directed Reynolds in Free Guy and The Adam Project (2022). Levy said filming would not begin until after 2022 due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year. At the same time, Reynolds confirmed that his production company Maximum Effort would co-produce the film, and Reese and Wernick were hired to rewrite the screenplay. The pair said in June that they were excited to use elements of the MCU as a backdrop for the film, and said Disney and Marvel were supportive of the jokes about the MCU they were writing for Deadpool given the success of the previous films. They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch on the script or just reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters and said answering this question could divulge plot details. Also in June, Raymond Chan was revealed to be the production designer after previously working on the Disney+ MCU television series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021). Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series, such as Captain America: Civil War (2016), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018). He added that it was fun to be working with Reynolds.",
        "After being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, Jackman had a change of heart in mid-August 2022 and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I'll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I've ever done\". He contacted Reynolds about joining the film at the same time that Reynolds was preparing to have a meeting with Feige. Reynolds had continued to entertain the idea himself over the years. He announced in September that Jackman would return as Wolverine for Deadpool 3, which was set for release on September 6, 2024. Reynolds and Jackman soon clarified that the film would not interfere with the events of Logan (2017), in which Wolverine dies, and would take place before that film. This was important to Jackman, who said the character's return would use a narrative device from Marvel Studios that allowed characters to move around timelines. He reached out to Logan director James Mangold to inform him of the film's story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that Logan would not be interfered with.",
        "Pre-production work had begun by October 2022, when filming was expected to begin in January 2023 in Vancouver, before the film's release date was pushed back to November 8, 2024. Jackman indicated that the film may not be titled Deadpool 3; Reynolds soon referred to it as \"The Deadpool/Wolverine film\", and Jackman later referred to it as Wolverine and Deadpool. Reynolds said in November that filming would begin just before mid-2023, and Levy confirmed in December that filming was set to begin in May 2023. He said developing the film was one of the most fun creative experiences of his career, citing the film's self-awareness, violence, and foul language. Levy said he did not want to alter the franchise's DNA from the prior films and called the film \"raw, audacious, [and] very much R-rated\", comparing it to Midnight Run (1988), 48 Hrs., and Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987). By February 2023, Patrick Stewart, who portrayed Charles Xavier in the X-Men film series and reprised the role in the MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), had been approached to potentially make an appearance in the film. Later that month, Emma Corrin joined the cast in a lead villain role. Marvel had been considering Corrin for the role since late 2022, but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on. Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of Virginia Woolf's Orlando. Corrin was excited to play a villain in the film as they had not played many villainous roles before. Levy was revealed to be producing the film alongside Feige and Reynolds, through his production company 21 Laps Entertainment, and filming was set to take place in London. X-Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner was also a producer for the film, while Simon Kinberg served as an executive producer after producing the previous Deadpool films and some of the X-Men films. Kinberg said the film's creative team cared deeply about Logan, Deadpool, and Wolverine, and said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige.",
        "In March 2023, Jeff Sneider of Above the Line reported that the Time Variance Authority (TVA), Mobius M. Mobius (portrayed by Owen Wilson), and Miss Minutes (voiced by Tara Strong) from the MCU television series Loki (2021\u20132023) would be featured in the film. Later that month, Matthew Macfadyen joined the cast in an undisclosed role, which was described as a \"third wheel\" to Deadpool and Wolverine. Karan Soni and Leslie Uggams were set to reprise their roles as Dopinder and Blind Al from the previous Deadpool films. Zeb Wells was co-writing the script by then, after previously working on the MCU miniseries She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) and Marvel Zombies (2024) as well as the film The Marvels (2023). In early April, Morena Baccarin said she was in negotiations to reprise her Deadpool role as Vanessa, and she was confirmed to be cast later that month along with Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 returning to provide the voice of Colossus. The following month, Delaney was confirmed to be reprising his role as Peter from Deadpool 2, when Reynolds and Levy were said to have writing credits on the film. Later in May, Brianna Hildebrand and Shioli Kutsuna were revealed to be reprising their respective roles as Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio.",
        "Graham Churchyard and Mayes C. Rubeo served as costume designers. Jackman wears a yellow and blue costume similar to Wolverine's costumes from X-Men: The Animated Series (1992\u20131997) and the comic books, specifically Astonishing X-Men volume 3 (2004\u20132013) drawn by John Cassaday; it also features elements of the character's 1970s design by John Romita Sr. and Dave Cockrum and the 1990s design by Jim Lee. Jackman did not wear a comics-accurate costume in the X-Men film series, though it was referenced in X-Men (2000) and a deleted scene from The Wolverine (2013). Levy felt this could be the last chance for Jackman to wear such a costume, and they went through several iterations and fittings to ensure the suit was comic book-accurate. An early reveal of the costume was met with positive reactions. Some commentators believed it indicated that Jackman was portraying a different iteration of the character from the X-Men films, such as a live-action adaptation of the animated series or comics versions. Reynolds also has an updated costume from the previous Deadpool films, featuring a brighter shade of red and larger black circles on his mask. This is reminiscent of the character's comic book design from the 1990s. Levy was pleased with the \"overwhelmingly positive\" response to the suit designs, which were revealed due to production occurring on location.",
        "Principal photography began on May 22, 2023, in London, and at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, under the working title Tidal Wave. George Richmond served as the cinematographer, after previously working with Levy and Reynolds on Free Guy. Reynolds had lobbied Marvel Studios to film in Vancouver, where he is from and the previous Deadpool films were made, but conceded that \"they have their [established] infrastructure, and you just have to sort of fall in line\". However, a United States Copyright Office filing for the film indicated that some filming did occur in Vancouver. Filming was not expected to be impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began in early May outside of Reynolds being unable to contribute to the script during filming, as he had done during the previous films. Marvel Studios was reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the film's already scheduled reshoots. Levy worked with Marvel Studios and the creative team behind the Netflix series Stranger Things (on which Levy is an executive producer) to allow him to direct at least one episode of that series' final season, since the planned schedules for the two projects were initially expected to overlap.",
        "In June, the film's release date was moved forward to May 3, 2024. Filming for a car crash scene took place on location in London in early July 2023. Shortly after, Jennifer Garner was revealed to be appearing in the film as Elektra, after previously portraying a version of that character in the Fox-produced film Daredevil (2003) and its spin-off Elektra (2005); Garner denied her involvement. Filming with Reynolds and Jackman also took place in Norfolk, and at Bovingdon Film Studios, with the production team preferring to shoot on location rather than on soundstages, where possible, to have the film feel grounded and real. One of these locations included a giant 20th Century Fox logo set piece. Production was suspended on July 14 because of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. 35 days of filming, which was halfway through production, were completed prior to the shutdown, with an additional 35 days left of principal photography. Filming was set to resume following the conclusion of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Levy and Reynolds were able to edit what had already been shot and begin work on the visual effects, though they had not prioritized filming major visual effects sequences before the strike. Prior to the strike, Baccarin had completed filming all of her scenes, and Levy shot a sequence which he likened to the lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi (1983), inspiring the film's stunt team to look to that scene's blocking, tempo, and framing for their scene. Levy said some of the casting rumors surrounding the film were true but others were not, such as Taylor Swift making a cameo appearance as Dazzler. Soni said there were several cameo appearances that were intended to be a surprise for the audience, and added that the film was \"taking full advantage of the MCU\" and would feature jokes about Feige. Disney paid to keep the film's sets intact during the strike.",
        "The film, along with others that were mid-way through production at the start of the strikes, was said to be a top priority for the studios to resume production upon the conclusion of the SAG-AFTRA strike. In October 2023, Levy questioned if the film would be able to retain its May 2024 release date given the SAG-AFTRA strike was still ongoing at that time, shortly before it was reported that the film was likely to be delayed to a date later in 2024 even if filming was able to resume by the start of that year. Levy said the film was still untitled and they were discussing options for a title, noting that he had at times referred to it as Deadpool Versus Wolverine, Deadpool and Wolverine, and Deadpool 3 with Wolverine. After the conclusion of the SAG-AFTRA strike on November 9, filming was expected to resume in London within the following two weeks before Thanksgiving. Reynolds announced that the character Dogpool would appear in the film, played by dog actor Peggy, and the film's release date was pushed back to July 26, 2024. Filming resumed by November 23.",
        "In early December, set photos revealed that the characters Sabretooth and Toad were appearing in the film. The photos of Sabretooth resembled Tyler Mane, who portrayed the character in X-Men, and Toad was also similar to his X-Men appearance. Reynolds commented shortly after about the set photo leaks, saying they created a difficult situation for the production and was hopeful that websites would stop publishing unfinished, out-of-context leaked images to \"preserve as much of that magic as possible for the finished film and the big screen\". He noted that the franchise is associated with leaks, since the first film was able to be made following a leak of its original test footage, and proceeded to post faux leaked images featuring Mickey Mouse, Predator, and Steve Urkel, along with various hashtags to try to alter the social media algorithm around the actual leaked photos, since platforms prioritize posts from high-profile accounts. At the end of December, Bona Film Group signed a deal with TSG Entertainment to invest in a slate of films, including the Deadpool franchise. In early January 2024, Variety reported that the film would include several characters from prior Fox-produced Marvel films and that it was expected to have a similar approach to how Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) features multiple characters from past Spider-Man films. Set photos at the end of the month showed Reynolds portraying a \"samurai-based\" variant of Deadpool. Filming wrapped on January 24.",
        "The film's official title was announced as Deadpool & Wolverine in February 2024 when a teaser trailer was released. The trailer revealed that Macfadyen was portraying TVA agent Paradox, Randal Reeder and Lewis Tan were reprising their respective roles as Buck and Shatterstar from the previous Deadpool films, and Aaron Stanford was returning as John Allerdyce / Pyro from the X-Men films. The copyright filing for the film confirmed that Garner was appearing as Elektra and revealed Corrin's role to be Cassandra Nova. In March 2024, Vinnie Jones, who portrayed Juggernaut in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), said he was asked to reprise the role for the film, but a deal could not be agreed upon with Jones saying there was not enough budget to create the Juggernaut suit for him to wear on set. Shane Reid and Dean Zimmerman are editing the film, while visual effects are provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), W\u0113t\u0101 FX, Base FX, and Barnstorm VFX, with Swen Gillberg serving as the visual effects supervisor."
