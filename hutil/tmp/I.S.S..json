The film stars Ariana DeBose, Chris Messina, John Gallagher Jr., Masha Mashkova, Costa Ronin, and Pilou Asb\u00e6k.\nI.S.S. premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 19, 2024, by Bleecker Street.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nNASA astronaut and former Marine Kira Foster travels with fellow American astronaut Christian Campbell to the International Space Station (ISS). Once there, they greet their teammates: fellow American astronaut Commander Gordon Barrett, and Russian cosmonauts Weronika Vetrov and brothers Nicholai and Alexey Pulov. Despite the language barrier and cultural differences, the Americans and Russians get along well, with Gordon and Weronika having formed a romance. Kira views Earth from the space station for the first time with her coworkers, who explain the overview effect to her.\nLater, while working, she notices numerous massive nuclear explosions across the United States, down below on Earth. Communications aboard the station fail, but Gordon receives a message from the U.S. government indicating that the Russian military has initiated a nuclear attack on the U.S. and ordering him to take control of the ISS \"by any means necessary.\" He discusses the message with Kira and Christian; they suspect the Russians were given a similar order from their government. They also find the station is orbiting too low and in danger of falling towards Earth's surface if aid does not arrive within 24 hours.\nAfter the Americans get their mission, Nicholai tells the crew that an antenna outside the station is broken, requiring Gordon to don an EVA space suit to fix it. Gordon and Kira stay in contact via comms and, while outside, Gordon sees the U.S. destroyed and in flames. He tells Kira to keep the crew away from the windows, so they won't see this. During the operation, under Nicholai's orders, Alexey clips a wire, cutting off communication between Gordon and Kira, inside the station. Alexey replaces it with a fake wire, to hide his sabotage. Unbeknownst to Alexey and Weronika, Nicholai pilots the station's arm to knock Gordon off the station, seemingly to his death. \nEnraged and disgusted with her teammates for murdering her lover, an innocent man, Weronika goes to Kira and devises a plan to trade her Russian key with Kira's American key. The Russian key would unlock the Russian locker where Alexey's research was stored. Weronika explains that Alexey's research could cure radiation sickness, and if either government seizes the space station, that world power will control who lives and who dies in the nuclear war. Weronika insists Kira is the only one she trusts and instructs Kira to take the research, board a Soyuz spacecraft, and return to Earth, leaving the remaining crew to wait for potential aid. Weronika creates a distraction by threatening Alexey and Nicholai with blowing up the station.\nIn the meantime, Kira rummages through the Russian lockers, asking Christian to help locate \"Node Zero\", which Christian says does not exist, leading Kira to conclude Weronika lied to her. Kira and Christian go find their Russian coworkers, and Christian strikes Weronika in the back of the head with a pressurized tank, killing her. After laying Weronika to rest, Nicholai asks Alexey to help him kill the Americans. Alexey refuses, so Nicholai grabs a screwdriver and attempts to do it himself. While Kira and Christian hide in a storage room, Alexey realizes Gordon is still alive and hanging on to the side of the ISS. Alexey uses the arm to bring Gordon back into the station, then helps Kira hide from Nicholai.\nGordon returns and, learning that Weronika was killed, traps Nicholai and attacks him with a drill, while the others try to stop them. Nicholai takes the drill from Gordon and stabs him with it, while Gordon pulls out Nicholai's screwdriver and stabs him, and they both die. After the incident, Kira notices \"NODE0\" written over a Japanese name above a door, revealing Weronika was not lying after all, and goes to find Christian in his sleep pod. There she finds a Soyuz suit and the Russian research, revealing Christian was attempting to return to Earth alone. Meanwhile, Christian quietly sabotages the station's life support system and tries to frame Kira by telling Alexey about Weronika's plan to have Kira take Alexey's research and abandon them. \nChristian tries to attack Kira and Alexey, but they fight back and strangle him to death with the strap of the miniature Soyuz-U that Christian gave Kira as a welcome gift. Alexey suffers a stab wound on his hand during the fight. Kira and Alexey restore the life support system and the communication system finally reactivates, allowing the station to stabilize, and messages from both governments come through asking for confirmation that the astronauts have completed their respective missions to take control of the station. Rather than respond or comply with either governments' orders, they board a Soyuz spacecraft with Alexey's research aboard and plummet to Earth in an uncontrolled free-fall. When Alexey asks where they are going, Kira responds \"I don't know\".\n\nCast[edit]\nAriana DeBose as Dr. Kira Foster, an American astronaut\nChris Messina as Gordon Barrett, an American astronaut\nJohn Gallagher Jr. as Christian Campbell, an American astronaut\nMasha Mashkova as Weronika Vetrov, a Russian cosmonaut\nCosta Ronin as Nicholai Pulov, a Russian cosmonaut\nPilou Asb\u00e6k as Alexey Pulov, a Russian cosmonaut\nProduction[edit]\nIn December 2020, Nick Shafir's screenplay I.S.S. was included on that year's \"Black List\" of most-liked unproduced screenplays.[5] In January 2021, it was announced that the film had been greenlit for production by LD Entertainment with Cowperthwaite directing.
