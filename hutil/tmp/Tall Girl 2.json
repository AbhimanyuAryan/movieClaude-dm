The film stars Ava Michelle, Sabrina Carpenter, Griffin Gluck, and Steve Zahn. It is the sequel to the 2019 film Tall Girl.\nThe film was released on February 11, 2022, and received mixed reviews.[3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nJodi's newfound fame and new desire to get a part in the spring musical, however, prove to be huge roadblocks in her otherwise smooth relationship with Dunkleman. She finds herself fighting her own fears and dealing with anxiety attacks. After landing the lead part of Kim in \u2018Bye Bye Birdie\u2019, Jodi is bewildered. Her insecurities are calling to her through a voice within her head. Tommy plays the lead opposite Jodi in the production and is a possible new love interest.\nJodi deals with typical adolescent issues. She carries a lot of weight on her shoulders between the boy she's dating, her friendships, bullying, the musical, and her uncomfortable parents. She is under a great deal of stress and feels completely overwhelmed.\nBy focusing on her confidence, Jodi eventually discovers a means to filter out that negative voice. She makes the decision to govern her mind rather than the other way around. Her parents go above and beyond to ensure that their children succeed.\nMeanwhile, others are struggling with their own insecurities, while Jodi is battling negative thoughts in her head. Harper, Jodi's sister, is attempting to prove that she is capable of more than just competing in beauty pageants. Fareeda wishes for her parents to believe in her goal of becoming a fashion designer. Dunkleman's connection with Jodi is often questioned.\nJodi's negative inner voice that tells her she's not good enough has been plaguing her since the beginning of rehearsals. And her bully Kimmy, who she beat for the lead role, is now determined to ensure Jodi flakes out.\nKimmy wants to enlist Schnipper in her plots, but he refuses as he has a crush on Jodi since their kiss in the first film. Kimmy finds out that she doesn't have to do much to upset Jodi, so her first week of rehearsals doesn't go as planned, despite Tommy's assurances.\nThe strain eventually takes its toll on Jodi's relationship when Jack, who, after promising her she can skip their anniversary dinner to rehearse, becomes upset when she actually does. They part soon after, and Jodi becomes close to Tommy, with whom she shares a kiss one night.\nJodi starts to reconcile with Jack, but when she admits that she kissed someone else, Jack reacts angrily, and they officially break up. He makes a contract with Stig's sister Stella, who is going through her own break-up, and swears to never see her again.\nJodi participates in the pre-show \u201cburning ceremony\u201d, which is meant to purge the cast of any negativity before their performance. She intends to set fire to the shoes Jack gave her in the first film, but she changes her mind halfway through. Kimmy is the one who saves them from the fire, which marks the beginning of her bully's redemption.\nDespite Tommy's interest in her, Jodi admits that she is still not over Jack, and they agree to merely be friends. Jodi gives Fareeda her blessing to date Stig at the pre-opening night celebration, and Jack appears to give Jodi a pep talk. Stella also gives him a long-overdue scolding for his reaction to Jodi's kiss with Tommy.\nDespite her parents\u2019 guidance on how to deal with nerves, Jodi is still having trouble with her inner voice on the opening night of the show. Kimmy completes her redemption by declining Jodi's offer to take her place on stage, instead telling Jodi that she will stay in the wings and give her cues if she forgets anything.\nOpening night is a success, and after the show, Jodi finally silences her inner critic by reminding herself, that she is good enough to do this. When Jack arrives, he discloses that he has been photographing in the lighting booth all night. He confesses his love for Jodi, which she reciprocates, and they reconcile and kiss.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAva Michelle as Jodi Kreyman\nSabrina Carpenter as Harper Kreyman\nGriffin Gluck as Jack Dunkleman\nLuke Eisner as Stig Mohlin\nAnjelika Washington as Fareeda Marks\nRico Paris as Schnipper\nJohanna Liauw as Stella Mohlin\nClara Wilsey as Kimmy Stitcher\nSteve Zahn as Richie Kreyman\nAngela Kinsey as Helaine Kreyman\nJan Luis Castellanos as Tommy Torres\nChris Wylde as Corey Dunkleman\nRachael Thompson as Ms. Lee\nOdessa Feaster as Fareeda's mom\nDoug Spearman as Fareeda's dad\nProduction[edit]\nOn December 1, 2020, Netflix selected Sam Wolfson to write a Tall Girl sequel, with Ava Michelle set to return as Jodi.[4] Principal photography began on April 12, 2021, and concluded on May 21, 2021, in New Orleans, Louisiana.[5] The film was released on February 11, 2022.[3]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 5.0/10.[6]\nMetacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 35 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Netflix [@netflix] (April 12, 2021). \"tall girl 2 is now in production  u ready? directed by @emilyting917\".
