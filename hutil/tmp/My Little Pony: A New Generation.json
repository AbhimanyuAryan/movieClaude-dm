It was written by Gillian Berrow and Tim Sullivan from a story by Cullen, Ucha and Sullivan. Based on Hasbro's My Little Pony franchise, the film marks the beginning of the fifth incarnation of the franchise, which is set to serve as the official sequel to the previous generation, a first for the franchise. The film also marks Boulder Media's first feature film.\nIt features the voices of Vanessa Hudgens, Kimiko Glenn, James Marsden, Sofia Carson and Liza Koshy. A New Generation is set many years after the events of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, in a magic-less era where the story of Twilight Sparkle and her friends is considered a myth, and the three pony kinds \u2013 earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns \u2013 have grown apart, living separated from one another in paranoia and prejudice.[4] The film follows Sunny Starscout, an earth pony who, after meeting the unicorn Izzy Moonbow, embarks on a quest to reunite all pony kinds and restore magic to the land.[5]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2021. Originally set to be released theatrically by Paramount Pictures, it was instead released in most countries on Netflix on September 24, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while still being theatrically released in several Asian countries. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics for its message, though its pacing and writing received some criticism, and was the most-viewed film on Netflix in October 2021. A follow-up television series, My Little Pony: Make Your Mark, premiered through Netflix on May 2022.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn the earth pony town of Maretime Bay, Argyle Starshine teaches his daughter Sunny Starscout about tales of old Equestria when earth ponies, pegasi and unicorns lived in harmony. Although most earth ponies dismiss these ideas as myths and now live in fear of the other races, Sunny hopes that all races can make amends and live in harmony.\nYears later, Sunny continuously tries to change the minds of the other earth ponies, disrupting a showcase of anti-pegasi and unicorn technology by factory owner Phyllis Cloverleaf. Hitch Trailblazer, Sunny's childhood friend and sheriff of Maretime Bay, pulls her away and prepares to send her back home with the warning that she is jeopardizing their friendship with her activities. Suddenly, a unicorn named Izzy Moonbow wanders into the town. While most of the earth ponies flee, Sunny befriends Izzy and quickly takes her to her home to hide from Hitch and his deputy Sprout, Phyllis' son. Learning from Izzy that unicorns have lost their magic and that the pegasi may be to blame, Sunny travels with her to the pegasus city of Zephyr Heights in order to ask for their help. The two elude Hitch and flee town, and Hitch leaves Sprout in charge while he pursues them. Sprout names himself sheriff and eventually becomes a dictator-like leader, turning the residents of Maretime Bay into a hostile mob and commandeering his mother's factory to construct a war machine.\nSunny and Izzy are caught in Zephyr Heights and taken to meet Queen Haven and her two daughters, Pipp Petals and Zipp Storm, who seem to be the only pegasi who can fly. When Sunny starts asking about magic, Haven has them imprisoned in the castle dungeon. Zipp secretly visits them there and tells them that the pegasi have also lost their magic and cannot fly, and the royal family uses wires to give the illusion of flight. She helps them escape and takes them to an abandoned transit station that Sunny realizes was used by all pony races in the past. Sunny finds a set of stained glass windows depicting two crystals \u2013 one of which is set in Haven's crown \u2013 that may fit together and bring back the magic. The three concoct a plan to steal the crown during Pipp's performance that night. Hitch's arrival triggers a series of mishaps that reveal the royals' inability to fly; Haven is arrested, and the sisters are forced to flee. While Pipp is initially angry with her sister, she returns the crystal and helps the group escape the city. Hitch overcomes his own prejudices and offers to help Sunny in her effort to reunite the pony races.\nIzzy escorts the group to her home in the forest village of Bridlewood and disguises them as unicorns before leading them to Alphabittle, who holds the unicorn crystal. Sunny wins it from him in a dance competition, but loses her disguise as she celebrates. As the group flees with the two crystals, they come across Haven, who has also escaped. Sunny and Izzy try to put the two crystals together, but they have no effect. Dejected, Sunny gives back the crystals and returns to Maretime Bay with Hitch.\nWhile packing up her childhood toys, Sunny finds a third crystal intended to join with the other two, built into a lamp her father had made for her. As she races to tell Hitch, they discover that Sprout has turned the entire town to his side and is piloting his war machine to attack the other pony races. Sunny and Hitch rush back to her home as Izzy, Pipp, Zipp, Haven, and Alphabittle arrive. Gathering the crystals, Sunny, Izzy, and Pipp try to put them together while Hitch and Zipp hold off Sprout's machine. Phyllis orders Sprout to stop, but he refuses and crashes into Sunny's home, destroying it and the frame in which the crystals must be set. Phyllis, Haven, Alphabittle, and Sunny's friends put aside their differences and come together to comfort her amid the rubble. In response, the crystals activate, temporarily transforming Sunny into an alicorn, giving her a new hairstyle with colored bangs, and restoring magic across the land. Sunny and her friends celebrate as the ponies of all three races cooperate to fix the damage done by Sprout and a new era of peace begins.\n\nCast[edit]\nVanessa Hudgens as Sunny Starscout,[6] an adventurous and virtuous earth pony-turned-alicorn who enjoys roller skating and wants all pony kinds to get along, and tries to return magic to the world in order to unite the three types of ponies as equals[7]\nKimiko Glenn as Izzy Moonbow,[6] an energetic and curious unicorn from the Bridlewood Forest that loves crafting, who is the first non-earth pony Sunny befriended[7]\nJames Marsden as Hitch Trailblazer,[6] an earth pony who is the kind and hard-working sheriff at Maretime Bay and Sunny's childhood friend[7]\nSofia Carson as Pipp Petals,[6] a  Pegasus princess from Zephyr Heights who is a talented pop icon and loves to be a good influence on others and entertain other ponies with her music[7]\nLiza Koshy as Zephyrina \"Zipp\" Storm,[6] Pipp's older sister and a rebellious Pegasus princess from Zephyr Heights who enjoys athletics and science[7]\nElizabeth Perkins as Phyllis Cloverleaf, an earth pony who owns Canterlogic, a company specializing in products to keep earth ponies \"safe and stylish\"[8][9]\nJane Krakowski as Queen Haven,[8] a pegasus who is the mother of Pipp and Zipp and the monarch of Zephyr Heights[5]\nKen Jeong as Sprout Cloverleaf,[8][10] an earth pony stallion, Phyllis' son, and deputy sheriff to Hitch at Maretime Bay[5]\nAlan Schmuckler provides Sprout's singing voice.\nPhil LaMarr as Alphabittle,[8] a unicorn stallion from the Bridlewood Forest[5]\nMichael McKean as Argyle Starshine,[8] Sunny's father who tells her stories about Twilight Sparkle and her friends[5]\nAdditionally, Arturo Hern\u00e1ndez voices Jasper, Thunder, and Toots; Brooke Goldner voices Sweets; Gillian Berrow voices Zoom; Heather Langenkamp voices Dazzle Feather and Mayflower; Will Friedle voices Comet Tail, Glitter Cupcake and Skye Silver; and director Robert Cullen voices Sparkle Chaser, Rob the Pony and Wings.

She praised the film for \"[retaining] its predecessors' lively, spirited drive centered on friendship, empowerment and magic,\" though was critical of some plot aspects.[10] Beatrice Loayza of The New York Times gave an overall mixed review of the film, mainly criticizing the switch from traditional animation to \"creepily-anthropomorphized, digitally-animated brethren\"; she compared some plot points to Raya and the Last Dragon, which was released earlier in the year. But overall, Loayza said, \"...the film's messaging about unity and the need for a new generation to band together against misinformation and rabble rousing isn't the worst thing.\"[39]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominee\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2021\nUrsa Major Awards\nBest Motion Picture\nRobert Cullen and Jos\u00e9 Luis Ucha\nNominated\n[40]\n\nFollow-ups[edit]\nPrior to the film's release, during the 2021 Hasbro Investor Event in February that year, the company announced three untitled projects tied to the fifth incarnation of the toyline (also referred to as the fifth generation or \"G5\"[41]) as part of their My Little Pony content slate for 2022\u2014an animated web series and two Netflix specials.[42]\nFollowing the cancellation of the film's theatrical release, Hasbro and Netflix later announced a fourth project\u2014a 3D computer-animated streaming television series titled My Little Pony: Make Your Mark\u2014would also be released on the streaming platform, following the film.[43] Jenna Warren, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Ana Sani, AJ Bridel, and J.J.
