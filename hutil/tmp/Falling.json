    "Production": [
        "In October 2018, it was announced Viggo Mortensen would star in the film, alongside Lance Henriksen, Sverrir Gu\u00f0nason, and directing from a screenplay he wrote. Mortensen and Daniel Bekerman will serve as producers on the film under their Scythia Films banner. In March 2019, Laura Linney, Hannah Gross and Terry Chen joined the cast of the film.",
        "Mortensen had not originally intended to play the lead role in the film himself, but found that since there were virtually no other major stars in the cast, committing to act in the film was the only way he was able to secure production funding.",
        "Though not an autobiographical piece, Mortensen was influenced by feelings from his upbringing. One of the first scenes of the movie where Mortensen's character shoots a duck as a young boy and decides to keep the dead bird as a pet actually happened to him as a child.",
        "Principal photography began in March 2019. Filming took place in Los Angeles and Northern Ontario."
