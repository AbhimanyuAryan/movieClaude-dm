On July 8, 2021, it was reported that John Boyega replaced Majors due to a scheduling conflict with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

    "Reception": [
        "In the United States and Canada, Breaking was released alongside The Invitation and Three Thousand Years of Longing. The film debuted to $985,921 from 902 theaters in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $2.8 million at the box office.",
        "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 156 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Breaking struggles to effectively convey its messages, but its noble intentions are well served by John Boyega's electrifying performance.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film a 55% overall positive score.",
        "Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood said, \"Corbin is firmly in control behind the camera and with particular expert help with her editor Chris Witt. The British actor Boyega is superb in every aspect of the role, as is the commanding presence of the late Williams in what, sadly, is his final film role.\"",
        "Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge said, \"This is not an act of documentary reenactment so much as a tense, speculative drama, imagining what this man must have gone through during those hours, and how his actions rippled out to affect others' lives.\""
