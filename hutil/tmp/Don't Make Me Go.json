        "Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a B, calling it \"a joy, heartbreaking and heartening in equal measure.\" Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"a solidly likable drama, anchored by lovely, lived-in chemistry between John Cho and Mia Isaac as a father-daughter duo,\" but added that \"a misguided third-act choice throws off its bittersweet vibe, leaving a distinctly sour aftertaste.\" Michael Nordine of Variety also criticized the film's third act as \"questionable.\""
