The film is directed by Greg Barker, from a screenplay written by Craig Borten. It stars Wagner Moura, Ana de Armas, Garret Dillahunt, Clemens Schick, Will Dalton, Bradley Whitford and Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne.[1]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 28, 2020. It was released on April 17, 2020, by Netflix.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 2003, United Nations' Special Representative in Iraq, S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, is a victim of a bombing and becomes trapped in the basement of the hotel where he was working in Baghdad.\nThree months earlier, Sergio is married but there is no feeling of love in the marriage. Instead, he commits to being with Carolina, his girlfriend and co-worker. Against the advice of Carolina, Sergio decides to go to Baghdad after the 2003 invasion of Iraq in order to help Iraqis achieve independence and negotiate the withdrawal of American troops. He comes to a disagreement with American diplomat Paul Bremer who opposes his methods despite the pressure from the United States, and fights against the U.S. occupation of Iraq. He even insists on not having U.S. guards at the UN's base camp in order to separate themselves from the U.S. occupiers.\nSergio is killed by a terrorist attack that takes place on the UN base camp. Later, the U.S. pulls out of Iraq leading to a long Civil War, but Sergio's gravely injured colleague Gil Loescher survives despite having both legs amputated, and Carolina returns to her justice work in Rio.\n\nCast[edit]\nWagner Moura as S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to Iraq\nAna de Armas as Carolina Larriera, UN economic consultant and S\u00e9rgio's girlfriend\nGarret Dillahunt as Master Sergeant William von Zehle, a US Army Reserve Civil Affairs soldier\nBr\u00edan F.

The website's critics consensus reads: \"While the real-life story that inspired Sergio is certainly worthy of a biopic, its misguided approach to its noble subject adds up to a disappointingly shallow drama.\"[7] On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 55 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Sergio Reviews\".
