Produced by Columbia Pictures, PlayStation Productions, and 2.0 Entertainment, it is based on the racing simulation video game series  of the same name developed by Polyphony Digital. It tells the true story of British teenager Jann Mardenborough, a teenage Gran Turismo player who became a professional racing car driver. The film stars Archie Madekwe as Mardenborough alongside David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Darren Barnet, Geri Halliwell Horner, and Djimon Hounsou.[5]\nDevelopment of a film based on Gran Turismo was revealed in July 2013, with Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti producing and a script by Alex Tse. Joseph Kosinski was set to direct the film in June 2015 from a new screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber. However, the Kosinski version was no longer moving forward as of February 2018. In May 2022, it was announced the film was again in development, with Blomkamp attached to direct it in June. The main cast were announced in September 2022, while other cast additions signed in November. Filming began in Hungary in the same month and wrapped in December. The film score was composed by Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski.\nGran Turismo premiered at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium on July 30, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 25, 2023, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It has grossed $122 million worldwide against its $60 million budget and received positive reviews from critics, who praised Blomkamp's direction and racing sequences, but criticized its writing and use of Mardenborough's crash at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife as a narrative element.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nFollowing a pitch by marketing executive Danny Moore, Nissan, establishes the GT Academy to recruit skilled players of the racing simulator Gran Turismo and turn them into real racing drivers. Danny recruits former driver-turned-mechanic Jack Salter to train the players. Reluctant at first, Jack accepts the offer after tiring of his team\u2019s driver\u2019s arrogance, Nicholas Capa. Meanwhile, Jann Mardenborough, a teenage computer gamer from Cardiff, is an avid player who dreams of becoming a racing driver despite the disapproval of his former football player father, Steve.\nOne day, Jann learns he is eligible to join the GT Academy after setting a time record. The night before his race, Jann and his brother are invited to a party, where Jann develops a crush on a young woman, Audrey . However, the police arrive, and Jann and his brother are caught. As punishment, Jann is brought to his father's place of employment the next day, but leaves early to partake in the qualifying race, which he wins, earning a place in GT Academy.\nAt the academy camp, Jack puts the competitors through their paces in various tests, through which ten competitors are narrowed down to five. During the tests, Jann impresses Jack with his knowledge after asserting that a wreck was caused by his car\u2019s brakes being glazed, later proven correct by analysts. The remaining five competitors compete in a final race to determine who will represent Nissan. Jann narrowly wins the race against American competitor Matty Davis, but Danny insists Matty should be chosen as the representative due to his better commercial viability. However, Jann is selected at Jack's insistence.\nJann is told that if he finishes at least fourth in any one of a series of qualifying races, he will earn a professional license and contract with Nissan. In his first professional race in Austria, he finishes last after Nicholas taps him into a spin, and despite gradually improving over the next few races, he does not finish the penultimate race in Spain. He travels to Dubai for his last qualifying race, during which Nicholas crashes, and despite debris damaging Jann\u2019s car, he achieves a fourth-place finish and earns his license. He then travels to Tokyo with Danny and Jack to sign his contract and uses his signing bonus to fly Audrey to Tokyo as they start a relationship.\nJann's first race after signing is at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. He starts the race well and maintains a high position until the front of his car lifts into the air at the Flugplatz corner, hitting a barrier and launching into a crowded spectator area. Jann is airlifted to the N\u00fcrburgring Medical Center and is informed while in hospital that a spectator was killed in the crash, much to his horror. When Jann is reluctant to return to racing and blames himself for the spectator's death, Jack returns him to the N\u00fcrburgring. He reveals that he was involved in a fatal accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which led to a fellow driver dying and subsequently Jack's retirement from driving. He encourages Jann to return to racing. An inquiry clears Jann of any wrongdoing, but professional sentiment turns against sim drivers. In response, Danny decides that a sim driver team needs to compete at Le Mans and finish on the podium to prove their viability.\nDanny enlists Matty and fellow GT Academy participant Antonio Cruz to make up the three-driver team alongside Jann. On race day, Jann's father apologizes for not initially supporting his passions. Early in the race, Jann is left shaken after one of the competitors crashes and catches fire, but is encouraged through his first shift by Jack playing \"Songbird\" and \"Orinoco Flow\" through the car's communication system, songs which Jann had previously used as motivational music during training. Matty and Antonio complete their first shifts without issue, but the latter is brought in from his last session early due to experiencing cramps. A wheel nut is dropped by mechanic Felix during the pit stop, causing Jann to lose several positions. Deviating from advised racing lines, he uses instead lines he learned from playing the video game to regain his position, breaking the lap record in the process. On the final lap, Jann is pitted against Nicholas, with Jann once again narrowly in front on the final straight to earn third place and a podium finish for Nissan.\nIn the epilogue, the real Jann Mardenborough is shown, having competed in over 200 races and served as his own stunt double in the film.\n\nCast[edit]\nArchie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough, a young retail worker and a fan of the Gran Turismo video games aspiring to become a professional racer.\nJann Mardenborough also portrays himself, serving as Madekwe's stunt double.\nDavid Harbour as Jack Salter, a former professional racer turned mechanic who becomes Jann's trainer for the GT Academy.\nOrlando Bloom as Danny Moore, a marketing executive at Nissan.\nTakehiro Hira as Kazunori Yamauchi, the creator of Gran Turismo.\nThe real Yamauchi cameos as a sushi chef in Tokyo.\nDarren Barnet as Matty Davis, a top GT Academy driver and Jann's rival, later co-driver for Jann at Le Mans.\nGeri Halliwell-Horner as Lesley Mardenborough, Jann's mother.\nDjimon Hounsou as Steve Mardenborough, a former footballer turned miner and Jann's father.\nJosha Stradowski as Nicholas Capa, a hot-headed and underhanded driver who rivals Jann.\nDaniel Puig as Coby Mardenborough, Jann's brother.\nMaeve Courtier-Lilley as Audrey, Jann's love interest.\nPepe Barroso as Antonio Cruz, a Spanish GT Academy student driver, one of Jann's friends and later co-driver for Jann at Le Mans.

Shortly afterward, Neill Blomkamp was hired to direct a screenplay written by Jason Hall, and Sony set a release date of August 11, 2023.[11] The lead roles were cast in September 2022 with David Harbour as a veteran race car driver who mentors Archie Madekwe as the teenage trainee,[12][13] with the film being confirmed to also be a biographical film based on the story of Jann Mardenborough. Orlando Bloom was cast as a motorsport marketing executive and Darren Barnet as a threatened GT Academy racer.[14] Additional cast additions were announced while filming in November included Djimon Hounsou, Geri Halliwell-Horner, Daniel Puig, Josha Stradowski, Thomas Kretschmann, Maeve Courtier-Lilley, Emelia Hartford, Pepe Barroso, and Sang Heon Lee.[15][16] Max Mundt, Mariano Gonz\u00e1lez, Harki Bhambra, Lindsay Pattison, Th\u00e9o Christine, and Nikhil Parmar were added to the cast in December 2022.[17]\n\nFilming[edit]\nFilming began in Hungary in November, and wrapped in December 2022, with Jacques Jouffret serving as cinematographer.[14][15][18] Jouffret took advantage of the Rialto extension/detachment system of Sony Venice 2 cameras in order to place sensors in tight locations of cars, away from the main camera body.[19] Jann Mardenborough himself is a co-producer on the film and served as the racing stunt double for Madekwe, who portrayed him.\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Gran Turismo (soundtrack)\nIn September 2022, it was reported that Stephen Barton would compose the score for the film.[20] But on April 24, 2023, Lorne Balfe was announced to take over by scoring the film instead.[21] The soundtrack album, also composed by Andrew Kawczynski, was released on August 11, 2023, the same day as the limited theatrical release.[22]\n\nRelease[edit]\nGran Turismo premiered at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps on July 30, 2023, following the Formula One 2023 Belgian Grand Prix.[23] Gran Turismo held several preview screenings beginning on August 11, 2023, before being released in the United States on August 25, by Sony Pictures Releasing.[24] It was originally scheduled for a wide release on August 11,[25] but plans changed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike.[24] Despite the delay in the United States, the film's release date remains unchanged in various international markets such as the United Kingdom, where the film was released on August 9, 2023.[26]\nAn update to Gran Turismo 7 added a livery for the Nissan Nismo GT-R that was inspired by the film, and was given for free to all players who watched the movie trailer in-game.[27]\nGran Turismo was released on digital platforms on September 26, 2023[28] and, in selected markets, was one of the first early-access titles on the Sony Pictures Core platform;[29] it was later released on Blu-ray and DVD on November 7.[30][31] The movie was released on Netflix as part of a first-window deal on December 25, 2023.[32]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nGran Turismo has grossed $44.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $77.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $122.1 million.[3][4]\nIn the United States and Canada, Gran Turismo was released alongside The Hill, Retribution, and Golda, and was projected to gross $12\u201315 million from 3,856 theaters in its opening weekend.[33] The film made $8.5 million on its first day, including $5.3 million from several preview screenings in the weeks leading up to its release. It went on to debut to $17.4 million, finishing first at the box office, though Warner Bros. claimed its holdover Barbie actually won the weekend with $15.1 million, disputing Sony's inclusion of the $5.3 million from weeks of previews; other studios and trade publications sided with Sony, noting lumping preview screenings into opening day figures is standard practice.[34][35][36] The film made $6.6 million in its second weekend (a drop of 64%) and finishing fourth, then grossed $3.5 million in its third weekend.[37][38]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 65% of 225 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Gran Turismo's brisk action and feel-good underdog drama are undermined by its loose telling of the fact-based story, but this is still a generally solid racing movie.\"[39] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[40] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 90% overall positive score.[34]\nThe racing sequences and Blomkamp's direction, especially during the climactic 24-hour race in France, were praised by most critics, who noted that, while transitioning from its video game origins to a standard race car film, Gran Turismo also serves as a cautionary example of adapting source material that may not align with a cohesive narrative.[41] Owen Gleiberman of Variety said of the film, \"There's an innocence to this one, and a surprise authenticity,\" commenting, \"It's like a Fast and Furious movie made without cynicism, and it gets to you\", finding the climax \"satisfying\".[42] Kristen Lopez of TheWrap said, \"Gran Turismo works best because it eschews its video game origins quickly before settling into a standard race car film. It's unknown how fans of the game will respond to the movie \u2014 no one watching the movie in this critic's theater pointed out any specific game Easter eggs \u2014 but on the whole fans of racecar films should be in for a good time.\"[43]\nConversely, Ryan Gilbey's negative review for the Guardian called the film \"a simulation of cinema, with scarcely a human fingerprint anywhere on its chassis.\"[44] Tim Robey of the Telegraph called the film \"a purringly complacent insult to a great video-game\".[45] Oli Welsh of Polygon gave the film a negative review, saying that \"Gran Turismo could have used this inspiring true story to show how video games open up possibilities and remove barriers in the real world. Instead, it just uses it to score points.\"[46]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nThe film was nominated for \"Best Adaptation\" at The Game Awards 2023.[47]\n\nCriticism of crash depiction[edit]\nThe film was widely criticized for its use of Mardenborough's crash at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife as a narrative element. This segment faithfully re-enacted a 2015 crash during which his Nissan GT-R Nismo became airborne at the notorious Flugplatz turn and cartwheeled over the fence into spectators.[48] One spectator was killed almost immediately and others were taken to the hospital   with serious and severe injuries.[48][49] This crash was depicted in Gran Turismo as a traumatic event for Mardenborough that impacted his racing performance during his debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In reality, the crash occurred roughly two years after his Le Mans debut.[50][51][52]\nThe use of a dead spectator to enhance the plot was negatively received by critics, with the film being  labeled as \"tasteless\" and \"reprehensible\".[53][46] In her review, Grace Randolph speculated that other critics would temper their approval of Gran Turismo because of the way it frames the accident.[54]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ September 15, 2023 coincides with the same date of the Pretty Cure All Stars F  release.\n\n^ Later marketed as Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Gran Turismo (12A)\".
