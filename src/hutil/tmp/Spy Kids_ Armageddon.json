It is the standalone sequel[1] to Spy Kids: All the Time in the World (2011) and the fifth installment in the Spy Kids film series. Produced by Skydance Media, Spyglass Media Group and Troublemaker Studios, the film stars Gina Rodriguez (no relation to the director[2]), Zachary Levi, Connor Esterson, and Everly Carganilla.\nSpy Kids: Armageddon was released on September 22, 2023, by Netflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics.[3][4]\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (October 2023)\nWhen the children of the world's greatest secret agents unwittingly help a powerful game developer unleash a computer virus that gives him control of all technology, they must become spies themselves to save their parents and the world.[5]\n\nCast[edit]\nGina Rodriguez as Nora Torrez[6]\nZachary Levi as Terrence Tango[6]\nConnor Esterson as Antonio \"Tony\" Tango-Torrez[6]\nEverly Carganilla as Patricia \"Patty\" Tango-Torrez[6]\nD. J. Cotrona as Devlin. The character was previously portrayed by George Clooney in Spy Kids and Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.\nBilly Magnussen as Rey \u201cThe King\u201d Kingston, the main antagonist[6]\nJoe Schilling as the voice of Heck Knight\nSolar Dena Bennett and Fabiola And\u00fajar[7] as OSS Agents\nIsaac Garza as the tournament host\nKrystle Gutierrez as a newscaster\nProduction[edit]\nA reboot of the Spy Kids franchise was revealed to be in development in January 2021, with a film involving a plot that centers around a multicultural family. Series creator Robert Rodriguez returns as writer and director; the project is a joint-venture production between Skydance Media, Spyglass Media Group, and Double R Productions.[8][9][10] Netflix acquired distribution rights the next year in March, making it the second Spy Kids project produced for the platform, while David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, Racer Max (Rodriguez's son), and Elizabeth Avell\u00e1n (Rodriguez's ex-wife) joined as producers.[11]\nThe title was revealed to be Spy Kids: Armageddon, which was the original name for the previous film installment, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World (2011).[10] Along with the announcement of Max co-writing, and Rodriguez producing, the film's cast was revealed in the summer of 2022: Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Everly Carganilla, Connor Esterson, Billy Magnussen and D. J. Cotrona.[12][13][14] Production wrapped in late August that same year.[15][16][17]\n\nRelease[edit]\nSpy Kids: Armageddon was released in the United States on Netflix on September 22, 2023.[11][18]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 54% of 35 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Spy Kids: Armageddon offers solidly diverting action for younger viewers, even if it's starting to feel like this franchise has run out of reasons to continue.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[20]\nSamantha Bergeson of IndieWire says it \"will certainly appeal to kids today, the kind that fall into the pre-tween age group who still dream about joining the CIA. As spy boss Devlin says at the end of the film, it\u2019s simply onto the next mission for the 'Spy Kids' family. Will that sequel rival 'Spy Kids 2'? Stay tuned.\"[21] Maggie Lovitt of Collider says it \"may never be the generation-defining cult classic that its predecessors were, but it is still a long-overdue return to an unparalleled universe. In Rodriguez\u2019s world, hopepunk rules, and very few storytellers feel compelled to tell stories where there\u2019s unwavering optimism and hope for the future.\"[22]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Polowy, Kevin (September 22, 2023). \"Can 'Spy Kids' be the next James Bond?

But because it'd been so long [since 2011's All the Time in the World], it was important to just start the franchise fresh and then go from there. I would love to bring back [characters], I would love to connect the worlds. That would be so fun.\"\n\n^  https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/spy-kids-easter-eggs-netflix#:~:text=Carganilla%2C%20who%20plays%20the%20pint,her%20mother%20in%20the%20movie.\n\n^ Kroll, Justin (January 26, 2021). \"Skydance Media To Reimagine The 'Spy Kids' Franchise With Spyglass Media And Series Creator Robert Rodriguez\".
