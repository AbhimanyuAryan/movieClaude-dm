It stars Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Charlie Plummer, Kelly Yu, Carolina Bartczak, and Donald Sutherland. It follows two former astronauts alongside a conspiracy theorist who discover the hidden truth about the Moon when it suddenly leaves its orbit. Shot in Montreal on a $138\u2013146 million budget, it is one of the most expensive independently produced films ever made.\nThe film was theatrically released in North America on February 4, 2022, by Lionsgate, and in the United Kingdom on the same day by Entertainment Film Distributors. It underperformed at the box office, grossing $67 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 2011, astronauts Brian Harper, Jocinda \"Jo\" Fowler, and newcomer Alan Marcus are on a Space Shuttle mission to repair a satellite. A mysterious swarm of alien technology attacks the orbiter, killing Alan and knocking Jo unconscious before tunneling into the surface of the Moon. Brian, the only witness to the swarm, returns the crippled shuttle to Earth, but his story is dismissed and he is fired from NASA.\nTen years later, conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman, who believes that the Moon is an artificial megastructure, secretly uses a research telescope. He discovers that the Moon's orbit is veering closer to Earth, and tries to share his findings with the disgraced Brian. NASA also discovers the anomaly, but K.C. goes public on social media, leading to a global panic. Jo is now NASA's deputy director, launching a spacecraft on an SLS Block 1 rocket to investigate the abnormality. The same alien swarm attacks, killing all three lunar astronauts after they drop a probe into a kilometers-deep artificial shaft that has opened up on the Moon's surface.\nAs the lunar orbit deteriorates, the Moon falls closer and closer to the Earth, causing seismic and gravitational disturbances. Jo meets former NASA official Holdenfield, who reveals that Brian was discredited due to a NASA coverup dating back to Apollo 11; during the first Moon landing, a two-minute radio blackout was meant to conceal evidence of pulsating lights on the surface. Apollo 12 revealed that the Moon is hollow, and a military EMP device created to kill the swarm was abandoned for budgetary reasons.\nWith help from her ex-husband General Doug Davidson, Air Force Chief of Staff, Jo requisitions the EMP and rescues retired Space Shuttle Endeavour from a museum to serve the new mission: to correct the Moon's orbit and destroy the swarm. Brian, K.C., and Jo launch with the EMP, narrowly escaping to orbit as a tsunami destroys Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nThey reach the interior of the Moon, revealed to be a Dyson sphere powered by a white dwarf at its center. The Dyson sphere's AI operating system explains to Brian that billions of years ago, humanity's technologically advanced ancestors were eradicated by a rogue AI; they built the Moon as an interstellar ark to create and seed life on Earth, but the swarm \u2014 the malicious AI \u2014 discovered the Moon and is siphoning energy from its power source, destabilizing its orbit.\nMeanwhile, Brian's son Sonny, Jo's son Jimmy, and his caretaker Michelle try to reach Doug's military bunker in the Colorado mountains, finding Brian's ex-wife and Sonny's mother Brenda, her husband Tom, and their step-family. Escaping disasters caused by the Moon's proximity and fighting off other survivors, the group finds safety in a mountain tunnel. When his youngest daughter runs out of oxygen, an injured Tom gives her his own, suffocating to death as the Moon strips away the local atmosphere. The president orders a nuclear strike on the approaching Moon, but Doug refuses to comply, with debris collapsing the bunker shortly thereafter, presumably killing Doug and everyone inside.\nAs the swarm only attacks organic life in the presence of electronic activity, K.C. lures the swarm away from their spacecraft with their lunar module, sacrificing himself to detonate the EMP. Jo and Brian return to Earth, reuniting with their families, and the Moon's power is restored, returning to its regular orbit, but now shed of its rocky exterior. Reconstructing K.C.'s consciousness, the Moon's operating system appears to K.C. as his cat, Fuzz Aldrin, and his mother, remarking that they must now \"get started\".\n\nCast[edit]\nHalle Berry and Patrick Wilson play former NASA astronauts Jocinda Fowler and Brian Harper.\nHalle Berry as Jocinda Fowler, a former NASA astronaut now serving as deputy director of NASA and Brian Harper's colleague who once flew together on a Space Shuttle Endeavour mission\nPatrick Wilson as Brian Harper, a disgraced former NASA astronaut and Jo's colleague who flew on a Space Shuttle Endeavour mission.\nJohn Bradley as K.C.

A museum in Florida contributed an original Space Shuttle cockpit, and NASA provided various data regarding the spacecraft.[9]\n1,700 visual effects shots were done for Moonfall, primarily handled by four companies, Scanline VFX, Pixomondo, DNEG and Framestore. Scanline was involved as early as a teaser done during the production of Midway for the Cannes pitch, a shot of the Moon coming up behind the Earth that ended up in the finished film.[20]\n\nMusic[edit]\nFor the recording of the score, composer Thomas Wander returned to Synchron Stage Vienna in the autumn of 2021, where Midway's soundtrack had previously been recorded.[21][22]\nThe soundtrack album, containing a total of 23 pieces of music, was released as a download by Atlantic Screen Music/Filmtrax on February 4, 2022.[23]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film held a premiere in Los Angeles on January 31, 2022.[24] It was released theatrically in the United States on February 4, 2022. It was previously scheduled to be released on October 22, 2021.[25] Despite having been advertised in 2021, the film's theatrical release in Canada was canceled because the local distributor, Mongrel Media, found it too risky to go forward with the release and spend the amount of money required on advertising when it was uncertain whether theaters in Ontario and Quebec, which account for a majority of film sales in the country and were shut down due to the pandemic, would be open in time.[26] The film was released in China on March 25, 2022.[27]\nLionsgate spent approximately $35 million in promotions and advertisements, including $12.2 million on TV ads. Social media monitor RelishMix said online reactions were \"mixed to negative\" while \"awareness stats\" were below average. The film had a social media reach of 88.9 million interactions (including 51.1 million views on YouTube) from 31 videos shared online, which featured brand deals with Omega SA and Lexus. RelishMix also said \"traction ran thin\" and that online audiences \"questioned the use of the Space Shuttle which has been out of commission since 2011 and chatted about rumors that the movie was heading straight to Netflix\", while Emmerich was drawing backlash \"for 'hating the Earth'\".[5]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was released for VOD platforms on April 1, 2022, followed by a Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K UHD release on April 26, 2022, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment.[28]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nMoonfall grossed $19.1\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $48.2\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $67.3\u00a0million.[3]\nIn the United States, Moonfall was released alongside Jackass Forever, and was projected to gross $8\u201311 million from 3,446 theaters in its opening weekend,[29] with Boxoffice Pro predicting a $9\u201314 million three-day debut.[30] The film earned $3.4 million on its first day,[31] including an estimated $700,000 from Thursday night previews. Around 300 theaters were closed on Thursday due to a winter storm impacting most of the Midwestern United States. It went on to gross $9.9 million in its opening weekend, finishing second.[5][32] The film suffered a 70% decline in its second weekend after earning $2.9 million.[33] Moonfall dropped out of the box-office top ten in its third weekend with $1.1 million.[34]\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, the film grossed an estimated $9.37 million overseas in its opening weekend.[35] It made $9.7 million in its first weekend in China, debuting at the first position by displacing The Batman.[36] The film released in the country when a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic forced more than half of theaters to close.[37] It retained its position during the following weekend with a gross of $3.2 million.[38] In the third weekend it fell to the fourth place while grossing $900,000.[39]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 35% of 215 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.40/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Whether Moonfall is so bad it's good or simply bad will depend on your tolerance for B-movie cheese \u2013 but either way, this is an Emmerich disaster thriller through and through.\"[40] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 41 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[41] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it a 66% positive score, with 49% saying they would definitely recommend it.[5]\nWhile appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 2nd, 2023, Neil deGrasse Tyson conveyed to Stephen Colbert that by far Moonfall was a movie which violated more laws of physics per minute than any other science fiction movie he had ever seen, surpassing what he regarded as the previous record, the 1998 movie Armageddon.[42]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn January 2022, Emmerich spoke about the possibility of filming two sequels back-to-back if the first film was a success.[8] The following month, star John Bradley said that \"if Roland goes down the direction that he wants to\", the sequels would be \"even more batshit crazy than the first\".[43]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Moonfall (12A)\".
