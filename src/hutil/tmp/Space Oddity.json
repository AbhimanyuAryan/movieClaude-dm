It stars Kyle Allen, Alexandra Shipp, Madeline Brewer, Carrie Preston, Simon Helberg and Kevin Bacon.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nA man tries to secure insurance in order to go on a one-way trip to Mars but falls in love.\n\nCast[edit]\nKyle Allen as Alex McAllister\nAlexandra Shipp as Daisy Taylor\nMadeline Brewer as Liz\nKevin Bacon as Jeff McAllister\nSimon Helberg as Dmitri\nCarrie Preston as Jane McAllister\nArden Myrin as Lisa\nProduction[edit]\nIt was announced in June 2021 that Kyra Sedgwick would direct the film, written by Rebecca Banner, with Kyle Allen, Alexandra Shipp and Madeline Brewer set to star.[1] In July, Kevin Bacon, Simon Helberg and Carrie Preston were added to the cast.[2]\nFilming began in June 2021, with production taking place throughout Rhode Island.[3][4]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its premiere at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival on June 12, 2022.[5] It was released by Samuel Goldwyn Films on March 31, 2023.[6]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 27 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10.[7] Manuel Betancourt of Variety wrote, \"If the film never quite finds a way to marry its high concept premise, its twee romance, and its family melodrama into one cohesive narrative, it is not for lack of trying.\"[8] Robert Abele of TheWrap wrote, \"That\u2019s a compelling set-up for a knotty family story, but not as evidenced by the surface cutes that keep real feeling at bay in this curiously uninvolving directorial effort from Kyra Sedgwick.\"[9] In a positive review, Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com wrote, \"[The film] isn\u2019t an overly cinematic viewing experience, but it has deep feeling for its characters and an unusual approach to the trials of grief, going in compelling directions as the whole thing works hard to avoid becoming a melodrama.\"[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ D'Alessandro, Anthony (June 22, 2021). \"Kyra Sedgwick Directing Black List Script Space Oddity; Kyle Allen, Alexandra Shipp & Madeline Brewer To Star\".
