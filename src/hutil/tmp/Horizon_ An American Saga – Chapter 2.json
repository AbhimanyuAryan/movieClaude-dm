It began casting in February.[5] In April, Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema joined the production to distribute.[6] In a June interview, Costner stated he plans to make four movies out of the premise, and was looking to cast over 170 speaking roles.[7]\nIn August, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jamie Campbell Bower, Luke Wilson, Thomas Haden Church, Jena Malone, Alejandro Edda, Tatanka Means and Michael Rooker were cast in the film.[8][9][10][11] Isabelle Fuhrman, Ella Hunt, Jeff Fahey and Tom Payne would be amongst numerous casting announcements made throughout September.[12][13][14][15] In October, Will Patton, Owen Crow Shoe and Danny Huston were added to the cast.[16][17][18]\nFilming of at least the first installment began on August 29, 2022 in southern Utah,[8] concluding in November.[19] Filming of the second installment began by May 2023,[3] before concluding in the summer of that year.[20]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn a May 2023 interview, Costner expressed hope to have the first film released by Fall 2023.[4] In October, it was announced the film would release in two parts, with Chapter 1 releasing on June 28, 2024, and Chapter 2 on August 16, 2024.[21] Later that month, it was announced that K5 International, the recently relaunched international sales arm of K5 Media Group, would handle international sales on the film at the American Film Market.[22] In April 2024, it was announced that the first part of the film would premiere out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2024.[23]\n\nSequels[edit]\nIn June 2022, Costner stated he plans to make four Horizon films in total, shot back-to-back.[7] In November 2022, Costner confirmed that the first film had been completed, and that the second had been greenlit, set to be filmed in Spring 2023.[24] Production for the second film was commenced by April 2023, with Glynn Turman, Kathleen Quinlan and Giovanni Ribisi joining Kevin Costner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Ella Hunt, Will Patton, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman and Thomas Haden Church, who continue on from the first film. Director of photography J. Michael Muro, production designer Derek R. Hill, editor Miklos Wright and costume designer Lisa Lovaas would also return.[25] The second film finished production in Summer 2023, with the production of the third film being paused because of the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes.[26]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of films and television shows about the American Civil War\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"John Debney Scoring Kevin Costner's 'Horizon: An American Saga'\".
