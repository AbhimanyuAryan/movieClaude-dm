It stars Kevin Dillon, Bruce Willis, Gianni Capaldi, Brooke Butler, Leon, and Frank Grillo. The film was released on March 4, 2022, by Vertical Entertainment.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nConnor Connolly, a disgraced parole officer, becomes indebted to a local drug kingpin, Tyrone Pettis, after having no choice but to kill one of the latter's young enforcers (an \"asset\"). Upon having his pregnant wife Candice abducted by Pettis as leverage, Connor is forced to pull off a series of dangerous drug heists within twelve hours in order to pay the $2 million dollars he now owes. Connor recruits his old teammates to conduct the heists with him, rescue his kidnapped pregnant wife, and settle a score with the city's corrupt police chief Alston who had double-crossed them years ago in a botched hostage situation that led to the former team's disbandment. Alston is secretly in an uneasy alliance with Pettis, who has financed his rise to power. The team goes through with the heists, and confronts Pettis whilst rescuing Candice, before coming to a mutual understanding and engaging in one final heist in an attempt to disrupt Alston's criminal operations. In the end, Connor, Pettis, and Candice successfully flee the country, while Alston, having been recorded during the ongoing heist gunning down one of his subordinates who was catching onto his illicit activities, is arrested.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKevin Dillon as Connor Connolly, a disgraced parole officer and former member of a \"ghost\" squad\nBruce Willis as Alston, the police chief\nLeon as Tyrone Pettis, the local drug kingpin\nFrank Grillo as Brice Mason, the ex-captain of a \"ghost\" squad\nGianni Capaldi as Tim Connolly, Connor's brother, and a former member of a \"ghost\" squad\nBrooke Butler as Candice Connolly, Connor's pregnant wife\nJohnny Messner as Deputy Chief Schipp\nVernon Davis as Dwayne Miller, a former member of a \"ghost\" squad\nAlexander Kane as Steven Rogers, a former member of a \"ghost\" squad\nAspen Kennedy as Joaquin Smith\nMohamed Karim as Detective Reynolds, a police officer\nCurtis Nichouls as Spade, Pettis' right hand man\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography for A Day to Die began in Jackson, Mississippi in March 2021, as the first feature to be shot in the city in 2021.
