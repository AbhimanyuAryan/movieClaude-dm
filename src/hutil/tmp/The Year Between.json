Smith-Cameron, Steve Buscemi, Wyatt Oleff, Emily Robinson, Kyanna Simone, and Rajeev Jacob. The film follows Clemence (Heller), a maladjusted collegiate dropout with bipolar disorder, who returns home to her reticent family and attempts to juggle her fractured relationships along with the everyday pressures of \"adulting\".\nThe Year Between premiered at the Tribeca Festival on June 12, 2022,[1] where it was nominated for the Best U.S. Narrative Feature. After a minor festival tour, the film was subsequently released in the United States and Canada in limited theaters on March 3, 2023, to positive reviews, while simultaneously made available for streaming on Peacock and Hoopla.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn her sophomore year at college, Clemence Miller (Heller) has alienated everyone with her erratic behavior. After incurring a manic bout of bullying, her miserable roommate, Eliza (Blim), notifies the administration and her craft store proprietress mother, Sherri (Smith-Cameron), of Clemence's disparaging attitude and mood swings. This prompts Sherri to wrangle her daughter into quitting school and compel her to begrudgingly return home, whereupon she discovers her old bedroom has been converted into a home office. Instead, she'll be \"banished\" to the furnished basement.\nUpon visiting a psychiatrist (Buck), Clemence is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is prescribed a regimen of medication beginning with lithium to balance her oscillating mania and depression episodes, which will require experimental adjustments. Initially, she is defiant and reluctant, but an exasperated Sherri encourages her.\nMeanwhile, she receives a tepid welcome from the rest of the family. Her father, local schoolteacher Don (Buscemi), attempts to be relentlessly positive, while her younger siblings are far less enthused. Her sister, Carlin (Robinson), fears Clemence's attributes will be imparted unto her, and thus strives to achieve high ACT scores to prevent this. Her brother, Neil (Oleff), is trepidatious about being absorbed into Clemence's unstable orbit, and retains an ambivalent attitude when in her presence.\nUndeterred, Clemence begins attending sessions with a psychologist (Odom) and lands a job part-time at a thrift store. She forges a strained connection with co-worker Beth (Simone), and manages to stay sober from alcohol and illicit drugs. However, upon reconnecting with erstwhile partying pal, Ashik (Jacob), Clemence begins to jeopardize her progress and runs the risk of losing what little support she has left.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAlex Heller as Clemence Miller\nJ.

Heller was also a nominee for the Reel Women Direct Award for Excellence in Directing by a Woman. However, the latter award went to Christine Yoo for 26.2 to Life, while the former was won by Playing Through from Balbinka Korzeniowska.[12]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10.[13] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on four critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[14]\nMike McGranaghan of The Aisle Seat wrote, \"A personal pet peeve is movies that use mental illness as a \u201cquirky\u201d personality trait for their central characters....The Year Between deftly avoids all that. This is one of the most authentic depictions of bipolar disorder I've seen.\"[15] Dennis Harvey from Variety is equally effusive, praising Heller for maintaining a tonal balance of the subject matter: \"The result is a useful mix of the pseudo-random and finely honed that refuses to hand-wring over Clem\u2019s travails, yet simultaneously makes an upbeat case for her emerging from them intact \u2014 even if she\u2019ll never exactly be Miss Congeniality.\" He also lauds the performances from the cast, and stated, \"[The characters are] all amusing, yet free of caricature, and the prickly dynamics between them feel tart without being cynical.\"[16]\nNick Allen, a critic at RogerEbert.com, wrote in his 3\u00bd/4-star review, that \"Alex Heller pulls off a dazzling tonal high-wire act for her directorial debut\"; compliments the film's dialogue as \"naturally, wildly funny, without sugarcoating the issues it embraces\"; and concludes, \"\u2026that a daring dramedy like this can be made, and tactfully.\u2026It's proof of a major talent.\"[17] Steven Warner of In Review Online praised Buscemi and Smith-Cameron, both of whom he stated \"have arguably never delivered a bad performance in their entire careers\".[18]\nRendy Jones of Rendy Reviews had a mixed reception to the film, rating it 2\u00bd/5 stars. Jones applauded Heller's \"deadpan charisma\"; alluded to her having \"chemistry with her co-stars\", especially for her acting debut; and particularly complimenting the acting ensemble of Smith-Cameron, Buscemi, Robinson, and Oleff (who portray her mom, dad, sister, and brother, respectively). On the flipside, Jones had a bad reaction to the \"deplorably crass main character\" and took umbrage with the screenplay, evoking unfavorable comparisons to Lady Bird (2017). He felt it was \"too formulaic\u2026reminiscent of Judd Apatow's slacker comedies\".[19] In a more scathingly negative review, Carla Hay of Culture Mix lambasts the character of Clemence, calling her an \"emotional terrorist\", and summarizing, \"The misguided comedy/drama \u201cThe Year Between\u201d is an irritating slog that offensively uses bipolar disorder as an excuse for the central character to be cruel and toxic to everyone around her.\"[20]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\nNominee(s)\n\nResult\nRef.\n\n\n2022\n\nTribeca Festival\n\nFounders Award \u2014 Best U.S. Narrative Feature\n\nAlex Heller\n\nNominated\n\n[3]\n\n\nNashville Film Festival\n\nGrand Jury Prize \u2014 Best New Directors Feature\n\nWon\n\n[6]\n\n\nChicago International Film Festival\n\nAudience Choice Award \u2014 Best Feature (TIE) (with Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery)\n\nWon\n\n[8]\n\n\n2023\n\nCleveland International Film Festival\n\nReel Women Direct Award\n\nNominated\n\n[12]\n\n\nAmerican Independents Competition\n\nNominated\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Sayej, Nadja (June 15, 2022). \"Must-See Movies at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival\".
