Directed by Emma Westenberg in her feature length debut, it was written by Ruby Caster from an original story by Caster, Clara McGregor and Vera Bulder. It had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 11, 2023 under the title You Sing Loud, I Sing Louder, and was released by Vertical Entertainment on February 16, 2024.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nClara McGregor as Daughter\nEwan McGregor as Father\nKim Zimmer as Elsie\nJake Weary as Kip\nDevyn McDowell as Young Daughter\nVera Bulder as Tommy\nPremise[edit]\nA father secretly drives his estranged daughter to rehab after she overdoses, aware that she has inherited his addiction problems, and after he has started a new family elsewhere.[2]\n\nProduction[edit]\nChristine Vachon produced the film.[3] Clara McGregor produced, as well as wrote the story alongside Ruby Caster and Vera Bulder. The idea for the story drew on aspects of the McGregor's own father-daughter relationship, Ewan McGregor told Deadline Hollywood that the film \"can be very meta and still definitely be a work of fiction and not at all biographical... I don't suggest this is autobiographical, but there we were, playing father and daughter and we are that. You can\u2019t help but have that be in the room\". \nPrincipal photography took place in late 2021 lasting 22 days in New Mexico.[4][5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nUnder its original title You Sing Loud, I Sing Louder, the film had its premiere at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2023.[6] [7] In December 2023, Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film, now retitled Bleeding Love, and scheduled it for a theatrical release in the United States on February 16, 2024.[8] It is scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by Icon Film Distribution on March 29, 2024.[1]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 62% of 37 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Bleeding Love benefits from strong interplay between Ewan and Clara McGregor, although their efforts are somewhat undermined by a less than scintillating script.\"[9]\nTim Grierson of Screen Daily said the McGregors \"bring a weathered authenticity to this story\".[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Bleeding Love (15)\".
