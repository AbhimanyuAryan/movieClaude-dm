He wanders from place to place with only a suitcase and the drive to make just enough money to get to his next stop. His current perch is Los Angeles. He gets into a fight in a roadhouse bar when an someone tries to cheat him at poker and easily beats up a group of bullies.\nMax (Mekhi Phifer), an ex-con manager of fighters for an underground fight club, watches this sees in Duffy a lot of skill, potential, anger, and a need to prove himself. Max's brother, a veteran as well who committed suicide because he didn't have an outlet for his rage and isolation, was like Duffy. Max worries that Duffy could end up the same way. Max gives Duffy a chance to win some money for the both of them, as well as a temporary home with himself, his sister Rachel and her daughter. \nMax needs the money to repay Sage, one of the villains who runs a gym and the underground fights. Sage's boss is Ellen Ridgeway, a police detective who uses her official status to intimidate the entire criminal operation, keeping it under her control. Duffy wins the fight and the money but he becomes unintentionally entangled in a complicated web because it was Rachel's abusive boyfriend who had stolen the money from Sage and Ridgeway in the first place.\n\nCast[edit]\nFrank Grillo as Michael \"Duffy\" Duffield, a homeless veteran[2]\nMekhi Phifer as Max Bomer, an ex-con[2]\nJaime King as Ellen Ridgway, a police officer and Sage's boss[2]\nDermot Mulroney as Sage Parker, a crime boss[2]\nScott Adkins as Don 'The Reaper' Richter\nDonald Cerrone as Carter\nAmaury Nolasco Fosco\nJuJu Chan as Lynx\nJustin Furstenfeld as Stan 'The Man' Lazare\nErica Peeples as Rachel Bomer\nProduction[edit]\nIn January 2022, it was reported that Frank Grillo,  Mekhi Phifer, Scott Adkins and Dermot Mulroney were cast in the film.[3]\nThe following month, Justin Furstenfeld, Amaury Nolasco, Donald Cerrone, Jaime King, JuJu Chan, and Erica Peeples were reported to be cast.[4][5]\nPrincipal photography took place in Santa Clarita, California in February 2022.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nLights Out was released in the United States by Quiver Distribution on February 16, 2024.[2]\n\nReception[edit]\nThis section needs expansion with: Please add critical reviews.
