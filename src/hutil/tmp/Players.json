It stars Gina Rodriguez, Damon Wayans Jr., Joel Courtney, Augustus Prew, Liza Koshy, Ego Nwodim, Marin Hinkle, and Tom Ellis. It was released by Netflix on February 14, 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMack is a 33-year-old sports journalist in New York City who is known for her \u2018plays\u2019, complex deceptions to find hook-ups for herself and her friends - best friend Adam, co-worker Brannagan, and his brother Little. While she enjoys her life, she yearns for a more serious relationship. She hopes to find one in Nick, a sophisticated war correspondent who has just joined their newspaper. The two have sex, but Mack is disappointed to find that he only considers her a one-night stand. She convinces Adam to help her ensnare Nick. The foursome research Nick\u2019s habits and preferences, eventually devising a play called \u2018The Flurry\u2019.\nThe plan begins with Mack intentionally running into Nick, but ignoring him, attracting his attention. After finding out that he is going on a third date with another girl, the group - having also recruited the paper\u2019s secretary Ashley - schemes to call his date away with an emergency, allowing Mack to take his place. The two start dating, while Adam begins seeing a new girl, Claire. Nervous about dealing  She convinces Adam to run a play with her at brunch, who reluctantly agrees but cautions her to take the relationship more seriously. While at brunch, Mack and Adam demonstrate their natural chemistry and long history together, making Claire uncomfortable with their closeness.\nMack writes a feature about New Yorkers\u2019 favorite sports memories, asking both Adam and Nick to read a draft. While Adam immediately reads and loves the piece, Nick is slow to get to it while working on his latest manuscript. At a gala event where Nick is receiving a humanitarian award from UNICEF, Mack reveals that Nick has rewritten her piece entirely rather than giving feedback. Adam becomes upset at Nick\u2019s treatment of her and storms off. Mack and Nick fight about the piece that night, where Nick reveals that her job could be in jeopardy in the next round of layoffs at the paper. The two break up, and Mack submits her version of the story, which her editor loves, assigning her to work a Yankees game for the first time.\nAs the group - minus Adam - celebrates Mack\u2019s success, they see Claire with another man. After confronting her, she reveals that she broke up with Adam after their brunch, unbeknownst to the group. She tells Mack that they broke up because Claire could tell that Adam was in love with Mack; Mack is initially resistant, but eventually admits that she has feelings for him too. Adam avoids contact with Mack, but agrees to help Ashley surprise Little - who she has started dating - with tickets to the game that Mack is working. To Adam\u2019s surprise, he is actually the target of the play: letting Mack confess her love outside the stadium. The two share a kiss before Mack runs off to work the game.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nGina Rodriguez as Mack\nDamon Wayans Jr. as Adam\nTom Ellis as Nick\nAugustus Prew as Brannagan\nJoel Courtney as Little\nLiza Koshy as Ashley\nEgo Nwodim as Claire\nMarin Hinkle as Karen Kirk\nBrock O'Hurn as Brady Stratton\nProduction[edit]\nIt was reported in March 2021 that Gina Rodriguez, Damon Wayans Jr., and Tom Ellis would star in the film.[1] Players was produced by Marc Platt Productions and Campfire Studios.[1] Filming took place in New York City from July to September 2021.[2]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released by Netflix on February 14, 2024.[3][4]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 50% of 28 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10.
