The film stars Liam Neeson[6] as the brooding Mike McCann, and Laurence Fishburne as Jim Goldenrod with Benjamin Walker, Amber Midthunder, Marcus Thomas, Holt McCallany, Martin Sensmeier, Matt McCoy, and Matt Salinger in supporting roles. It marks Hensleigh's first film since 2011's Kill the Irishman. It follows a team of truck drivers on a dangerous mission over frozen lakes and winter roads to deliver a crucial component to save workers trapped in a collapsed diamond mine.[5] The film was digitally released by Netflix in the United States and Canada, and by Amazon Prime Video in the United Kingdom on June 25, 2021. The film received mixed reviews from critics. A sequel titled The Ice Road 2: Road to the Sky is in production.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAn explosion at a mine in Manitoba traps 26 miners. Mike McCann and his brother Gurty, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD and aphasia, work for a trucking company in North Dakota until Mike punches another trucker for making fun of Gurty's cognitive disability, and they are both fired. Mike hears about ice road truckers needed in Winnipeg, and they apply. Jim Goldenrod, another trucker, agrees to lead a rescue mission to deliver wellheads to the mine. He hires McCann and Gurty, along with a young Indigenous woman known only as Tantoo. Also joining the rescue mission is actuary Varnay, responsible for insurance risk assessment for Katka, the company which owns the mine. $200,000 is split between the four truckers, which will be redistributed among the survivors if anyone dies. Meanwhile, the miners are communicating with Katka executives using tap code, and Katka General Manager Sickle transmits a message that they plan to free the men by blasting a tunnel.\nThe team leaves for the mine with three wellheads. During the trip, Goldenrod's engine seizes. While attempting to repair it, the ice beneath his trailer breaks and his leg gets trapped. Knowing he can't escape, he convinces Tantoo to sever the strap attaching him to her truck, causing him to drown but saving the other two rigs and wellheads. In an attempt to flee the rapidly approaching pressure wave and cracking ice, the remaining two trucks fishtail and roll over, stopping the pressure wave.\nVarnay convinces Mike to accuse Tantoo of sabotaging Goldenrod's rig, but Tantoo reveals her brother Cody is amongst the miners. When they continue to interrogate her, she pulls out a pistol, but Gurty disarms her and ties her up. After the men right the trucks, Varnay locks Mike and Gurty in the back of their rig. Varnay is revealed to have been the one who sabotaged Goldenrod's rig, and knocks Tantoo unconscious. He rigs Mike's truck with dynamite and drives off with Tantoo, but Mike and Gurty escape from the trailer and throw the dynamite away just before it explodes. Varnay watches the explosion from afar, believing that Mike and Gurty are dead.\nWhile winching their trailer out of the ice, Gurty tries to warn Mike the winch will fail, but Mike starts the machine anyway. The winch snaps, causing Gurty and the trailer to fall into the water, but Mike rescues Gurty. Varnay meets with Sickle, telling him Mike and Gurty have died. Sickle instructs Varnay to get rid of Tantoo and the last remaining wellhead by making it seem Tantoo lost control and veered off a cliff. Varnay prepares to kill Tantoo, but is bitten by Gurty's pet rat Skeeter, enabling Tantoo to throw him out of the rig. Mike and Gurty arrive and kill the Katka contractors pursuing Tantoo.\nAfter Tantoo runs out of fuel due to Varnay disconnecting her fuel equalizer, he catches up to her, but Mike crashes his rig into Varnay's truck, sending it off a cliff. Varnay survives and creates an avalanche with dynamite. Mike and Gurty escape, but Tantoo is hit by snow and wounded by a branch. They uncouple her trailer, and drive off with the wellhead. Varnay pursues them in Tantoo's rig and begins ramming them. Mike boards Varnay's rig and both fall from the truck. After a struggle, Mike attempts to drive away, but Varnay climbs onto the rig. Mike knocks Varnay out, accelerates the rig, and jumps out, causing it to fall through the surface and kill Varnay. Meanwhile, Tantoo and Gurty cross a bridge not designed for the weight of the truck, and barely make it over before the bridge collapses. After crossing, the truck starts sliding backwards, and Gurty is crushed trying to prevent the truck from falling. Mike arrives and comforts a dying Gurty. Mike and Tantoo arrive just in time to rescue the miners. After learning the truth, the Katka CEO fires Sickle, who is arrested for his actions.\nThree months later, Tantoo is seen working in Goldenrod's garage as a mechanic. Mike visits her in his new gold truck, which he drives as an independent contractor to deliver sporting goods. As he drives off, he is seen tending to Skeeter and his license plate reads \"TRK TRK TRK\", in honor of Gurty's chosen name for a truck.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nLiam Neeson as Mike McCann\nLaurence Fishburne as Jim Goldenrod\nBenjamin Walker as Tom Varnay\nAmber Midthunder as Tantoo\nMarcus Thomas as Gurty McCann\nHolt McCallany as Ren\u00e9 Lampard\nMartin Sensmeier as miner Cody\nMatt McCoy as general manager Sickle\nMatt Salinger as CEO Thomason\nProduction[edit]\nFilming occurred in Winnipeg in February 2020.[7] Filming also occurred in \u00cele-des-Ch\u00eanes[8] and Gimli, Manitoba.[9][10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe Ice Road: Music from and Inspired by the Netflix FilmSoundtrack album by various artistsReleasedJune\u00a025,\u00a02021\u00a0(2021-06-25)GenreRock, country, Americana[11]LabelBig MachineSingles from  The Ice Road: Music from and Inspired by the Netflix Film \n\"I've Been Everywhere\"Released: May 21, 2021\n\"We Got Fight\"Released: May 26, 2021\n\n\nHensleigh asked Big Machine Records to create a multi-genre soundtrack album for the film.[11] Scott Borchetta, founder of the record label, wanted a psychobilly song as the basis for the soundtrack, and contacted Nikki Sixx to executively produce.[12] As a result, Nikki Sixx formed supergroup L.A. Rats along with Rob Zombie, John 5 and Tommy Clufetos, and they released a cover version of \"I've Been Everywhere\" as a single on May 21, 2021.[13] \"We Got Fight\", which was released on May 26, is Gary LeVox's debut solo single and plays over the film's end credits.[11][14] The album also contains covers of songs by Johnny Cash, The Cars, Dave Dudley, Hank Snow, and Kathy Mattea.[11]\n\nThe Ice Road: Music from and Inspired by the Netflix Film track listing[11][15]No.TitleArtistLength1.\"All I Do Is Drive\" (Johnny Cash cover)Jason Isbell2:502.\"Rubber Meets the Road\"Brantley Gilbert and Tyler Hubbard2:343.\"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\" (Kathy Mattea cover)Carly Pearce3:124.\"I've Been Everywhere\" (Hank Snow cover)L.A.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Liam Neeson remains a top-tier action hero; unfortunately, like a number of his recent genre outings, The Ice Road is a downhill trundle paved with predictability.\"[19] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[20]\nAlonso Duralde of the TheWrap criticized the \"downright laughable VFX\" and wrote: \"The Ice Road is so often inept and heavy-handed that not even the reliable presence of Liam Neeson can rescue it.\"[21]\n\nSequel[edit]\nIn April 2023, it was announced a sequel titled The Ice Road 2: Road to the Sky would be produced with star Liam Neeson and writer/director Jonathan Hensleigh set to return.[22] The sequel will follow Mike McCann  who honors his late brother's last wish by traveling to Nepal to scatter his ashes on Mt. Everest. While on a tour bus traversing the deadly 12,000\u00a0ft. terrain of the infamous Road to the Sky, Mike and his mountain guide encounter a group of Nepalese mercenaries and must fight not only to save themselves and the busload of innocent travelers, but also the local villagers\u2019 homeland.[22] The following month, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video was slated to pre-buy international rights (with the exception of Germany) for $17 million.[23]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ King, Randall (6 December 2019). \"Neeson to star in Manitoba-staged film\".
