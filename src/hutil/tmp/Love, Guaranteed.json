Her client Nick has had 986 dates through them with no luck finding love. The three dates she tries go decidedly wrong, and she also goes to secretly observe his 1000th date to make sure he's on the up and up.\nSusan and Nick attend a meeting with founder Tamara Taylor and her lawyers, who offer $100,000 to settle out of court, which they decline in lieu of a court date six weeks later. In preparation for their court appearance, Susan and Nick meet up to discuss their case, etc. and they start to show a mutual interest. One of the other lawyers, after seeing some photos of them taken by a private investigator, call Susan to advise her that a developing relationship with Nick could be considered nullifying their argument, as their meeting was due to Love, Guaranteed.\nSo, Susan chooses to spend the last two weeks before the court date avoiding him, to try to turn off their feelings. The day arrives, and Susan seems to be winning the case, cleverly managing to question the defense's prime witness, Nick's ex-fianc\u00e9e and supermodel, Arianna, before the defense. However, in the five-minute recess, Nick goes after Arianna to thank her, and she makes him realize that he loves Susan.\nNick returns to the courtroom, withdrawing his lawsuit on the grounds that he has fallen in love with his lawyer, who admits that she loves him too. Then they kiss passionately and make their relationship official. At the very end, Tamara Taylor offers to give them the money Nick asks for to open a pro bono physical therapy clinic in exchange for Susan and Nick being the image for Love, Guaranteed.\n\nCast[edit]\nRachael Leigh Cook as Susan Whitaker, a struggling attorney\nDamon Wayans Jr. as Nick Evans, Susan's well-heeled client\nCaitlin Howden as Melanie, Susan's sister\nJed Rees as Bill Jones\nLisa Durupt as Denise, Susan's legal assistant\nSean Amsing as Roberto, Susan's other legal assistant\nBrendan Taylor as Gideon, Melanie's husband and Susan's brother-in-law\nAlvin Sanders as Jerome\nKandyse McClure as Arianna, Nick's ex-fianc\u00e9e from two years ago\nHeather Graham as Tamara Taylor, the CEO of a dating site known as Love, Guaranteed\nQuynh Mi as Rita Wu, the date who talked about cats all night\nKallie Hu as Micah\nMilo Shandel as Dr. Rossmore\nSebastian Billingsley-Rodriguez as Oliver\nJason Burkart as Sparkletts Guy\nClaire Hesselgrave as Pam\nProduction[edit]\nThe film, set in Seattle, was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Locations used include the Gastown neighborhood, the Vancouver Art Gallery, and Stanley Park.[4]\nRachael Leigh Cook produced and stars in the film. The idea came from the real-life lawsuit brought against Molson Coors who claimed in their advertising that their beer was brewed using \"pure Rocky Mountain spring water.\" The lawsuit brought by Rachel Leigh Cook's character and her client in the film revolves around the unrealistic promises made by an online dating service.[2]\nThe film's original score was composed by Ryan Shore.\n\nReception[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on reviews from 25 critics, with an average rating of 5/10.[5] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[6]\nLisa Kennedy of Variety wrote: \"If likability is a trait you value, Love, Guaranteed delivers the undemanding pleasure of watching two fundamentally decent people tumble into fondness and then love.\"[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ N'Duka, Amanda (October 4, 2019). \"Rachael Leigh Cook & Damon Wayans Jr. To Topline Netflix Film 'Love, Guaranteed' With Cook Producing\".
