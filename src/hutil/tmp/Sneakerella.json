A re-imagining of the classic fairy tale Cinderella, the film stars Chosen Jacobs, Lexi Underwood, Devyn Nekoda, Bryan Terrell Clark, Kolton Stewart, Hayward Leach, Robyn Alomar, Yvonne Senat Jones, Juan Chioran, and John Salley.\nProduced by Disney Channel and Jane Startz Productions,[2] the film was released on Disney+ on May 13, 2022. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Sneakerella was nominated for 11 Children's and Family Emmy Awards at its inaugural ceremony, winning four awards including Outstanding Fiction Special and Outstanding Music Direction and Composition for a Live Action Program.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn Queens, teenage orphan El works in his late mother's shoe store \"Laces\", now run by his stepfather Trey, who overworks El instead of his stepbrothers Zelly and Stacy. El closes the store early to join his best friend and fellow sneakerhead Sami at the release of a new sneaker, where they meet a girl named Kira, who is impressed by El's insight into people from looking at their shoes. They miss the drop, but El shows Kira around his neighborhood, losing track of time as they fall for each other.\nEl is forced to rush back the store without a way to contact Kira, and is grounded by Trey, to his stepbrothers\u2019 delight. Kira returns home, and is revealed to be the daughter of sneaker mogul and former basketball star Darius King. Inspired by El, Kira suggests that her older sister Liv's shoe design is too \u201cbasic\u201d and convinces their father to let her look for another original design before the upcoming SneakerCon.\nLearning Kira's identity, Sami and El plan to sneak into King's charity gala to find her. Overwhelmed by running the business alone, Trey has decided to sell the store, leading El to draw on memories of his mother and create a unique shoe design, with inspiration and help from the neighborhood. The night of the gala, Zelly and Stacy trap El in the stockroom, but he is rescued by Gustavo, the community garden's magical caretaker. He provides El and Sami with outfits, tickets, and a classic convertible to reach the gala, but warns that they must leave by midnight.\nAt the event, El's custom-made shoes become the talk of the crowd, as Sami inadvertently spreads rumors that El is a sought-after independent designer. El reunites with Kira, who prepares to introduce him to her father as the designer everyone is talking about, but he and Sami are forced to flee at midnight. El loses one of his shoes on an escalator, which is found by Kira. Determined to track down the young mystery designer, Kira and Liv launch a viral campaign to find her \u201cprince\u201d.\nEl is unsure how to explain the truth to Kira, but Sami convinces him to reach out to her and arrange a meeting with her father. Realizing El's plan, Zelly and Stacy steal his other shoe, and El arrives just after his stepbrothers have informed Darius that El is merely a stock boy. El tries to explain himself, but Darius and Kira rebuke him for lying to them and send him away. As Trey prepares to close the store and move the family back to New Jersey, El throws away his designs, which are found by Gustavo.\nKira's mother suggests that her disappointment in El comes from trying too hard to meet her father's expectations, leading her to realize that she put just as much pressure on El herself. El wakes up to find a pair of sneakers from Gustavo, created from his design inspired by Kira. While Sami distracts his stepbrothers, El races to the King brand sneaker drop, where he and Kira apologize to each other.\nZelly and Stacy take off in the moving truck to confront El, and Sami urges Trey to see how unfairly he has been treating El since his mother's death. El convinces Darius of his good intentions, his talent, and his feelings for Kira, but is interrupted by his stepbrothers. Trey arrives, reining in his sons. He apologizes for being so hard on El, and asks for a second chance to be a real father to El, while Darius declares El his new designer.\nOne year later, El is in a relationship with Kira, and has transformed Laces into \u201cEl-evate\u201d, his own sneaker store pushing new and creative designs for all of Queens.\n\nCast[edit]\nChosen Jacobs plays the lead role of El and John Salley plays Darius King.\nChosen Jacobs as El, an aspirant sneaker designer from Queens who works as a stock boy in his late mother's shoe store.[2]\nLexi Underwood as Kira King, the beautiful and \"fiercely independent\" daughter of Darius King.[2]\nJohn Salley as Darius King, a sneaker tycoon and former basketball star.[2]\nYvonne Senat Jones as Denise King, Darius' wife.[2]\nDevyn Nekoda as Sami, El's openly lesbian best friend.[2]\nJuan Chioran as Gustavo, a friendly neighbor of El's.[2]\nRobyn Alomar as Liv, Kira's sister.[2]\nBryan Terrell Clark as Trey, El's overburdened stepfather who runs his late wife's shoe store, from whom El keeps his sneaker designer talents a secret.[2]\nKolton Stewart as Zelly, El's mean-spirited stepbrother from whom El keeps his sneaker designer talents a secret.[2]\nHayward Leach as Stacy, El's mean-spirited stepbrother and Zelly's brother from whom El keeps his sneaker designer talents a secret.[2]\nMekdes Teshome as Rosie, El's late mother who was loved by all.\nElia Press as Sneakerhead, always on the look out for the latest sneaker drop.[2]\nAndrew Ward as Sneaker Buster, a popular sneaker authenticator social media influencer.[2]\nWilliam Crockett as Sneak-Disser, a battle rapper known for his fresh kicks.[2]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nDirector Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum\nIn October, 2020, it was reported that Disney had begun production on Sneakerella, a modern re-imagining of the Cinderella story centered around sneaker culture, for Disney+.
