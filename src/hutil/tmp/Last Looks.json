It stars Charlie Hunnam, Mel Gibson, Morena Baccarin, Lucy Fry, Rupert Friend, Dominic Monaghan, Jacob Scipio and Clancy Brown.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAfter spending three years without human contact in a remote trailer, former Detective Charlie Waldo returns to Los Angeles to investigate the murder of actor Alistair Pinch\u2018s wife. Initially unwilling to take the case, he agrees to stay for one day after his ex-girlfriend Lorena went missing.\nAfter Alistair is arrested as the prime suspect, Charlie is lured back to his trailer by gangster Don Q, who claims that Lorena secretly stashed a \u201cmem\u201c in the trailer. He gives Charlie an ultimatum: to retrieve the mem within 24 hours. Charlie deduces that Alistair\u2018s wife was killed with one of his missing acting awards and that furniture at the crime scene was moved, casting doubts on the theory believed by the police. The police reveal to him that Lorena was seemingly killed over the mem and fixer Warren Gomes attempts to pressure him of the case.\nCharlie storms a party hosted by billionaire Darius Jamshidi, Gomes\u2018s employer. The next day, Charlie confronts Don Q over Lorena\u2018s murder, but is knocked out by his henchman. He received a message from Lorena, who faked her death and hid the \u201cmem\u201d, a memory stick, on his property. Charlie deduces that both men ordering attacks him, Jamshidi and gangsta rapper Swag Doggg, have kids in the same class as Alistair. He finds out that all three men had affairs with nymphomaniac school teacher Jayne White and attack him to keep it secret, while Alistair even got her pregnant.\nCharlie has now deduced the real killer: Wilson Sikorsky, Alistair\u2018s boss and his employer. He had an affair with Alistair\u2018s wife and killed her after she threatened to tell Alistair about the affair and force him to move back to England with her. He hired Charlie because he thought the disgraced detective wouldn\u2019t uncover the mystery and make Alistair take the Fall. After Gomes blackmailed him, he killed him, too. Sikorsky flees but is killed by Q, who reveals that on the memory stick is an epic poem he wrote. Charlie and Lorena reunite.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nCharlie Hunnam as Charlie Waldo\nMel Gibson as Alastair Pinch\nMorena Baccarin as Lorena Nascimento\nLucy Fry as Jayne White\nRupert Friend as Wilson Sikorsky\nDominic Monaghan as Warren Gomes\nJacob Scipio as Don Q\nClancy Brown as Big Jim Cuppy\nPaul Ben-Victor as Lieutenant Pete Conady\nMethod Man as Swag Dogggg\nDavid Pasquesi as Darius Jamshidi\nRobin Givens as Fontella Davis\nJosh McDermitt as Director\nSteve Coulter as Dr. Sebastian Hexter\nDeacon Randle as Nini\nRachel Hendrix as Valerie\nDavid Michael-Smith as Bailiff Canavan\nXen Sams as Allie Jamshidi\nProduction[edit]\nIn October 2018, Charlie Hunnam, Mel Gibson and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez joined the cast of the film, then titled Waldo, with Tim Kirkby directing from a screenplay by Howard Michael Gould.
