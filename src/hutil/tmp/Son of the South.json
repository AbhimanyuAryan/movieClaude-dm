Based on Bob Zellner's autobiography, The Wrong Side of Murder Creek: A White Southerner in the Freedom Movement, Lucas Till portrays Zellner, with Lex Scott Davis, Lucy Hale, Jake Abel, Shamier Anderson, Julia Ormond, Cedric the Entertainer and Brian Dennehy (in his final film role) appearing in supporting roles. Spike Lee serves as an executive producer.\nIt had its world premiere at the American Black Film Festival on August 26, 2020. It was released on February 5, 2021, by Clear Horizon Entertainment and Vertical Entertainment, receiving mixed reviews from critics, however praising Till's performance.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film opens on April 5, 1961, and focuses on Bob Zellner, who is the son of a Methodist minister, a senior attending all-White Huntingdon College in Montgomery, Alabama. Seeking information with which to write research papers on race relations, Zellner and four fellow students attend an event held in a Baptist Black church to mark the fifth anniversary of the 1955-1956 Montgomery bus boycott.\nThe event is conducted by Ralph Abernathy and Rosa Parks. When police arrive to arrest them, the White students evade arrest by fleeing through a back door. Dubbed the 'Huntingdon Five' in a newspaper, a cross is burned on the yard outside Zellner's room by the KKK. Zellner's klansman grandfather, J.O., warns him not to involve himself in the civil rights movement.\nWitnessing a mob attack on the Freedom Riders on May 19, 1961, Zellner helps Jessica Mitford get to safety.\nAt first a passive supporter of the movement, Zellner goes on to become SNCC's first White field secretary. Facing suspicion at first from black SNCC activists, he proves his bona fides by protesting alongside them, narrowly escaping a lynching by rural, white southerners while in McComb, Mississippi after participating with a march to the county courthouse on October 30, 1961.\nFollowing the murder of Herbert Lee, Zellner decides to leave the movement and continue his studies in the North. After a violent confrontation with a former \"friend,\" who organized his attempted lynching, Zellner firmly changes course and then commits himself to the movement. The film ends with a montage of Zellner's activism during the '60s on civil rights, including tribute to his mentor, the late John Lewis.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nLucas Till as Bob Zellner\nLucy Hale as Carol Anne\nLex Scott Davis as Joanne\nJulia Ormond as Virginia Durr\nCedric the Entertainer as Ralph Abernathy\nSharonne Lainer as Rosa Parks\nBrian Dennehy as J.O.
