Produced by Paramount Animation and Big Kid Pictures, and animated by DNEG Animation, the film features the voices of Keke Palmer, Michael Cera, and Bobby Cannavale.\nUnder the Boardwalk was released in select theaters on October 27, 2023, followed by a video-on-demand release on November 7.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nA community of land hermit crabs underneath a New Jersey beach boardwalk often play host to a community of sea hermit crabs that come to the land for vacation and both species of crabs can't stand each other. Armen, a timid land crab, is reluctant to go out and socialize due to how his parents died in a storm when he was a child and his rotting shell, inhabited by a fun-loving organism named Anemone, is the only reminder of them. However, three muscular crabs and Armen's friends, Bobby, Manny and Jimmy, drag him to a club owned by his uncle Bruno. The crabs get into a fight with an arrogant sea crab named Mako when Armen inadvertently bumps into Ramona, a tourist sea crab he fell in love with earlier. The land crabs get evicted as a result and Armen frustratedly takes his leave. As he is sulking by the seashore, Mako and his goons come to hassle him and steal his shell. Ramona intervenes, but she and Armen get swept away in a high tide that ruins the land crab civilization.\nArmen ends up in the far end of the beach and above the boardwalk where he is captured by a human collector to sell as a pet and is given an artificial shell to boot. He soon reunites with Ramona and together, they escape and work together to get back home. On their journey, they each share their insecurities, Armen for being too frightened to do anything besides stay in his shell and Ramona from wanting to get away from her overbearing mother Val, who expects perfection from her. Armen and Ramona's disappearances soon intensifies the rivalry between the land and sea crabs, mostly due to how Mako made up the story of how Armen tried to steal Ramona way from him. Bobby begins second-guessing his tendency to use physical force against his enemies and soon encounters Ramona's deaf sister Shelly looking for Ramona. However, as he walks her home, Val sends him away and when he tries to break up a fight between his friends and Mako's gang, he accidentally snaps off Mako's right arm. Mako vows revenge and claims that Armen is dead, giving them Armen's shell and a shell-shocked Anemone. The land crabs then declare war.\nAs Armen and Ramona fall in love, two of the crabs they met while at the pet shop begin judging them, making Armen feel hesitant about his feelings, much to Ramona's distress. Eventually, Ramona begins to get dehydrated and passes out, prompting Armen to carry her into the water, moving past the conflict between the land and sea crabs, who cease their fighting to see Armen carrying Ramona and dragging her into the water. Ramona wakes up and kisses Armen and they go back to the surface where Armen is praised for his heroism and Mako is outed as a liar. The land and sea crabs work past their differences with Mako giving Bobby a new shell as a peace offering and Armen giving his shell to a new crab who needs it more.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\n\nKeke Palmer as Ramona, a sea hermit crab and Armen's girlfriend\nMichael Cera as Armen, a land hermit crab and Ramona's boyfriend\nBobby Cannavale as Bobby, a land hermit crab, Mako's rival, and one of Armen's friends\nRussell Brand as Mako, a sea hermit crab, Bobby's rival and Ramona's ex-fianc\u00e9\nJohn Magaro as Manny, one of Bobby's friends\nJon Rudnitsky as Jimmy, one of Bobby's friends\nSteven Van Zandt as Bruno, Armen's uncle\nVanessa Bell Calloway as Val, Ramona and Shelly's mother\nShoshannah Stern as Shelly, Ramona's deaf sister who communicates through sign-language\nRon Funches as Anemone, Armen's best friend that lives within his shell\nMario Cantone as Mr. Cacciatore, Armen and Bobby's boss\nGideon Adlon as Denise\nLiza Tarbuck as Camille\nLesli Margherita as Etta / Bedazzled lady\nCassandra Scerbo as Loretta / Sea crab mom / Female land crab\nPhil LaMarr as Big Sal / Little Junior / Donny the bouncer / Bucket man / How You Doin' crab / Beach land crab\nSteven Schirripa as Mr. Marinara\nSharon Angela as Mrs. Marinara\nMrBeast as Hot Sauce Crab\nJoseph Balderrama as Chauncey\nSean Chiplock as Nigel\nDavid Soren as Yoga crab / Battle dad\nValarie Rae Miller as Townie crab / Neon crab / Female sea crab\nJim Cummings as Curly /  Local land crab\nMaureen Van Zandt as shop mother\nDavid Ian Salter as Unicorn crab\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2019, the film was announced under the name of Jersey Crabs, as part of Paramount Animation's upcoming slate, with Lorene Scafaria writing the screenplay and David Dobkin producing.[2] In July 2020, it was reported that David Soren was hired to direct the film, which was retitled Under the Boardwalk.[3][4] New Republic Pictures co-financed the film, but was not credited.[5] The animation was done by DNEG Animation in Montreal, with production underway by February 2021.[6] Production was done remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.[7] By June 3, 2022, the film was in post-production,[8] with production being completed by August 7, 2022.[9] Braam Jordaan was an animation consultant for the film.[10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn June 2021, it was reported that Sean Douglas would write original music for the film.[11] On May 23, 2022, scoring was announced to be underway.[7] In October 2023, it was announced that John Debney and Jonathan Sadoff had composed the film's score, with Sadoff co-writing the songs.[12] Sony Masterworks released a soundtrack EP for the film on November 3, 2023.[13]\n\nTrack listing[edit]\nAll songs are written by Douglas and Sadoff.[13]\n\nUnder the Boardwalk (Songs from the Motion Picture)No.TitlePerformer(s)Length1.\"Welcome to New Jersey\"Under the Boardwalk cast3:202.\"Anyone Else\"Keke PalmerMichael Cera2:003.\"Line in the Sand\"Cast2:334.\"Look Around\"PalmerCera2:175.\"More Than a Meathead\"Bobby Cannavale2:076.\"Going Out\"Cast2:28Total length:14:51\nRelease[edit]\nUnder the Boardwalk was released in select theaters on October 27, 2023, followed by a wide video-on-demand release on November 7.[14] It was released on DVD on December 19.[15] It was previously scheduled for release on July 22, 2022, but in January 2022, it was removed from the release schedule with Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank taking the date.[16] On July 26, 2023, it was announced that it would be released on Paramount+.[17] In October 2023, it was given for a limited theatrical release on its current date under the Nickelodeon Movies imprint, followed by its video-on-demand release.[18]\n\nReception[edit]\nBrian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com gave the film a rating of 6/10 stars, saying \"[I]t\u2019s not an especially strong picture, but as this type of entertainment goes, it has polish and some decent ideas to share with little ones concerning kindness and acceptance.\"[19]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Under The Boardwalk (PG)\".
