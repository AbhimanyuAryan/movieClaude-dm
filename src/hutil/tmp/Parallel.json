(February 2024)\nRachel Leishman from The Mary Sue gave the film a positive review writing: \"While the plot of Parallel can get complicated if you think too deeply about it, the film (written by Hodge and his brother and co-star Edwin Hodge alongside Jonathan Keasey) shines in the performances that Deadwyler and Aldis and Edwin Hodge bring to this family. Kourosh Ahari\u2019s simple direction lets us focus on what we want to believe in Vanessa\u2019s quest to make it back to her original timeline.\"[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Parallel (15)\".
