Set in the late 1980s, the film stars Taylor Russell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a pair of young cannibals who flee together on a road trip across the United States of America and develop feelings for each other. Michael Stuhlbarg, Andr\u00e9 Holland, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, David Gordon Green, Jessica Harper, Jake Horowitz, and Mark Rylance appear in supporting roles.\nBones and All had its world premiere at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2022, where it won the Silver Lion for best direction and the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Russell. The film was released theatrically in the United States on November 18, by United Artists Releasing, and elsewhere by Warner Bros. Pictures, with the exception of Italy, where it was distributed by Vision Distribution. The film received positive reviews, with critics praising the performances of Russell, Chalamet and Rylance, Guadagnino's direction, the cinematography, score, and fusion of genres. However, it underperformed at the box office, grossing $15.2 million against a production budget of $16\u201320 million.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis film's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn 1988, Maren Yearly is a teenage girl living in Frederick, Maryland, under the care of her father Frank. Having displayed cannibalistic tendencies ever since she murdered her babysitter at the age of three, Maren has evaded the consequences of her subsequent incidents over the years thanks to Frank's cover-ups, with the duo often relocating, even as he grew increasingly anguished over his daughter's apparent lack of remorse. He abandons her shortly after her eighteenth birthday (after yet another incident), leaving behind some cash, her birth certificate, and a message on a cassette tape, in which he states his hope that she will someday learn to overcome her urges.\nMaren decides to travel to Minnesota, listed as the birthplace of her mother Janelle, who left the family when Maren was still an infant. She is approached at a bus station by an eccentric man named Sully, who introduces himself as a fellow \"eater\" and teaches her that their kind can identify one another via scent. Maren is unsettled by Sully, as he displays creepy mannerisms. Sully informs Maren of a rule for eaters, abiding to never eat one another. She tentatively agrees. Sully tells Maren to follow him and leads her into a house owned by an elderly woman, who has collapsed and is near death. Maren is empathetic toward the dying woman while Sully does not reciprocate, saying they must satisfy their urges. Upset by the moral dilemma, Maren tearfully leaves, falling asleep in another room. The next morning, the woman has passed naturally: Sully has already begun eating her corpse. Though initially reluctant, Maren also begins to feed. Afterward, Sully shows her a rope made of the hair of his victims and expresses a predatory interest in Maren, which wholly disturbs her. As Sully cleans up, Maren flees the home, boarding a Greyhound bus. A deeply pained Sully stares her down as the bus drives by.  \nMaren heads toward Minnesota and makes a pit stop in Indiana on the way. While shoplifting at a corner store, Maren attempts to stop an intoxicated customer from harassing a woman. A young man, Lee, intervenes and baits the customer outside. Afterward, Maren spots Lee outside, coated in the man's blood. Both admit to recognizing each other's scents. Lee steals his victim's truck and, once the pair spends the night at the man's vacated house, offers to help Maren find her mother. They embark on a cross-country road trip, during which they fall in love. After a brief stay in Lee's hometown in Kentucky, Maren notices his unwillingness to discuss his past, including his father's absence and why he avoids being spotted around town. His younger sister Kayla chastises him for his irregular departures and arrivals.\nBriefly, both stop by a lake where two more eaters, Jake and Brad, arrive. Jake retells a story where he had eaten someone \"bones-and-all\", consuming them in their entirety. Brad is revealed to not be an eater but a cannibal by choice. Disgusted, Maren and Lee drive away. Later, Lee kills a theme-park staff member and both feast. At the man's address, Maren discovers he has a family, causing her to breakdown.\nMaren tracks down her maternal grandmother, Barbara, who has no prior knowledge of her existence. Barbara informs her that Janelle is not her biological child but was adopted after she was found abandoned behind a police station. Several years before, Janelle voluntarily admitted herself into a psychiatric hospital in Fergus Falls. There, Maren reunites with her, and is shocked to find her mother has self-cannibalized her own hands. A nurse hands Maren a letter from Janelle, which concludes with Janelle's belief that Maren would be better off dead than living as a \"monster\". Janelle attacks her before being restrained. Disturbed and unwilling to go down the same path as her mother, Maren leaves while Lee is asleep. She is soon accosted by Sully, who has been stalking her. She again turns down his offer to become companions, causing him to curse at her angrily before departing. Once he realizes Maren is gone, a devastated Lee decides to return home.\nMaren eventually makes her way back to Kentucky. She runs into Kayla, who reveals that, on the night of her and Lee's abusive father's disappearance, he beat them both before mysteriously vanishing while Kayla ran to get the police. Lee, the prime suspect of the matter, was cleared once it was proven the blood on him was his own. Maren and Lee reunite and rekindle their relationship, before deciding to travel westward with no clear destination in mind. Lee recounts the night, explaining that his father was an eater, having bitten him during the scuffle. Lee confesses he ate him, tearfully confessing to enjoying the thrill the act gave him. He asks Maren if she thinks he is a bad person, but she declares her love for him, and they decide to attempt to live a normal life together.\nSometime later, they are shown to be living happily in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as a regular, everyday couple. Maren comes home one day to find that their apartment has been broken into by Sully, who admits he has been following her since her rejection of him earlier. Sully threatens Maren at knifepoint, bemoaning her past rejections and his obsession with her. Lee arrives home and confronts Sully; a violent altercation ensues. The couple succeeds in killing Sully, but Lee is mortally wounded in the chest during the struggle. Maren finds Kayla's hair in Sully's rope, implying that Sully ate her. Heavily bleeding and ridden by guilt over Kayla, Lee pleads for Maren to eat his body as he dies, \"bones and all\". Maren frantically refuses at first, but eventually gives in, drinking blood from his open wound. Later, their apartment has become clean and bare. The film ends with a flashback of Maren and Lee out in the wilderness together.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nTop row: (left to right)  Taylor Russell, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Mark Rylance and Andr\u00e9 Holland\nBottom row: (left to right) Michael Stuhlbarg, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, David Gordon Green and Jessica Harper\n\nTaylor Russell as Maren Yearly\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Lee\nMark Rylance as Sully\nAndr\u00e9 Holland as Frank Yearly, Maren's father\nMichael Stuhlbarg as Jake, an Eater\nChlo\u00eb Sevigny as Janelle Kerns, Maren's mother\nDavid Gordon Green as Brad, a police officer who is a paraphilic cannibal but not an Eater\nJessica Harper as Barbara Kerns, Maren's grandmother\nJake Horowitz as Lance, a carnival worker whom Lee picks up\nKendle Coffey as Sherry\nAnna Cobb as Kayla, Lee's sister\nProduction[edit]\nOn April 8, 2019, it was announced that David Kajganich would adapt Camille DeAngelis's 2015 novel Bones & All for the screen, and that the film would be directed by Antonio Campos.[3] On January 28, 2021, it was announced that Taylor Russell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet would star in the film,[4] now to be directed by Luca Guadagnino.[5][6] Chalamet is also a producer on the film.[7] Filming began in May, by which time Mark Rylance, Michael Stuhlbarg, Andr\u00e9 Holland, Jessica Harper, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Francesca Scorsese, and David Gordon Green had joined the cast.[8][9] Shooting took place in Chillicothe, Ohio and Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes it Guadagnino's first film set and made in the United States.[10] Production was affected by break-ins that occurred for some of the crew's cars, leading to a request being submitted to Cincinnati City Council in late June to provide $50,000 for increased security.[11] While there was some criticism over the proposed use of taxpayer funds for a private enterprise, City Council ultimately passed a measure to grant the funds.[12][13] Filming wrapped in July 2021.[14]\nExecutive producers are Giovanni Corrado and Raffaella Viscardi. The film is fully financed by Italian companies: The Apartment (a Fremantle group society), 3 Marys, Memo, Tender Stories, Adler, Elafood, Elafilm, Manila, Serfis and Wise.[15]\nGuadagnino said that Bones and All is \"a very romantic story, about the impossibility of love and yet, the need for it. Even in extreme circumstances.\"[16] He also said that Chalamet and Russell have \"a gleaming power\" and are able to \"portray universal feelings\".[16]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe first teaser for Bones and All was released on August 10, 2022.[17] American artist Elizabeth Peyton was commissioned by director Luca Guadagnino to create a painting based on the film. The resulting painting, which she titled \"Kiss (Bones and All)\", was turned into the film's first poster, which was on display during the Venice International Film Festival, hanging on the 13th-century palace Ca' da Mosto in Venice.[18]\nThe official poster for the film was released on September 29, 2022, accompanied by its first trailer, which featured a rendition of Leonard Cohen's \"You Want It Darker\".[19][20] The song was chosen by lead actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.[21] Safeeyah Kazi of Collider called the trailer \"chilling\" and \"intense\".[22] Toussaint Egan of Polygon noted similarities to 1994's crime thriller Natural Born Killers.[23] Allegra Frank of The Daily Beast called it \"gorgeously bloody\", and praised it for not sharing too much information.[24] Lauren Milici of Total Film described the trailer as Let The Right One In meets Bonnie and Clyde.\"[25] An extended trailer was released on October 5, 2022.[26]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Bones and All (soundtrack)\nThe film's score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and was released on November 18, 2022, on Reznor's label The Null Corporation.[27][28] In an interview with TheWrap, Reznor and Ross explained that they had extensive discussions with Guadagnino regarding the score, who stated that he wanted it to be \"a melancholic elegy, an unending longing. It needs to be a character in the film, a part of the landscape\" and requested the use of acoustic guitars to complement the Americana visuals. Reznor and Ross noted how the duo had to experiment with a lot of different sounds before figuring out how the score would sit in the film and explained the creation of the film's original song \"(You Made It Feel) Like Home\", which stemmed from their personal connections to Russell and Chalamet's characters.[29]\n\nRelease[edit]\nBones and All had its world premiere at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2022, followed by screenings at the 60th New York Film Festival, 17th Fantastic Fest, 49th Telluride Film Festival, 2022 AFI Fest and 2022 BFI London Film Festival. It had a limited theatrical release beginning on November 18, 2022, before opening wide on November 23.[30][24]\n\nTheatrical[edit]\nIt is the first film to be acquired by United Artists Releasing and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures following its merger deal with Amazon on March 17, 2022. Vision Distribution released the film in Italy on November 23, 2022, in collaboration with Prime Video and Sky,[31] while Warner Bros. Pictures handled all other international territories through MGM and UAR under a new multi-year pact with the former beginning with this film.[32][33][34]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was available on rental PVOD on December 13, 2022.[35] It was released on Blu-ray and DVD, on January 31, 2023, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[36][37]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nBones and All grossed $7.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $7.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $15.2 million; it underperformed against a $16\u201320 million budget.[38][39][40][41]\nIn its limited opening weekend, Bones and All grossed $120,000 from five theaters.[42] The film expanded alongside Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Strange World, Devotion, and the wide expansion of The Fabelmans, and was projected to gross around $7\u20139 million from 2,727 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.[43] It made $921,000 on its first day, including $345,000 from Tuesday night previews.[44] It went on to debut to $2.7 million (including $3.5 million over the five days), finishing in eighth.[45] In its third weekend of release, the film made $1.2 million.[46] Its underperformance in the United States was attributed to the increasing decline of interest in prestige films by the general public in a moviegoing environment altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being a film of the horror genre, which saw a surge in popularity during the summer with the releases of Nope, Barbarian and Smile.[47][48]\nThe film debuted first at the Italian box office, grossing a total of \u20ac109.036 (USD$113,643).[49]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nLuca Guadagnino received praise for his direction.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 286 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Although its subject matter may be hard to stomach, Bones and All proves a deeply romantic and thought-provoking treat.\"[50] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[51] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 71%, including an average three out of five stars.[45]\nReviewing the film following its premiere at Venice, where it received a 10-minute standing ovation, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it an \"extravagant and outrageous movie: scary, nasty and startling in its warped romantic idealism\" and gave the film a perfect rating of 5 stars.[52] Stephanie Zacharek, in her review for Time, wrote \"Bones and All is fastidiously romantic. It's so carefully made, and so lovely to look at, even at its grisliest\", praising the direction and cast performances, particularly Russell's.[53] Taylor Russell, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Mark Rylance have received acclaim for their performances with critics praising Russell and Chalamet's chemistry together. Bloody Disgusting called the duo \"profound\" and \"touching and genuine\".[54] The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney also praised the duo, adding their performances are \"unforced and underplayed to subtly stirring effect,\" while calling the film \"strangely affecting, even poetic\" and commending the direction and cinematography.[55]\nLeila Latif in her review for IndieWire wrote, \"Bones & All is fundamentally a beautifully realized and devastating, tragic romance which at multiple moments would have Chekhov himself weeping as the trigger is pulled.\"[56] Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair called it an \"alternately plodding and engrossing YA road movie\" praising the cast performances, but ultimately found the film unsatisfactory, writing \"Bones and All has its merits, but the film is only a decent side dish at the feast of Guadagnino.\"[57] Writing for Sight & Sound, John Bleasdale described it as \"wryly funny, gleefully entertaining and oddly touching\" and praised the direction, cinematography, score, and cast performances.[58] Comparing it to Call Me by Your Name, Selina Sondermann wrote \"like two sides of the same coin \u2013 both cunningly display the love we find for ourselves when we are allowed to truly love another person, bones and all.\"[59]\n\"There's real pleasure in Bones and All, an insistent sweetness that somehow both nourishes and cleanses away the horror\" wrote Justin Chang in his review for the Los Angeles Times.[60] Clint Worthington Flow of Consequence described the film as \"an oddly sweet\u2014presumably a little coppery, too, due to all the blood\u2014alchemy of love and murder\" and compared it to Badlands (1973) and Bonnie and Clyde (1967), with their tales of \"lovers skirting human morality and forging their own sense of paradise with each other\".[61] In one unenthusiastic review, Slant's Keith Uhlich criticized the screenplay, direction, and cast performances, concluding: \"Straining to be a YA spin on Trouble Every Day, Bones and All barely eclipses Twilight.\"[62] Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, provided a firmly negative review, criticizing the use of gore by saying \"the problem is [cannibalism] can\u2019t stay a metaphor\" and \"Guadagnino has a choice, whether to be an artist or just the maker of artistically rendered, conscientiously realized garbage.\"[63]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\nAccolades for Bones and All\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nVenice Film Festival\n\nSeptember 10, 2022\n\nGolden
