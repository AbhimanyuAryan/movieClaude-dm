Due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, filming for animated characters began in July 2023 in Surrey, England, while filming with physical actors began in November of that year in London, with production concluding by March 2024. The film will draw inspiration from the video games Sonic Adventure 2 (2001) and Shadow the Hedgehog (2005).\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is scheduled to be theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on December 20, 2024.\n\n\nCast\nVoice cast\nBen Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog: An anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds.[3]\nColleen O'Shaughnessey as Miles \"Tails\" Prower: An anthropomorphic yellow-orange fox who can fly with his twin-tails.[3]\nIdris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna: A hot-headed and serious anthropomorphic red echidna warrior with super strength.[3]\nKeanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog: An anthropomorphic red-striped black hedgehog resulting from a secret government program called Project Shadow.[4]\nLive-action cast\nJames Marsden as Tom Wachowski, the adoptive father of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and the sheriff of Green Hills, Montana.[3]\nTika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski, Tom's wife, the adoptive mother of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and the local veterinarian of Green Hills.[3]\nJim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, a mad scientist and Sonic's arch-nemesis who he often refers to as \"Eggman\".[3]\nLee Majdoub as Agent Stone, Robotnik's assistant.[3]\nTom Butler as Commander Walters, the former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is the leader of the military organization Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.).[3]\nAlyla Browne as Maria[5]\nAdditionally, Krysten Ritter, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez, James Wolk, and Jorma Taccone were cast in undisclosed roles.[3]\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn February 2022, Sega Sammy Group and Paramount Pictures had been in development of a third Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) film after Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022).
