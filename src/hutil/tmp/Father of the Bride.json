It serves as a reimagining of the titular 1950 and 1991 movies, and the sixth overall installment in the Father of the Bride franchise. The film stars Andy Garc\u00eda, Gloria Estefan, Adria Arjona, Isabela Merced, Diego Boneta, and Chloe Fineman. It is the third filmed version of the story, after the original 1950 film and the 1991 remake. Produced by Plan B Entertainment, it was released on June 16, 2022, by Warner Bros. Pictures and HBO Max.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nRenowned architect Billy Herrera and his wife Ingrid are a Miami-based Cuban-American couple with two daughters, recent law school graduate Sofia and rebellious aspiring fashion designer Cora.\nAt couples' counseling, Ingrid tells Billy that she has had enough of his workaholic attitude and stubbornness and wants a divorce; their counselor tells them to tell their daughters right away. Ingrid wants to announce it later that day after Sofia arrives for a visit, but Sofia first announces that she is engaged to be married to fellow lawyer Adan Castillo and that they want to marry in one month.\nBilly and Ingrid agree to keep their divorce a secret until after the wedding. He is hesitant about Sofia's nuptials and her desire to move to Mexico with Adan to work at a non-profit instead of remaining in the United States.\nBilly disagrees with the couple as he wants a big, traditional Cuban wedding while Sofia and Adan want a smaller ceremony. Meanwhile, Sofia asks Cora to make her wedding gown and her bridesmaids' dresses, disgruntling their eccentric wedding planner Natalie Vance.\nAdan's wealthy father Hernan and the rest of his family arrive in Miami. He and Billy disagree further on the cost and scale of the wedding; Hernan offends him by offering to pay for what Billy cannot afford. He then throws a lavish engagement party on his yacht instead.\nHernan has also obtained a lavish mansion on a Miami island and offers to host the wedding there, causing a shouting match between him and Billy, who admits his dislike of Adan and his family. Billy appeases Sofia at her dress fitting and confides the divorce to Adan at the latter's bachelor party.\nA storm warning threatens the upcoming ceremony. The families proceed to the wedding rehearsal, where Cora overhears Billy talking about the divorce to his cousin Junior and immediately breaks the news to the rest of the guests. Sofia is disgusted that her parents and Adan have been hiding it from her, but reconciles once more with her father and agrees to push through with the wedding. That stormy night, the Herrera family spends the night together.\nThe next day, the weather has cleared, but the storm has collapsed the only bridge to the wedding venue and has destroyed much of the set-up. The Herreras and Castillos pool their resources to throw the wedding last-minute at the Herrera home, with Natalie officiating. Sofia and Adan marry with Billy's full approval, while Billy and Ingrid rekindle their romance.\n\nCast[edit]\nAndy Garc\u00eda as Billy Herrera\nGloria Estefan as Ingrid Herrera\nEmily Estefan as young Ingrid Herrera [3]\nAdria Arjona as Sofia Herrera\nIsabela Merced as Cora Herrera\nDiego Boneta as Adan Castillo\nChloe Fineman as Natalie Vance\nAna Fabrega as Vanessa\nEnrique Murciano as Junior\nLaura Harring as Marcela Castillo\nRuben Rabasa as Tio Walter\nPedro Dami\u00e1n as Hernan Castillo\nMatt Walsh as Dr. Gary Saeger\nMacarena Achaga as Julieta Castiilo\nCasey Thomas Brown as Kyler\nMarta Velasco as Caridad \"Chi Chi\" Gonzalez\nSean Patrick Dawson as Junior Jr.\nHo-Kwan Tse as Huan\nAngela Alvarez - as Tia Pili\nProduction[edit]\nIn September 2020, it was announced that a Latin adaptation of Father of the Bride centred around Cuban-Americans is in development at Warner Bros.
