It stars Sidney Flanigan (in her acting debut), Talia Ryder, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold, and Sharon Van Etten. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2020. It was also selected to compete for the Golden Bear in the main competition section at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize.[4][5][6] The film was released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Focus Features. It received widespread acclaim from critics, with praise for Flanigan's performance and Hittman's direction and screenplay.[7][8]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nSeventeen-year-old Autumn Callahan suspects she is pregnant and goes to a crisis pregnancy center. At the center, she takes a drugstore test that confirms she is pregnant. She is told she is 10 weeks along, given literature on adoption, and shown an anti-abortion video. After learning that she cannot get an abortion in Pennsylvania without parental consent, she tries to induce a miscarriage by swallowing pills and punching herself in the stomach. When those methods fail, she tells her cousin, Skylar, that she is pregnant. Skylar steals cash from the grocery store where they work, and the two buy bus tickets to New York City. On the bus they meet Jasper, a young man persistently interested in Skylar even though she tries to blow him off.\nAt a Planned Parenthood clinic in Brooklyn, Autumn learns that the crisis pregnancy center lied to her about how far along she was and that she is actually 18 weeks pregnant. Though she is still able to get an abortion, she must go to a Manhattan clinic the next morning to have it performed. Autumn and Skylar spend an uncomfortable night riding the subway and playing games at an arcade. The next morning at the clinic, Autumn learns that a second-trimester abortion is a two-day procedure and that paying for it will take most of her funds. The counselor also asks her a series of questions about her sexual partners that reveal that Autumn's partners have been physically and sexually abusive.\nOut of money, Skylar realizes the two have no way of going home. As Autumn asks Skylar not to call either of their mothers, Skylar reaches out to Jasper, who takes them bowling and to karaoke. At the end of the night, Skylar asks Jasper to lend them money for their bus tickets, and he agrees. Skylar leaves with Jasper to find an ATM, and Autumn later goes looking for them. She finds them kissing. Realizing Skylar is only doing it for the loan, Autumn discreetly grabs Skylar's hand to comfort her.\nIn the morning, Autumn goes to her appointment and has the abortion. Autumn and Skylar go to a restaurant, where Skylar asks her questions about the procedure, which Autumn answers tersely. The two ride a bus back to Pennsylvania.\n\nCast[edit]\nSidney Flanigan as Autumn Callahan\nTalia Ryder as Skylar\nTh\u00e9odore Pellerin as Jasper\nRyan Eggold as Ted\nSharon Van Etten as Autumn's mother\nKelly Chapman as Social Worker\nKim Rios Lin as Anesthesiologist\nDrew Seltzer as Manager Rick\nCarolina Espiro as Financial Advisor\nProduction[edit]\nIn April 2019, it was announced that Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold and Sharon Van Etten had joined the cast of the film, with Eliza Hittman directing from a screenplay she wrote. Adele Romanski and Sara Murphy produced the film under their Pastel Productions banner, while Rose Garnett, Tim Headington, Elika Portnoy and Alex Orlovsky executive produced the film under their BBC Films and Tango Entertainment banners, respectively. Focus Features was slated to distribute.[9]\nThe film shot for 29 days in February and March 2019, in New York City and Shamokin, Pennsylvania.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2020.[11] It was released in the United States on March 13, 2020.[12] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was released on video on demand on April 3, 2020.[13] Focus debated re-releasing the film theatrically but was concerned about competition once theaters reopened.[14] It was released through video on demand in the United Kingdom on May 13, 2020, after being initially planned for a theatrical release.[15]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn theaters, Never Rarely Sometimes Always grossed $891,527.[16]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 99% based on 238 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Powerfully acted and directed, Never Rarely Sometimes Always reaffirms writer-director Eliza Hittman as a filmmaker of uncommon sensitivity and grace.\"[7] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[8]\nCritics praised the film for its approach to visual storytelling and naturalistic acting, particularly its avoidance of polemic to focus on the lives of and the bond between its two lead characters. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"What makes Never Rarely Sometimes Always so forceful\u2014and certainly the most searingly confrontational American drama about abortion rights in recent memory\u2014is its quality of understatement, its determination to build its argument not didactically but cinematically.\"[17] Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair wrote, \"It's rare that the topic of abortion gets such a empathetic and holistic film treatment: passionate but unsentimental, principled without any predetermined moral.\u201d[18] Chang concluded, \"if the picture Hittman paints is stirringly bleak, it is not without its passages of tentative hope, even grace.\"[17]\nKaren Han of Polygon wrote, \"The slow build-up\u2014and Autumn and Skylar's stoicism through it all\u2014makes it all the more affecting when the reasoning behind the film's title is revealed.\"[19]\nNaomi Fry of The New Yorker wrote, \"In its profound sensitivity to everyday detail, Never Rarely Sometimes Always makes the viewer aware of the mundane challenges that dog every step its heroines manage to take along that path\u2014from the large, cheap suitcase bumped along with difficulty on subway steps, to the dwindling-down-to-nothing funds in a secreted-away pouch, to the flutter-lidded, late-night dozes taken on the subway, in lieu of a place to stay, waiting out the hours.\"[20]\nCritic Mark Kermode gave the film a 5-star rating and wrote, \"Perfectly pitched and sensitively played, this is truthful, powerful and profoundly moving fare from a film-maker at the very top of her game\" and added the film \"is perhaps best described as a perfectly observed portrait of female friendship; a coming-of-age story with road-movie inflections, piercingly honest and deeply affecting.\"[21] Kermode also lauded cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart, \"who here manages to capture moments of intense intimacy in unobtrusive fashion. Through her camera, we become both observers and participants\u2014watching these young women's lives but also empathetically experiencing their shared journeys.\"[21]\nIn 2023, it ranked 42nd on The Hollywood Reporter's list of \"The 50 Best Movies of the 21st Century So Far\". The Reporter  wrote that while the COVID-19 pandemic affected the film's theatrical release, its artistic impact on independent cinema prevailed, its relevance and resonance still enduring even after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.[22] It also ranked 15th on Collider's list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far\". Collider called it \"one of the most excruciating viewings of the decade\".[23]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nSundance Film Festival\n\nFebruary 1, 2020\n\nU.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award: Neo-Realism\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nWon\n\n[24]\n\n\nU.S. Dramatic Competition Grand Jury Prize\n\nNominated\n\n\nBerlin International Film Festival\n\nMarch 1, 2020\n\nGolden Bear\n\nNominated\n\n[25]\n\n\nSilver Bear Grand Jury Prize\n\nWon\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association Midseason Awards\n\nJuly 2, 2020\n\nBest Picture\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Female Director\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nNominated\n\n\nBoston Society of Film Critics Awards\n\nDecember 13, 2020\n\nBest Actress\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nWon\n\n[27]\n\n\nIndieWire Critics Poll\n\nDecember 14, 2020\n\nBest Film\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nRunner-up\n\n[28]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nEliza Hittman\n\n3rd Place\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart\n\n5th Place\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nEliza Hittman\n\n3rd Place\n\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Awards\n\nDecember 18, 2020\n\nBest Actress\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nWon\n\n[29]\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nWon\n\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association\n\nDecember 20, 2020\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nRunner-up\n\n[30]\n\n\nFlorida Film Critics Circle\n\nDecember 21, 2020\n\nBreakout Award\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nWon\n\n[31]\n\n\nChicago Film Critics Association\n\nDecember 21, 2020\n\nMost Promising Performer\n\nWon\n\n[32]\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nWon\n\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists\n\nJanuary 4, 2021\n\nBest Film\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nNominated\n\n[33]\n\n\nBest Woman Director\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Woman's Screenwriter\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Woman's Breakthrough Performance\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nWon\n\n\nNational Society of Film Critics\n\nJanuary 9, 2021\n\nBest Actress\n\n3rd Place\n\n[34]\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Film\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\n3rd Place\n\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society Awards\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nBreakthrough Artist\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nGotham Awards\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nBest Feature\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nNominated\n\n[36]\n\n\nBreakthrough Actor\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nNominated\n\n\nSt. Louis Film Critics Association Awards\n\nJanuary 17, 2021\n\nBest Scene\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area Film Critics Circle\n\nJanuary 18, 2021\n\nBest Picture\n\nNominated\n\n[38]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nNominated\n\n\nHouston Film Critics Society\n\nJanuary 18, 2021\n\nBest Picture\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nNominated\n\n[39]\n\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nNominated\n\n\nOnline Film Critics Society\n\nJanuary 25, 2021\n\nBest Picture\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\n4th Place\n\n[40][41]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nTalia Ryder\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nEliza Hittman\n\nNominated\n\n\nNational Board of Review\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n\nTop 10 Independent Films\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nWon\n\n[42]\n\n\nBreakthrough Performance\n\nSidney Flanigan\n\nWon\n\n\nNew York Film Critics Online\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n\nTop 10 Films\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nWon\n\n[43]\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nBest Original Song in an Independent Film\n\nSharon Van Etten (for \"Staring At A Mountain\")\n\nNominated\n\n[44]\n\n\nWashington D.C.
