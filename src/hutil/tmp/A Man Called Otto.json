It is a remake of the 2015 Swedish film A Man Called Ove, which was based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Fredrik Backman. The film stars Tom Hanks in the title role, with Mariana Trevi\u00f1o, Rachel Keller, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo in supporting roles. The plot follows a bitter old man who reluctantly gets involved in the lives of his neighbors.\nA Man Called Otto began a limited theatrical release on December 29, 2022, before a wide release in the United States on January 13, 2023, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $113 million worldwide against a $50 million production budget.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOtto Anderson is a 63-year-old widower, living in a rowhouse in suburban Pittsburgh. Six months after losing his wife Sonya, a schoolteacher, Otto has become a cynical, fastidious curmudgeon. Pushed into retirement from his job at a steel plant, he cancels his utilities and plans to kill himself to join his late wife.\nPreparing to hang himself, Otto is interrupted by the arrival of new neighbors: pregnant Marisol, her husband Tommy, and their daughters Abby and Luna, who try to befriend him. When he attempts suicide, the noose collapses from the ceiling, so he visits Sonya's grave, and has flashbacks to their past: as a young man, he was rejected from the army due to his hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and met Sonya on a train, where she lent him a 1964 silver quarter he has kept ever since.\nOtto helps his neighbor Anita with her radiators, despite holding a grudge against her husband Reuben, a non-responsive stroke survivor. Otto attempts suicide again via carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage, thinking back on his and Sonya's courtship, but he is interrupted by Marisol when Tommy breaks his leg after borrowing Otto's ladder. Otto reluctantly drives Marisol and the children to the hospital, where he assaults a clown for taking his special quarter during a magic trick.\nWhile waiting on a train platform for another suicide attempt, Otto remembers his graduation from engineering school, when he asked Sonya to marry him. He saves an older man who fell onto the tracks and lets himself be pulled to safety at the last second. When his allergic neighbor Jimmy rescues a stray cat, Otto reluctantly adopts it. He confronts a teenager named Malcolm for delivering unwanted advertising circulars, and the boy recognizes Otto as his former teacher's husband, recounting that Sonya supported him as a transgender student.\nAnnoyed by Marisol's inability to drive, Otto gives her lessons. They visit Sonya's favorite bakery, where Otto explains that Anita and Sonya were best friends, but he and Reuben grew apart over rivalries and trivialities such as loyalties to different car manufacturers, culminating in Reuben's \"coup\" replacing Otto as chair of the neighborhood association. Otto babysits Abby and Luna while Marisol and Tommy spend a night out together, and befriends Malcolm, helping to fix his bicycle.\nOtto dodges social media journalist Sharie Kenzie after a video of the incident at the train station goes viral. Unwilling to come to terms with Sonya's death, Otto lashes out at Marisol and an agent for Dye & Merika, a real estate company trying to buy up the neighborhood. He prepares to commit suicide by shotgun, remembering the bus crash on a romantic trip to Niagara Falls that caused a pregnant Sonya to lose her baby and become a paraplegic. Malcolm, who was kicked out by his father, knocks on the door, and Otto lets him stay the night.\nOtto learns that Dye and Merika are conspiring with the estranged son of Reuben and Anita. They are leveraging Anita's secret Parkinson's diagnosis to buy their house and put Reuben in their nursing home. He resolves to fight them and asks for Marisol's help, finally explaining Sonya's stillbirth and disability, his frustration at the inaccessibility of the Dye & Merika housing development, and how he was voted out as association chair after a heated confrontation with the company. When Dye & Merika staff arrive to take Reuben, the neighbors band together to stop them, with Kenzie exposing their illegal access to Anita and Otto's medical records.\nOtto collapses and he is taken to the hospital, identifying Marisol as his next of kin. She is amused to learn \"his heart is too big\", then goes into labor and gives birth to a son, Marco. Otto gives Marisol and Tommy the cradle he built when Sonya was pregnant, gives his car to Malcolm, and grows closer to his neighbors. \nThree years later, following a snowfall, Tommy notices Otto has not shoveled his walkway as he normally would. He and Marisol enter his house and find that Otto has died of heart failure. They also find a letter to Marisol bequeathing his home, savings, new truck, and cat. Following his wishes for a funeral, the neighbors gather to remember Otto.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nTom Hanks as Otto Anderson\nTruman Hanks as young Otto\nMariana Trevi\u00f1o as Marisol\nRachel Keller as Sonya\nManuel Garcia-Rulfo as Tommy\nMike Birbiglia as the Dye & Merika real estate agent\nCameron Britton as Jimmy\nMack Bayda as Malcolm\nJuanita Jennings as Anita\nPeter Lawson Jones as Reuben\nKelly Lamor Wilson as Shari Kenzie\nIn addition, Christiana Montoya and Alessandra Perez appear as Luna and Abbie, respectively.
