The film is the fifth installment in the franchise, and is a continuation of the MTV series Teen Wolf. The movie includes most of the cast reprising their roles, including Tyler Posey, Crystal Reed, Tyler Hoechlin, Holland Roden, Colton Haynes, Shelley Hennig, Dylan Sprayberry, Linden Ashby, Melissa Ponzio, and JR Bourne. It follows werewolf Scott McCall (Posey) as he protects his California town from an old threat.\nThe film was released on Paramount+ on January 26, 2023.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nFifteen years after leaving Beacon Hills, Scott now runs an animal shelter in Los Angeles, adjoined to Deaton's new clinic, and is single. Lydia works at an energy company in San Francisco and has broken up with Stiles after receiving a recurring vision of his death. Derek has a 15-year-old son named Eli, and runs an auto repair shop with Malia and Peter. Mason has joined the Beacon Hills police force. Liam lives in Japan and works at a restaurant with Hikari Zhang, a kitsune, where they guard the urn containing the Nogitsune. A hooded figure attacks the restaurant and frees the Nogitsune.\nThe figure sets numerous fires in the Beacon Hills forest, while Scott, Lydia and Chris receive visions of Allison, who had died by the Oni's hand.[a] They theorize her soul is trapped in bardo and cannot move on until they perform a ritual. They return to Beacon Hills along with Jackson for the ritual at the Nemeton, which unexpectedly resurrects Allison. She awakens with amnesia, not recognizing Scott and retaining only fragmented memories of her family's feud with Derek. She attacks Scott and flees the hospital.\nDeaton realizes the Nogitsune has been possessing Chris and causing the visions of Allison in order to trick Scott's pack into bringing her back from the dead. The Nogitsune uses the Nemeton's power to physically manifest and creates nine Oni. It approaches Allison, claiming that Scott destroyed her family. Allison attacks Derek and hunts Scott and Eli until Scott lets her stab him with a wolfsbane-coated dagger. She takes him to the town's stadium to use him as bait for the rest of his pack. He manages to trigger more of her memories, and she forms a truce with him against the Nogitsune.\nThe Nogitsune abducts Liam, Hikari, Derek, Eli, Noah, Mason and Deaton, and holds them hostage in an illusionary bardo. Lydia and Jackson examine the forest fires and realize that rowan trees were burned in order to produce mountain ash. The culprit is Adrian Harris, who has been in hiding since his apparent murder,[b] blaming Scott's pack for his misfortunes and plotting revenge. Harris surrounds the stadium with mountain ash and forces Lydia to watch her friends' plight so the Nogitsune can feed on her pain. Lydia produces a banshee scream that causes Allison to remember her past upon hearing it. Scott persuades the Nogitsune to let everyone go if Allison executes him. She reluctantly shoots him, but Hikari's kitsune spirit shields him from harm. Parrish burns through the mountain ash, and he, Chris, Melissa, and the others join the pack in bardo. The reunited pack kill the Oni while Scott, Derek and Eli overpower the Nogitsune. Derek restrains it until Parrish incinerates them both. Derek's eyes turn red in his final moments, becoming a true Alpha through his act of self-sacrifice. Allison reunites with Scott and her friends.\nAt Derek's funeral, Noah bequeaths ownership of Stiles' Jeep to Eli. Scott resumes his relationship with Allison and plans to eventually adopt Eli. Parrish has Harris committed to Eichen House.\n\nCast[edit]\nSee also: List of Teen Wolf characters\nThe principal cast of Teen Wolf: The Movie includes (top row, left to right) Tyler Posey, Crystal Reed, Holland Roden, Shelley Hennig, (bottom row, left to right) JR Bourne, Linden Ashby, Melissa Ponzio, and Tyler Hoechlin.\nTyler Posey as Scott McCall\nCrystal Reed as Allison Argent\nHolland Roden as Lydia Martin\nShelley Hennig as Malia Tate\nJR Bourne as Chris Argent\nIan Bohen as Peter Hale\nColton Haynes as Jackson Whittemore\nLinden Ashby as Noah Stilinski\nMelissa Ponzio as Melissa McCall\nRyan Kelley as Jordan Parrish\nSeth Gilliam as Alan Deaton\nOrny Adams as Bobby Finstock\nDylan Sprayberry as Liam Dunbar\nKhylin Rhambo as Mason Hewitt\nAaron Hendry as The Nogitsune\nVince Mattis as Eli Hale\nAmy Workman as Hikari Zhang[c]\nTyler Hoechlin as Derek Hale\nAdam Fristoe as Adrian Harris\nEaddy Mays as Victoria Argent\nManuel Rafael Lozano as Lieutenant Ibarra\nJesse Posey as Raymond Delgado\nNobi Nakanishi as Deputy Ishida\nL.B.

The majority of the original cast members reprised their roles,[1][2] although cast members Dylan O'Brien, Arden Cho and Cody Christian declined to return.[3][4][5][6] Teen Wolf episode director Russell Mulcahy returned to direct the film.[7]\nPrincipal photography began on March 21, 2022,[8] and finished on May 17.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released on Paramount+ on January 26, 2023.[9][8]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 32% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The cast is back but nostalgia can't save Teen Wolf: The Movie, a lackluster revival that retracts its claws and tucks its tail between its legs.\"[10] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 7 critics. including \"mixed or average reviews\".[11]\nTeen Wolf: The Movie broke Paramount+ records as the most watched original film on the day of its debut.[12]\nAt the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards, Teen Wolf: The Movie was nominated for Best Kick-Ass Cast.[13]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ As depicted in \"Insatiable\"\n\n^ Harris was apparently sacrificed by Jennifer Blake in \"Unleashed\"; the means by which he survived are not explained.\n\n^ Despite not being listed as a main character on the film's official poster, Workman is credited in the opening credits before Tyler Hoechlin.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Otterson, Joe (September 24, 2021). \"Teen Wolf Revival Movie Set at Paramount Plus as Creator Jeff Davis Inks MTV Entertainment Studios Overall Deal (EXCLUSIVE)\".
