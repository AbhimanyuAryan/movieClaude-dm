The film stars Morgan Freeman and Ruby Rose.\nVanquish was released in the United States on April 16, 2021.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nRetired disabled cop Damon (Morgan Freeman) forces Victoria (Ruby Rose), a former drug courier and his caretaker, to collect bags of money around the city during a single night by holding her daughter hostage. As the night progresses, Victoria finds out that at every stop point she makes, various enemies from her past attack her. Meanwhile, a cop breaks into Damon\u2019s home, but Damon kills him.\nAt her final stop, Victoria is captured and taken to the home of the corrupt Governor. The Governor asks for Victoria\u2019s help in taking down Damon, but Victoria refuses and kills the Governor instead.\nUpon finally returning to Damon\u2019s home, Victoria is reunited with her daughter. Then Damon explains that he had no need for the money that Victoria had collected; instead, this night was a part of his plan to eliminate all of Victoria\u2019s enemies along with the corrupt Governor, thus cleaning the city of crime and corruption.\nAs the dawn breaks, Damon lures all the corrupted cops that had been working for the Governor into his home, where he blows himself up along with them. Meanwhile, Victoria and her daughter escape safely.\n\nCast[edit]\nRuby Rose as Victoria\nMorgan Freeman as Damon\nNick Vallelonga as Det.
