Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe Bakers are a blended family that began with Paul Baker and his wife Kate who together had daughters Ella and Harley. They had friends who died in a car accident causing them to take in their godson Haresh. Kate eventually divorced Paul, but they remained friends with Kate acting as an occasional, though slightly inattentive, babysitter.\nZoey married football player Dominic \"Dom\" Clayton and had daughter Deja and son DJ. Due to Dom's celebrity life, Zoey divorced him and took custody of the kids. Paul met Zoey after she visited his small restaurant and suggested that he make the entire menu breakfast themed all day. The two eventually got married, expanded the restaurant, renamed it Baker's Breakfast and had two sets of twins: Luca and Luna, and Bronx and Bailey.\nDom continues to be active in Deja and DJ's lives which slightly intimidates Paul as he was rarely there to begin with. While Deja prepares for her basketball scholarship to the University of Southern California, DJ feels that he connects with Paul more than Dom and would rather speak with him. Paul gets a meeting with a large company to expand his restaurant. He succeeds and has his famous sauce sold on shelves. He decides to use the money to move the family and their dogs Bark Obama and Joe Bitin' from Los Angeles to Calabasas, in a bigger house in a gated community.\nUpon arrival, Zoey begins to feel the effects of racial profiling, especially after meeting her neighbor Anne. Paul suddenly gets a call informing him that his sister Rachel has checked into rehab, forcing him to take in his nephew Seth, who Ella and Harley claim is a criminal. Seth bonds with Haresh when he discovers that he is being picked on at the new school because of his ethnicity and teaches him to defend himself while making monster spray for his younger cousins. While not being used a lot on the Calabasa Hornets basketball team, Deja begins seeing a boy named Chris and sneaks out of the house to see him.\nPaul finds himself having to travel to look for new places to expand his restaurant. The investors Melanie and Michele also insist on altering some of his business ideals to cut costs. He starts to miss out on being with his family which upsets Zoey as this was the reason she divorced Dom. Haresh and Seth are suspended from school for a week after starting a fight with the kids who bullied Haresh causing Zoey to ground them. On DJ's birthday, Paul rushes to get home. During the party, things start to get out of hand as DJ changes his look to impress a girl. Anne profiles Zoey's family for a series of recent break-ins. Upon Paul arriving, Deja reveals that she quit the basketball team and that the entire family has been unhappy since arriving in Calabasas. Feeling that Zoey and Paul are no longer capable of handling their kids, Dom announces that he's filing for full custody of Deja and DJ.\nHarley and Ella accuse Seth of the break-ins after Haresh pointed out that he saw him stealing from the restaurant cash register, though he returned it and he angrily leaves. After telling Paul and Zoey they explain the money is from DCFS and they have been giving it to Seth and that someone broke into Anne house during the party while Seth was grounded. Upon realizing their mistake, the Bakers, Kate, and Dom all go out and find Seth. They apologize and admit that he is part of the family and he rejoins them.\nBack at home, Paul and Dom discuss their different upbringings. While Paul will never know what it is like to be at a disadvantage, Dom understands that being away from his kids has made him distant and that he needs to be more attentive. Realizing how much his family means to him, Paul breaks his deal with the company so that he can run the restaurant himself. The Bakers move back to Los Angeles and buy a new house while the children return to their old schools as Deja returns to her old basketball team. While having breakfast for dinner at the newly named Baker's Dozen Breakfast, Paul reveals the design of the sauce bottle has changed to reflect the entire family, including Seth.\nA postscript states that Dom, Paul, and Zoey were able to invest their sauce and went national, Kate invented bird yoga, Seth moved back in with his mom after she got out of rehab, but still spends lots of time with his cousins, Deja and Chris started their freshman year together, Ella became the social manager for Harley's punk band and became viral after a video of her playing at her school talent show broke the internet, Luna and Luca won the tennis national under 12 division becoming like Venus and Serena, DJ, Talia, and Dom went to Comic-Con and bonded while Dom realized he liked Thor.\n\nCast[edit]\nThe film stars Gabrielle Union, Zach Braff and Erika Christensen.\n\nGabrielle Union as Zoey Baker, the matriarch of the Baker family.\nZach Braff as Paul Baker, the patriarch of the Baker family and proprietor of the restaurant Baker's Breakfast.\nErika Christensen as Kate Baker, the ex-wife of Paul and owner of a yoga studio who still watches her kids on occasion.\nTimon Kyle Durrett as Dom Clayton, a football player who is the ex-husband of Zoey.\nJournee Brown as Deja Clayton, the daughter of Zoey and Dom who is a basketball player with dreams of being a starting point guard for USC.\nKyrie McAlpin as 8-Year-Old Deja Baker\nKylie Rogers as Ella Baker, the daughter of Paul and Kate who is a self-described future influencer.\nAndre Robinson as DJ Clayton, the son of Zoey and Dom who dreams of being the world's greatest Lego designer and comic book artist.\nElias Murphy as 3-Year-Old DJ Baker\nCaylee Blosenski as Harley Baker, the paraplegic daughter of Paul and Kate who is an expert musician in her punk band where she plans to have them go viral.\nAnnalyn Black as 4-Year-Old Harley Baker\nAryan Simhadri as Haresh Baker, the godson of Paul and Kate who they adopted after his parents died in a car accident caused by a drunk driver and dreams of being a player.

Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy briefly appear through archival audio from the 1950 film.\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn 2016, it was reported that Kenya Barris would work with 20th Century Fox on a remake of Cheaper by the Dozen.[5] On August 6, 2019, following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a reboot of Cheaper by the Dozen was in development and that it would premiere on the company's streaming service, Disney+.[6] Gail Lerner was set to direct the film with a script co-written by Kenya Barris and Jenifer Rice-Genzuk Henry. Lerner had worked for Barris as a writer on the television series Black-ish and appreciated that he saw her not only as a writer but also a director.[7] Principal photography was scheduled to commence on July 13, 2020, in Los Angeles, California.[8] After filming was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Disney's new CEO Bob Chapek announced that filming had resumed in November 2020.[9] The film was revealed at the Disney Investors Day, along with the casting of Gabrielle Union.[10][11]\nIn January 2021, Zach Braff joined the cast.[12][13][14][15][16] In February 2021, Journee Brown, Kylie Rogers, Andre Robinson, Caylee Blosenski, Aryan Simhaldri, Leo Abelo Perry, Mykal-Michelle Harris, Christian Cote, Sebastian Cote, and Luke Prael joined the cast as the pair's children.[17] Erika Christensen would be added to the cast in April.[18] Filming had begun in Los Angeles by April 2021.[19]\nShawn Levy, who previously directed the 2003 film adaptation, was confirmed in 2021 to be an executive producer on the film.[20]\nLerner thought it was important to adjust the film to accommodate the actors, and not have young performers speaking lines or expressions that did not come across as natural for them. Lerner said Zoey is the heart of the film, she praised Union for not falling into tropes or stereotypes, and not wanting to be pigeonholed as the stern mom and the finger-wagger. Union also served as an executive producer.[7]\n\nMusic[edit]\nJohn Paesano composed the musical score. The soundtrack was released on March 18, 2022, by Hollywood Records and Walt Disney Records.[21]\nAlso, Brandy and her daughter, Sy'Rai, recorded an original song \"Nothing Without You\" for the film. It was played during the end credits.\n\nRelease[edit]\nOn November 12, 2021, the film was revealed to be released in March 2022.[22] On February 7, 2022, with the release of the official trailer, it was revealed that it would be digitally released on March 18, 2022, on Disney+.[23] The film had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre on March 16.[24] Following its removal from Disney+, it was made available on other streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, Vudu and Google Play, on September 26, 2023.[25]\n\nReception[edit]\nAudience viewership[edit]\nAccording to Whip Media, Cheaper by the Dozen was the 5th-most-streamed movie across all platforms in the United States during the week of March 18, 2022, to March 20, 2022.[26]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 35% of 37 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Cheaper by the Dozen adds some modern twists to its oft-adapted story, but fresh laughs are few and far between.\"[27] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[28]\nVariety stated: \"Despite some of this movie\u2019s missteps, the heart behind its messages is in the right place. Sentiments dealing with co-parenting after divorce and prioritizing family above monetary success may seem old fashioned on the surface. Yet it goes deeper, exploring and challenging our societal system\u2019s gross inequities and injustices in a thoughtful, meaningful manner.\"[29] IGN rated the movie 6 out of 10, stating, \"Disney's latest reboot of Cheaper by the Dozen, starring Zach Braff and Gabrielle Union, can be as haphazard as its premise.\"[30] The Guardian rated the movie 3 out of 5 stars, stating, \"As with the 2003 film, the gist of Disney Plus\u2019s remake is cheerful domestic chaos molded into light didacticism: the importance of the nuclear family (albeit a blended one, in this update) with reminders to not get blinded by financial success or the lure of growth.\"[31] Screen Rant gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying \"Cheaper by the Dozen is a fluffy family drama that ultimately doesn\u2019t amount to anything. [...]  It is great that this blended family is so diverse, but if there is no thoughtful integration of their stories, they remain merely set dressing.\"[32]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nThe film received a nomination for Outstanding Makeup (Television or Film) at the 2023 NAACP Image Awards.[33][34]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures but the copyright is registered with 20th Century Studios, the latter who originally produced the film.[1]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"List of Disney Films\".
