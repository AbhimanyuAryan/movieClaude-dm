Produced by Nickelodeon Movies, it was directed by Dave Needham in his directorial debut,[1] from a screenplay by Kevin Sullivan and Chris Viscardi, and starring the voices of David Tennant, Michelle Gomez, Katy Townsend, and the regular voice cast of the series; consisting of Asher Bishop, Jill Talley, Brian Stepanek, Catherine Taber, Liliana Mumy, Nika Futterman, Cristina Pucelli, Jessica DiCicco, Grey Griffin, Lara Jill Miller, and Andre Robinson, who reprise their respective roles. The first film in the franchise, set between the fourth and fifth seasons of The Loud House, it tells the story of the Louds going to Scotland, where they learn that they are descended from royalty and own a castle, while contending with an evil plot.[2]\nThe film was originally going to be theatrically released in 2020 by Paramount Pictures. Instead, the film had a digital release on Netflix on August 20, 2021. It was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics, praising the songs, heartwarming messages, and loyalty to the series, but criticizing the animation, plot, and screenplay.[not verified in body]\nA live-action Christmas television film, A Loud House Christmas, was released to Nickelodeon and Paramount+ on November 26, 2021.[3][4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nLincoln Loud, the middle child and only son of Lynn Loud Sr. and Rita Loud, spends his time assisting his sisters\u2014Lori, Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, Lana, Lola and Lisa\u2014as they go about their day-to-day duties, while also teaching his youngest sister Lily how to cope with living in a large family. After a particularly successful day in which the sisters all win awards, they celebrate at Lynn Sr.'s restaurant. There, the Loud sisters are praised by fans while Lincoln is pushed to the side and ignored. Feeling that he is living in their shadows, he consults his friend Clyde McBride, who tells him about the time he learnt his grandmother's side of the family was from Paris.\nInspired, Lincoln asks his parents the same question and Lisa manages to trace Lynn Sr.'s heritage to Scotland. The Loud family then heads to Scotland for a week-long vacation on a hectic trip involving parachuting from a cargo hold, flying in a hot air balloon, and traveling in a submarine. Upon arriving in the Scottish town of Loch Loud, a town filled with many oddities, the Loud family learns from a boy named Scott\u2014who Leni falls in love with\u2014and Loch Loud's citizens that they are descendants of Scottish royalty. They are led to a castle ran by groundskeeper Angus and the disgruntled property caretaker Morag.\nAngus then shows the family members a painting of their ancestors that bears a striking resemblance to them and reveals they ruled the town for many years before sailing away forever. Lincoln eventually learns from Angus that his own ancestral counterpart, the Duke of the family, was the most special member of the family, much to his delight. Wanting to become the new Duke of Loch Loud, Lincoln partakes in many community service events to help restore the village to its former glory and eventually guilt-trips the rest of the family into moving to Scotland forever because they no longer have to share one bathroom. A bad service call from Lori causes Bobby to think they are breaking up.\nAs the Louds adjust to their discovery while experiencing the ghost of their descendant Lucille Loud, a baby dragon who grows very fast whenever she eats that they name Lela, and enjoying their time in the castle, Morag becomes frustrated with the family after living in the castle peacefully and quietly for many years. She then devises a plan like her ancestor Aggie to get the family to leave Loch Loud forever by hypnotizing Lela with a magic gemstone known as the Dragon Stone and the royal scepter.\nAfter the sisters begin to get attention in the village, Morag tricks Lincoln into riding Lela to try to get back his attention. While he rides the dragon, she uses the gemstone and scepter to hypnotize it into destroying the town so Lincoln would be blamed for the chaos. Feeling guilty for the damage, Lincoln asks the family to return home to Royal Woods. As the family leaves for home, Morag proceeds to make herself the new duchess of the town much to the displeasure of villagers. In retaliation, she hypnotizes Lela again to cause more destruction to the village.\nLucille tells the family of Morag's plan and what she's doing to the town. The Loud children head back to the town on a rowboat and team up to defeat Morag and un-hypnotize Lela. The sisters eventually get the scepter back and Lincoln, using his magic skills and with help from Lily, destroys the Dragon Stone, which breaks Lela out of her spell. In response, Lela drops Morag on an island filled with noisy seals. The citizens of Loch Loud congratulate the family and ask Lincoln to resume his place as the duke of the kingdom, though Lincoln declines and instead offers the crown to Angus instead, feeling he deserves it more. This decision is approved by the citizens and the other ghosts of the Loud ancestors. \nAfter helping repair the village, the Loud family says goodbye to Angus and the villagers and sets sail back home to Royal Woods. Bobby arrives to reunite with Lori only to find that she left. Clyde welcomes Lincoln back to Royal Woods with some duke-themed cream puffs.\nDuring the credits, still images are shown that include but are not limited to the Duke's ghost riding Lela, Bobby reuniting with Lori, Leni contacting Scott online, Lincoln winning a 3rd place trophy at a magic show, Lela having laid three eggs, and Angus and the ghosts rescuing Morag who now works as the groundskeeper with Lela keeping her in line.\n\nCast[edit]\nFurther information: List of characters in The Loud House franchise\n\nAsher Bishop[5] as:\nLincoln Loud\nThe Duke\nDavid Tennant as Angus\nMichelle Gomez[5] as Morag\nJill Talley[5] as:\nRita Loud\nRita Loud's 1600s ancestor\nBrian Stepanek[5] as:\nLynn Loud Sr.\nLynn Loud Sr.'s 1600s ancestor\nCatherine Taber[5] as Lori Loud\nLiliana Mumy[5] as:\nLeni Loud\nLeni Loud's 1600s ancestor\nNika Futterman[5] as Luna Loud\nCristina Pucelli[5] as Luan Loud\nJessica DiCicco[5] as:\nLynn Loud Jr.\nLucy Loud\nGrey Griffin[5] as:\nLola Loud\nLana Loud\nLily Loud\nScoots\nLara Jill Miller[5] as:\nLisa Loud\nLisa Loud's 1600s ancestor\nKaty Townsend[5] as:\nLucille Loud\nMrs. Scroggins\nOld Aggie\nAndre Robinson[5] as Clyde McBride\nCarlos PenaVega[5] as Bobby Santiago\nIzabella Alvarez[5] as Ronnie Anne Santiago\nBilly Boyd[6] as:\nScott\nFisherman\nJan Johns as:\nLela the Dragon\nLolo the Dragon\nCandi Milo as Submarine Captain\nCarlos Alazraqui as Bell Ringer\nDebra Wilson as:\nNana May\nNana Collette\nNana Helene\nMrs. Turnberry\nRuth Connell as:\nChip Shoppe Owner\nCab Driver\nTru Valentino as Fish Shoppe Owner\nPeter Ettinger as Uncle Jack's Nephew\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nOn March 28, 2017, Paramount Pictures' president Marc Evans announced a film based on the series originally set for a theatrical release on February 7, 2020.[7] However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.[8] On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on Netflix.[9][10][11]\nParamount president Marc Evans announced that, during Comic-Con, the studio will work closely with Viacom's TV brands, most notably Nickelodeon, which includes this movie.[7] When the film was first announced at Comic-Con 2017, series creator Chris Savino stated that the film would be non-canon to the show. Dave Needham later contradicted Savino's claim stating that it is canon since Lily is still in her diaper appearance. In a later interview on the Nerds Social Club Podcast, Needham states that this film takes place during the summer somewhere between \"Coupe Dreams\" and \"Schooled!\"[12]\nSavino had no involvement on the film after being fired from the show due to sexual harassment allegations back in October 2017.[13] In January 2021, it was announced that the film would be part of Netflix's 2021 film lineup.[14][15] The film's cast and crew were revealed in April 2021, confirming the entire main cast will be reprising their roles from the show, including new members such as David Tennant, Billy Boyd, and Michelle Gomez.[16]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe film's soundtrack was released on the same day the film was released, August 20.
