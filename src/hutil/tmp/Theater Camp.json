A feature-length adaptation of the 2020 short film of the same name, the film follows the counselors of an underfunded theater-focused summer camp in Upstate New York as they band together with the founder's son to keep the camp afloat. It features an ensemble cast that includes Galvin, Gordon, Platt, Jimmy Tatro, Patti Harrison, Nathan Lee Graham, Ayo Edebiri, Owen Thiele, Caroline Aaron and Amy Sedaris. Will Ferrell serves as a producer under his Gloria Sanchez Productions banner.\nTheater Camp had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 14, 2023, by Searchlight Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics and was named one of the top 10 independent films of 2023 by the National Board of Review.[6] Galvin received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Performance.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nJoan Rubinsky is the co-founder and director of AdirondACTS, a theater-focused summer camp in the Adirondacks in Upstate New York. While attending a show featuring one of her campers, a strobe light causes Joan to experience a seizure and slip into a coma. In her absence, Joan's son Troy, a professional \"business influencer\", inherits ownership of AdirondACTS but finds that his personality clashes with those of the theater kids. He makes various attempts to alleviate the camp's financial difficulties, including turning his cabin into an Airbnb, which he shares with guest Tim. He is assisted by Joan's staff, including Amos and Rebecca-Diane, two best friends who are also former campers and longtime staff members. \nAmos and Rebecca-Diane announce the summer's slate of productions, including Joan, Still, a new original musical based on Joan's life story, which they have yet to write. During auditions, Troy is approached by Caroline, a representative of investment firm Barnswell Capital, which operates the luxurious neighboring Camp Lakeside. Barnswell offers to purchase the property after revealing to the unaware Troy that the camp is facing foreclosure.\nAmos and Rebecca-Diane make progress on Joan, Still, with Rebecca-Diane promising to compose the lyrics and music for the show's finale. Meanwhile, Troy and the camp's chief technician, Glenn, attempt to raise money by having the kids act as servers during a Rotary Club event, with mixed results. As the production continues, Amos is troubled by Rebecca-Diane's continued absences, including disappearing from classes, missing her \"performance night\" for the campers, and failing to show up to rehearsals. Caroline winds up sleeping with Troy, who accidentally signs a contract to sell the camp. \nWith days remaining before the show, Amos presses Rebecca-Diane to unveil the closing number, which she has not completed. She instead performs an improvised number, sparking an argument between her and Amos. She reveals that she has been absent because she has been hired as a cruise ship performer; the revelation infuriates Amos, who resents feeling left behind in their partnership and refuses to listen to Rebecca-Diane's concerns that her career prospects are fading away. In the midst of their fight, Caroline arrives at the rehearsal, forcing Troy to reveal that the camp could be shut down.\nRealizing that the sale will only take place if the bank forecloses on AdirondACTS, Troy invites the \"Founding Ballers\", a group of popular financial influencers, to the performance of Joan, Still, hoping to get much-needed investments. The play is thrown into jeopardy when Darla, the lead, suddenly departs for a prime movie role, but she is replaced by Glenn, who seizes the opportunity to finally show off his talent. At the end of the show, the cast performs a completed version of Rebecca-Diane's closing number and shares what they have learned from attending camp. Amos and Rebecca-Diane reconcile, with Amos deciding to remain at AdirondACTS and giving Rebecca-Diane his blessing to leave, though she tells him that she\u2019ll come and visit him as much as possible.\nAlthough the Founding Ballers enjoy the show, they are revealed to be financially insolvent; instead, AdirondACTS is rescued from foreclosure by a significant donation from Tim, who related to the show's themes. Rebecca-Diane finds success with her cruise ship gig until she accidentally burns down the vessel trying to conduct a s\u00e9ance, while Glenn departs the camp to play Elphaba in Wicked at a Saratoga Springs theater. Amos dedicates himself to teaching, and Troy takes on his mother's work raising money for the camp. When the show finishes, a random hospital patient who was watching the show from a live stream praises the show, as Troy was planning to show it to his mother on the live stream but accidentally set it up in the wrong room. Joan awakens from her coma after the show finishes, with her first words being: \"Don't let Troy run the camp!\".\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBen Platt as Amos Klobuchar\nMolly Gordon as Rebecca-Diane\nNoah Galvin as Glenn Winthrop\nJimmy Tatro as Troy Rubinsky\nCaroline Aaron as Rita Cohen\nAyo Edebiri as Janet Walch\nNathan Lee Graham as Clive DeWitt\nOwen Thiele as Gigi Charbonier\nAmy Sedaris as Joan Rubinsky\nPatti Harrison as Caroline Krauss\nBailee Bonick as Mackenzie Thomas\nKyndra Sanchez as Darla Sanchez\nDonovan Colan as Devon Miller\nVivienne Sachs as Lainy Fischer\nAlan Kim as Alan Park\nAlexander Bello as Sebastian Campbell\nLuke Islam as Christopher L\nJack Sobolewski as Christopher S\nQuinn Titcomb as Alice Taylor\nMadisen Lora as Franny King\nSusie Essman as Woman in Hospital Bed (uncredited)[7]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment and casting[edit]\nMolly Gordon and Nick Lieberman (top row) co-directed the film and also co-wrote the screenplay with actor Ben Platt (bottom left) and co-produced it with Will Ferrell (bottom right).\nIn June 2022, it was reported that Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman would direct the film from a screenplay they wrote alongside Ben Platt and Noah Galvin.

The website's consensus reads: \"Theater Camp's authentic depiction of the theater experience may not resonate as strongly with non-actors, but they'll probably be laughing too hard to seriously complain.\"[20] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[21] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[19]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nThe film's ensemble was presented with the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.[22] The film was named one of the top 10 independent films of 2023 by the National Board of Review.[6]\n\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of Ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAstra Film Awards\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\nBest Comedy Feature\n\nTheater Camp\n\nNominated\n\n[23]\n\n\nBest Song\n\n\"Camp Isn't Home\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards\n\nFebruary 25, 2024\n\nBest First Screenplay\n\nNoah Galvin, Molly Gordon, Nick Lieberman, and Ben Platt\n\nNominated\n\n[24]\n\n\nBest Supporting Performance\n\nNoah Galvin\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Editing\n\nJon Philpot\n\nNominated\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Theater Camp\".
