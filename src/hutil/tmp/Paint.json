The film stars Owen Wilson, Michaela Watkins, Ciara Ren\u00e9e, Stephen Root, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Lucy Freyer, Lusia Strus, and Michael Pemberton. \nPaint was released in the United States on April 7, 2023, by IFC Films. \n\n\nPlot[edit]\nCarl Nargle has hosted Vermont's number one painting show for nearly three decades. His status as a superstar of public broadcasting is challenged when the struggling TV station hires Ambrosia, a younger painter who has more skill and versatility than Carl. \nHis timeslot is quickly taken over by her and so is his ability to seduce his co-workers. The station manager decides to fire Carl after an embarrassing fundraiser and gets him a job teaching painting classes at a nearby college, but he is too depressed to teach. The true love of his life, Katherine, comes to his aid when realizing that she has wasted her life waiting for his approval and Carl decides that he has been a foolish and vain playboy. The two confess their love to one another as Carl's barn accidentally burns down, leaving the town to believe that he is dead, when in reality, he is living a simple life with Katherine.\n\nCast[edit]\nOwen Wilson as Carl Nargle, a fictional character based on Bob Ross[2]\nMichaela Watkins as Katherine\nWendi McLendon-Covey as Wendy\nCiara Ren\u00e9e as Ambrosia\nLucy Freyer as Jenna\nLusia Strus as Beverly\nStephen Root as Tony\nMichael Pemberton as Dr. Bradford Lenihan\nDenny Dillon as PBS host[2]\nEvander Duck Jr. as Reuban[2]\nRyan Czerwonko as young bar regular[2]\nProduction[edit]\nThe film took 13 years to make.[3] In 2010, the screenplay Paint, written by Brit McAdams, was featured on the Black List of that year's most-liked unproduced screenplays.[4] On April 16, 2021, it was announced that Owen Wilson, Michaela Watkins, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ciara Ren\u00e9e, Lusia Strus, and Stephen Root had signed on to star in the film, which McAdams would also direct.[5] In May 2021, it was announced that Lucy Freyer would also star.[6]\nPrincipal photography took place from April 2021 to June 2021 in Albany, New York.[7][8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nPaint was originally set to be released by IFC Films on April 28, 2023, but was moved to April 7, 2023.

The website's consensus reads: \"Thanks to a creative canvas that's stretched too thin and haphazardly splashed with far too few colors, most viewers will find watching Paint a painfully dry experience.\"[12] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 45 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[13] Audiences surveyed by PostTrak gave it an 83% positive score, with 33% saying they would definitely recommend it.[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Paint (2023)\".
