Besides Perry, the film stars Cassi Davis-Patton, David Mann, Tamela Mann, Gabrielle Dennis, and Brendan O'Carroll. It is the twelfth film in the Madea cinematic universe. The film tells the story of Madea partaking in her great-grandson's college graduation party as hidden secrets emerge and surprise visitors show up. It was released on February 25, 2022. It is adapted from Perry's stage play Madea's Farewell Play, the first Madea film to be adapted from a stage play since A Madea Christmas. The film is also a crossover between the Madea franchise and the Irish sitcom Mrs. Brown's Boys.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, Mr. Brown puts too much gasoline on the barbecue and sets himself on fire. Other family members are getting ready for Tim's graduation celebration. Cora arrives with groceries and talks about how places in their neighborhood got burnt down in the riots. Laura arrives with divorce lawyer friend Sylvia.\nTim and Davi arrive with Tim's aunt Ellie in her police uniform. Joe tells her to get rid of it, saying police are criminals. She refuses, but later takes it off.\nAunt Bam starts hitting on Davi and Tim. Joe says he suspects the two boys are gay.\nAgnes Brown and her daughter Cathy arrive and after doing the \"Wakanda Forever\" salute, thinking her hosts were true Africans, Cora slams the door on them before letting them in. Madea starts threatening Agnes until Davi explains she is his great-aunt. Agnes asks \"Why do you all look like you have your knickers in a bunch?\" but everyone mishears \"knickers\" as \"niggers\". She lifts her skirt to explain that \"knickers\" are underwear.\nThey go to dinner at Red Lobster, where Cora gives Brown candy from Madea's purse for his blood sugar levels. Madea irritates Cora by reminiscing about her days as a stripper. Madea tries to show the restaurant is full of strippers by shouting a line from \"Up\", whereupon nearly all of the women reply. Joe arrives wearing Black Lives Matter memorabilia and resumes insulting Ellie over her police job. Back at the house Tim's father Richard has been waiting. Madea fires her gun without warning, making Joe defecate in his leather pants.\nWhile washing dishes Laura tells Agnes she is confused that Davi, after graduation, will return to Ireland to take over his grandfather's farm. Tim makes an announcement, coming out as gay. Everyone says they already knew. Sylvia reveals she has been secretly dating Richard. Madea orders Richard and Sylvia to leave at gunpoint.\nSeeing Mr. Brown and Agnes acting strangely, Cora tells Madea she gave them candy from her purse. Madea reveals that it was marijuana-laced chocolate. Mr. Brown, as \"The Brown Panther\", jumps off the roof in his underwear with a bed sheet cape and knocks himself out. Laura and Ellie are discussing Richard and Sylvia when Madea claims her roommate Rosa Parks stole her boyfriend in 1955, inadvertently setting off the Montgomery bus boycott and the Civil Rights movement as a whole.\nThe next morning, when Agnes apologizes Madea says she will give her the recipe for the chocolate marijuana. Tensions rise when Richard and Sylvia come back to the barbecue. Davi fights with Richard and Richard hits Laura by accident. Davi reveals he has been seeing Laura and proposes to her. She declines.\nLaura tells Ellie of her confusion that Davi is returning to Ireland. Ellie questions the reason Laura declined Davi's proposal. Tim rejects Davi's apology. Madea tells Laura to feel okay about the drama and apologize and convinces Tim to forgive Davi. At the graduation, Tim rips up his prepared speech and speaks about his family, apologizing to Davi and Laura, and crediting all his family for their love and support. When he gives credit to his father Richard, Madea interrupts to insult Richard.\nThe family congratulates Tim and Davi, Tim having told Davi he approves of his relationship with Laura. Davi proposes again to Laura who says yes. Agnes gives him her blessing, revealing that his grandfather need not know as he is in prison for sleeping with a sheep in a hotel. Agnes and Cathy prepare to return to Ireland. Madea says she cannot accept Agnes' invitation to visit because \"there is too much sand\", having confused Ireland with Iran the whole time.\n\nCast[edit]\nTyler Perry as:\nMabel \"Madea\" Simmons, a tough old lady, Perry also portrays Madea in the flashback sequence\nJoe Simmons, Madea's brother\nCassi Davis-Patton as Aunt Bam, Madea's cousin\nDavid Mann as Leroy Brown, a man who was thought to be Cora's biological father until Madea's Big Happy Family\nTamela Mann as Cora Simmons, Madea's daughter\nBrendan O'Carroll as Agnes Brown, Davi's great-aunt.
