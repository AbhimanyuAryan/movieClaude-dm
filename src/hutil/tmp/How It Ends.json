It stars Lister-Jones and Cailee Spaeny, with cameo appearances by 23 others in a series of vignettes, facilitating the reality of 2020 COVID-19 protocols while serving the underlying plot device of walking through the deserted streets of Los Angeles.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 29, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 20, 2021, by United Artists Releasing.\n\n\nPlot summary[edit]\nOn the last full day before a meteor arrives on its collision course with Earth, Liza takes stock of her life through a conversation with her \"metaphysical\" childhood self. The conversation carries through as they walk through the empty streets of Los Angeles to their cousin Mandy's End of the World Party. As they walk, they have short interactions with numerous individuals, including the metaphysical YS of others\u00a0\u2013 the Younger Selves who are now visible due to certain doom having elevated everyone's awareness. The Lizas also stop to visit some family, and friends, they want to see before the end.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nZoe Lister-Jones as Liza\nCailee Spaeny as Little Liza\nWhitney Cummings as Mandy (Liza's friend)\nTawny Newsome as Celine (Liza's friend)\nFinn Wolfhard as Ezra (the Lizas' cousin)\nNick Kroll as Gary (the drug buyer)\nLogan Marshall-Green as Nate (the ex Liza still loves)\nBobby Lee as Derek (Liza's neighbor)\nFred Armisen as Manny (YS version)\nGlenn Howerton as John (the car thief)\nBradley Whitford as Kenny (the Lizas' father)\nAyo Edebiri as Stand Up (the teacher)\nSharon Van Etten as Jet (the busker)\nOlivia Wilde as Alay (Liza's long avoided friend)\nPaul W.

In May 2021, American International Pictures acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film, and set it for a release in the United States on July 20, 2021.[7] However, subsequent worldwide waves extended the COVID-19 pandemic through 2021, and the film was released through video-on-demand and streaming services.\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on reviews from 74 critics, with an average rating of 6/10. The critics consensus reads: \"It can feel more like a collection of skits than a cohesive story, but How It Ends is a comedic vision of the apocalypse with fleeting moments of brilliance.\"[8]  On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"How It Ends\".
