Their revelations inspire believers but anger officials of both the Catholic Church and the secular government, who try to force them to recant their story. As word of their prophecy spreads, tens of thousands of religious pilgrims flock to the site to witness what became known as the Miracle of the Sun.\n\nCast[edit]\nJoaquim de Almeida as Father Ferreira\nGoran Vi\u0161nji\u0107 as Artur de Oliveira Santos[5][6]\nStephanie Gil as young L\u00facia dos Santos[7]\nAlejandra Howard as L\u00facia's cousin Jacinta Marto\nJorge Lamelas as L\u00facia's cousin Francisco Marto[7]\nL\u00facia Moniz as Maria Rosa\nMarco d'Almeida as Ant\u00f3nio\nJoana Ribeiro as the Virgin Mary\nS\u00f4nia Braga as Sister L\u00facia (L\u00facia dos Santos later in life)[7]\nHarvey Keitel as Professor Nichols[8]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nPontecorvo's first feature directorial credit was the drama Pa-ra-da.

Berney, co-heads of the film label Picturehouse, acquired the North American rights to the film in 2019. The Berneys made the deal with James T. Volk, chairman and founder of Origin Entertainment, which produced the film in collaboration with Elysia Productions and Rose Pictures. While at Newmarket Films, Bob Berney released and oversaw the marketing strategy for Mel Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ.[8]\n\nFilming[edit]\nIn May 2017 the production filmed the 100th Year Anniversary Mass in F\u00e1tima, celebrated by Pope Francis, and portions of the footage are used in the end credit sequence. Principal photography began in September 2018 and the film was entirely shot on location in Portugal.[8] Scenes were filmed in F\u00e1tima, Sesimbra, Cidadelhe (Pinhel), Tomar, Coimbra and Tapada de Mafra.[7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nFatima was released in 215 theaters and digitally through Premium Video on demand on August 28, 2020, by Picturehouse.[2][9] Originally scheduled to release on April 24,[8] it was later postponed until August 14, 2020, and again until August 28, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\nOn May 7, 2021, it opened in 380 AMC Theatres via their $5 Fan Faves deal.[11]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 53 reviews with an average rating of 6/10.

That its role models are children makes the message all the more remarkable.\"[15]\n\nSee also[edit]\n2020 in film\nThe Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima, 1952 film\nThe Song of Bernadette, 1943 film\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"F\u00e1tima, the Movie\".
