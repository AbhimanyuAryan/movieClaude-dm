Starring an ensemble cast consisting of Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Daniel Levy, Holland, Victor Garber, and Mary Steenburgen, the film follows a young woman who struggles to admit to her conservative parents that she is a lesbian while she and her girlfriend visit them during Christmas. A semi-autobiographical take on DuVall's experiences with her family, Happiest Season is the first lesbian Christmas rom-com produced by a major Hollywood studio.[2]\nProduced by TriStar Pictures, Happiest Season was released in the United States on November 25, 2020, by Hulu. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the cast. The film won a GLAAD Media Award in 2021 in the Outstanding Film \u2013 Wide Release category.[3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAbby Holland and Harper Caldwell are a couple who have been dating for nearly a year. Abby has disliked Christmas since her parents died, so Harper spontaneously invites her to celebrate the holidays with her family in her hometown. Abby sees this as the perfect opportunity to introduce herself to Harper's parents and propose to her on Christmas morning. However, on their way to the Caldwells', Harper reveals she lied about already coming out to her parents, fearing it would interfere with her father's mayoral campaign. She promises to come out to her family after Christmas, but asks Abby to pretend to be her heterosexual roommate for the holiday, to which Abby reluctantly agrees.\nAt the Caldwells', Abby meets Harper's father, Ted, her perfectionist mother, Tipper, and her artistic sister, Jane. She is welcomed by the family as Harper's \"orphan friend\" who has nowhere else to go for Christmas. Abby soon becomes uncomfortable, especially when she meets Harper's exes, Connor and Riley. She also begins questioning how much she knows about her girlfriend when she sees Ted and Tipper's high expectations and Harper's competitive relationship with her older sister, Sloane.\nTed is trying to impress a possible donor from the city council to contribute to his campaign, which Abby unwittingly jeopardizes when Sloane's children slip an unpaid-for necklace into her bag during an outing to the mall. Labeled a shoplifter, Ted and Tipper think it might be better if they keep Abby away from upcoming social events. As Abby starts to feel even more of an outsider, she learns from Riley that Harper has publicly denied her sexuality since high school, making her worried about their future.\nAt the Caldwells' annual Christmas Eve party, Abby, having tired of her situation, is relieved when her best friend John arrives to pick her up. Harper privately begs her to stay, and as they are about to kiss, they are caught by Sloane who prepares to expose their relationship to the family. However, it turns out, Sloane has her own secret: she and her husband, Eric, are getting a divorce. The sisters get into a public fight, ending with Sloane outing Harper as a lesbian, which Harper tries to deny. Heartbroken, Abby leaves the house, with John following her, and the two talk about their stories of coming out to their respective families: Abby's parents were loving and accepting, while John's father threw him out of their home and did not talk to him for thirteen years. John reminds Abby that coming out can be terrifying for gay people, but has nothing to do with Harper's love for her.\nRealizing her fear of rejection caused her to hurt Riley and may cause her to lose Abby, Harper confirms to her parents that she is a lesbian. This inspires Sloane to reveal her own secret, and even Jane tells her parents how neglected she felt over the years. While Tipper confronts Ted about the emotional pain their daughters have experienced due to their parenting choices, Harper goes after Abby to apologize, confessing that she truly loves her and wants to build a life with her. Touched, and with encouragement from John, Abby forgives her and they share a kiss.\nThe next morning, Ted apologizes to his daughters for making them feel they always had to meet his standard of perfection. He later receives a phone call from the campaign donor, who will support him only if Harper suppresses any details about her personal life. Ted rejects the offer. The Caldwells then take a family picture, with Abby included this time.\nOne year later, Abby and Harper are engaged, Jane has become a bestselling author with her fantasy novel, The Shadow Dreamers, and Ted has won the mayoral election. On Christmas Eve, the family goes to the cinema to watch It's a Wonderful Life. As the film starts, Abby and Harper smile at each other lovingly.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKristen Stewart as Abby, Harper's girlfriend\nMackenzie Davis as Harper, Abby's girlfriend\nAlison Brie as Sloane, Harper's eldest sister\nAubrey Plaza as Riley Johnson, Harper's ex-girlfriend\nDaniel Levy as John, Abby's best friend\nMary Holland as Jane, Harper's middle sister\nVictor Garber as Ted, Harper's father\nMary Steenburgen as Tipper, Harper's mother\nAna Gasteyer as Harry Levin, a potential campaign donor\nJake McDorman as Connor, Harper's ex-boyfriend\nBurl Moseley as Eric, Sloane's husband\nSarayu Blue as Carolyn McCoy\nJinkx Monsoon as Em K.

It's built. And the people seem real, or at least reality-adjacent.\"[25]\nSeveral reviews named Mary Holland (who played Jane) as the film's breakout star.[26][27][28][29]\nHappiest Season won the 2021 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film (Wide Release) and received Special Recognition for its soundtrack.[30][31]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn December 2020, DuVall said, \"I would love to do a sequel. I mean, I have a couple of ideas. We all had such a great time making the movie that we were talking about it then. But it was also just like, who knew if anybody would care about the movie or not? So I definitely am more than open to it.\"[32] In May 2021, Holland said that the sequel is in \"early stages\".[33]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Christmas films\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Happiest Season (2020)\".
