Tolkien. It is produced by Warner Bros. Animation and New Line Cinema with animation production by Sola Entertainment. A prequel set 261\u00a0years before the events depicted in The Lord of the Rings, and around 200 years before the events of The Hobbit, it stars Brian Cox as Helm Hammerhand, a legendary King of Rohan. Also starring is Miranda Otto, reprising her role as \u00c9owyn from the live-action The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.\nDevelopment of the film was being fast-tracked by June 2021, when it was officially announced at  20th anniversary celebrations of The Fellowship of the Ring, along with the involvement of Kamiyama, consultant Philippa Boyens (who co-wrote The Lord of the Rings film trilogy), and initial writers Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews. Animation work had begun by then, taking visual inspiration from the live-action films. Gittins and Papageorgiou were working on the script by February 2022.\nThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on December 13, 2024, by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nSet 261 years before the events of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,[1] The War of the Rohirrim tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary King of Rohan who must defend against an army of Dunlendings. He becomes the namesake for the stronghold of Helm's Deep.[2]\n\nCast[edit]\nBrian Cox as Helm Hammerhand: the King of Rohan.[2]\nMiranda Otto as \u00c9owyn: a future shieldmaiden of Rohan who narrates the film. Otto reprises her role from Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film series (2001\u20132003).[2]\nGaia Wise as Hera: the daughter of Helm who helps defend their people.[2]\nLuke Pasqualino as Wulf: the ruthless leader of the Dunlendings who seeks revenge against Rohan for the death of his father.[2]\nLaurence Ubong Williams as Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f Hildeson: Helm's nephew and successor to the throne of Rohan.[3]\nShaun Dooley as Freca: Wulf's father, a Dunlending lord.[3]\nLorraine Ashbourne, Yazdan Qafouri, Benjamin Wainwright, Michael Wildman, Jude Akuwudike, Bilal Hasna, and Janine Duvitski have been cast in undisclosed roles.[2]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nDuring 20th anniversary celebrations for the release of the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001),[4] film studio New Line Cinema announced in June 2021 that it was fast-tracking development of an anime prequel film with Warner Bros. Animation.[5] Titled The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, the film is set 183 years before the events of The Two Towers and tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, who is explored in the appendices of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novel and is the namesake for the fortress Helm's Deep seen in The Two Towers. Kenji Kamiyama and Joseph Chou were set to direct and produce the film, respectively, after doing the same for Warner Bros.' anime television series Blade Runner: Black Lotus, with Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews writing the screenplay.[4] The film was intended to be connected to the narrative of the film trilogy, with the trilogy's co-writer, Philippa Boyens, consulting on the prequel.[5] The trilogy's director, Peter Jackson, and other co-writer, Fran Walsh, were not involved with the project.[4]\nBy February 2022, the script was being written by Phoebe Gittins, Boyens' daughter, and her writing partner Arty Papageorgiou, based on a story by Addiss and Matthews.[6] Richard Taylor, the creative director of special effects company W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop, and illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe also joined the film's creative team after all working on the live-action trilogy.[7][2]\n\nCasting[edit]\nVoice casting for the film had begun by the time of its announcement in June 2021,[5] and announcements were expected soon after February 2022.[7] In June, Brian Cox was revealed to be voicing Helm, with Miranda Otto reprising her role of \u00c9owyn from the live-action films to serve as the narrator. Also revealed to be cast in the film were Gaia Wise, Luke Pasqualino, Lorraine Ashbourne, Yazdan Qafouri, Benjamin Wainwright, Laurence Ubong Williams, Shaun Dooley, Michael Wildman, Jude Akuwudike, Bilal Hasna, and Janine Duvitski.[2]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nSola Entertainment had begun work on the animation for the film by the time of its announcement in June 2021, and it will be its first production using hand-drawn animation in a style reminiscent of traditional anime productions. The film draws its visual inspiration from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.[5][7]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nA first look at concept art from the film, showing the influence of the live-action trilogy on its visuals, was revealed in February 2022.[7] In April 2023, Warner Bros. announced that a behind-the-scenes preview for the film would be shown at the Annecy Film Festival in June.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim will be released on December 13, 2024, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was previously scheduled for April 12, 2024, but was delayed to its current date due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[6][9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Tolkien, J. R.
