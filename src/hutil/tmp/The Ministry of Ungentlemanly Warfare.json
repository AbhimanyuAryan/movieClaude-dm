The film portrays a heavily fictionalized version of Operation Postmaster.\nThe film had its premiere on April 13, 2024 in New York and was released in the United States on April 19, 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis article needs an improved plot summary. Please help improve the plot summary. (March 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn late 1941, at the height of  the second World War, the United Kingdom is struggling to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly suffering bombing runs at the hands of the Luftwaffe. With the United States yet to officially join the war and their supply and aid ships constantly scuttled by German U-Boats, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-Boat resupply operation at the Spanish controlled island Fernando Po. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Frederich Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists renegade commando Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two trolleys attached to it.\nUtilizing the Danish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Henry Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen, begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, had been captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. Meanwhile, arriving early on the island, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered.\nOn the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. Despite Luhr eventually catching on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside  Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. While waiting to be court martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazi's naval strength, but have allowed America, who had recently joined the war following a Japanese sneak attack on an American naval base in Hawaii, to join the European Theatre.\nA montage of details reveal the post operation activities of several figures before the credits: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her movie career; Appleyard would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to be part of raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels.[4]\n\nCast[edit]\nHenry Cavill as Gus March-Phillipps\nEiza Gonz\u00e1lez as Marjorie Stewart\nAlan Ritchson as Anders Lassen\nHenry Golding as Freddy Alvarez\nAlex Pettyfer as Geoffrey Appleyard\nHero Fiennes Tiffin as Henry Hayes\nBabs Olusanmokun as Mr. Heron\nCary Elwes as Brigadier Gubbins 'M'\nTil Schweiger as Heinrich Luhr\nHenrique Zaga as Captain Binea\nRory Kinnear as Winston Churchill\nDanny Sapani as Kambili Kalu\nFreddie Fox as Ian Fleming\nOlaf Kayhan as Train Nazi\nMert Dincer as Compound Nazi\nEthel von Brixham\nKoray Tarman as Train Nazi\nProduction[edit]\nParamount Pictures acquired the rights to Damien Lewis's book The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare: How Churchill's Secret Warriors Set Europe Ablaze and Gave Birth to Modern Black Ops in 2015.

The website's consensus reads: \"Cranking up a true story of derring-do into a high-octane action flick that's heavy on spectacle if not suspense, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is another solid entry into Guy Ritchie's pantheon.\"[12] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Black Bear: The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\".
