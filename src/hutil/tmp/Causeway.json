It follows a soldier struggling to adjust to her life after returning home to New Orleans.\nCauseway had its premiere at the 47th Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2022.[1] The film was released in select theaters on October 28, by A24, then had a streaming release on November 4, 2022, on Apple TV+. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Lawrence and Henry. Among other accolades, Henry was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 95th Academy Awards.[3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nLynsey, a U.S. soldier, experiences a traumatic brain injury after an IED explosion during her tour in Afghanistan which forces her to return home in New Orleans.[4] She struggles to return to her daily life with her mother as she waits for her wish to return for redeployment. Her doctor is reluctant to sign her waiver to return as he feels that trauma is a strong link to her depression.  As she improves with rehabilitation, she becomes unlikely friends with James, an auto mechanic, and reveals to him that she is a lesbian.[5] James has physical and mental trauma after a car crash in which his nephew was killed on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.\n\nCast[edit]\nLawrence at the film's premiere in Toronto\nJennifer Lawrence as Lynsey\nBrian Tyree Henry as James Aucoin\nLinda Emond as Gloria, Lynsey's mother\nJayne Houdyshell as Sharon, a caretaker\nStephen McKinley Henderson as Dr. Lucas\nRussell Harvard as Justin, Lynsey's brother\nSean Carvajal as Santiago, a mechanic\nFred Weller as Rick, the pool cleaner boss\nNeal Huff as Neuropsychologist\nProduction[edit]\nIn April 2019, it was announced Jennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry had joined the cast of an untitled drama film, with Lila Neugebauer directing from a screenplay by Elizabeth Sanders. Lawrence, Justine Polsky, Eli Bush and Scott Rudin initially served as producers under their Excellent Cadaver and IAC Films banners, respectively, and A24 distributed it.[6][7]\nProduction began in the summer of 2019 in New Orleans, but was delayed due to Hurricane Barry. Production restarted in March 2020, but was once again delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was completed in the summer of 2021.[8] Lawrence and Henry continued to workshop the script together during the pandemic as a result of their chemistry and to further enrich it as their scenes were seen as the most compelling of the film.[2]\nIn April 2021, following allegations of abuse, Scott Rudin stepped back as a producer from the project.[9] On December 30, 2021, the WGA awarded final screenplay credit for the film to both Sanders and the team of Ottessa Moshfegh and Luke Goebel.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn July 2022, it was announced Apple TV+ would distribute the film.[11][12] The film had its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2022.[13] The European premiere was held on October 8, 2022, at the BFI London Film Festival.[14] It had a limited theatrical release on October 28, 2022,[15] and was released on Apple TV+ on November 4, 2022.[16]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nJennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry's (left and right, respectively) performances were acclaimed by critics. It was seen as a return to form for Lawrence and one of her best performances. Henry was labeled as the scene stealer and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 168 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Causeway takes a powerfully subdued look at the lingering effects of trauma, led by gripping performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry.\"[17] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[18]\nWendy Ide of The Observer awarded 4 stars out of 5, praised the film and wrote \" this is a subdued, sensitive drama and Lawrence is phenomenal, giving the kind of wary, reined-in performance that made such a compelling impression in her breakthrough film, Winter\u2019s Bone.\"[19] In a B+ review for Consequence, Mary Siroky wrote: \"while one of the few downsides of Causeway is the lingering desire to spend more time with these characters, the film holds an excellent return to form for Jennifer Lawrence and makes a stellar case for many more leading man roles for Brian Tyree Henry,\" further praising Lawrence's performance as \"gripping\" in comparison to her work in Winter's Bone and that Henry \"is so grounded here that there are moments we feel like we are intruding into his life.\"[20] Anna Smith for Time Out gave it 4 out of 5 stars review and wrote: \"both actors are terrific: Lawrence is understated and compelling while Henry is by turns sympathetic, amusing and heartbreaking...Causeway will offer plenty for fans of thoughtful, quality dramas that touch on humanity, trauma, connection and the kindness of strangers.\"[21]\nIn a review for The Austin Chronicle, Jenny Nulf wrote: \"Watching Jennifer Lawrence in a film that allows her to showcase her skills at full force after so many years without her is a welcome reminder that she\u2019s one of our greatest living actresses [...] Lawrence and Henry do an incredible job at dancing around each other, soft smiles to communicate their pain and hardships without relying on overwritten exposition. Director Lila Neugebauer (best known in the theatre space, but who also worked on the critically acclaimed series Maid) manages to keep the tone understated, focusing on the nuances of Lawrence and Henry\u2019s performances that carry the weight of the heavy script.\"[22] Adam White, giving the film 4 out of 5 stars in a review for The Independent, praised Lawrence's performance as \"brilliant\" (stating it as a reminder of previous acclaimed naturalistic work) and that \"Henry lends each hushed gap in James\u2019s tale the feel of a sledgehammer.\"[23]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\nAccolades received by Causeway\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nMarch 12, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBrian Tyree Henry\n\nNominated\n\n[24]\n\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\n[25]\n\n\nAustin Film Critics Association\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor\n\nWon\n\n[27]\n\n\nChicago Film Critics Association\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\n[28]\n\n\nCritics' Choice Movie Awards\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\n\nDallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association\n\nDecember 19, 2022\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\n4th Place\n\n[30]\n\n\nGeorgia Film Critics Association\n\nJanuary 13, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\n[31]\n\n\nGotham Independent Film Awards\n\nNovember 28, 2022\n\nOutstanding Supporting Performance\n\nNominated\n\n[32]\n\n\nFlorida Film Critics Circle\n\nDecember 22, 2022\n\nBest First Film\n\nLila Neugebauer\n\nNominated\n\n[33]\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nBest First Feature\n\nNominated\n\n[34]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBrian Tyree Henry\n\nNominated\n\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards\n\nMarch 4, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Performance\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nLas Vegas Film Critics Society\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nBest Actress\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nNominated\n\n[36]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBrian Tyree Henry\n\nNominated\n\n\nLondon Film Critics' Circle\n\nFebruary 5, 2023\n\nSupporting Actor of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association\n\nDecember 11, 2022\n\nBest Supporting Performance\n\nRunner-up\n\n[38]\n\n\nNational Society of Film Critics\n\nJanuary 7, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nRunner-up\n\n[39]\n\n\nOnline Film Critics Society\n\nJanuary 23, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominated\n\n[40]\n\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society\n\nJanuary 6, 2023\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nRunner-up\n\n[41]\n\n\nSeattle Film Critics Society\n\nJanuary 17, 2023\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nNominated\n\n[42]\n\n\nRome Film Festival\n\nOctober 22, 2022\n\nBest First Feature Award\n\nLila Neugebauer\n\nWon\n\n[43]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Causeway\".
