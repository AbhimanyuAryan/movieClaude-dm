The website's consensus reads: \"Prisoner's Daughter has an outstanding cast, but they're overwhelmed by a blandly busy story that offers few surprises.\"[5] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[6]\nLovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review, praising its cast and direction while criticizing its uneven screenplay, pivot from the drama to the action genre in the second act, and for not adequately fleshing out its characters.[7] Wendy Ide of Screen Daily wrote that \"There are very few surprises in this formulaic domestic drama, but there are pleasures to be had in watching.\"[8]\nRobert Daniels, in a review for RogerEbert.com, gave the film a mostly negative review, writing that it \"disappointingly undermines its own themes and characters at every turn.\"[9]\nMarya E. Gates of The Playlist was critical of the film, stating that the performances of Cox and Beckinsale were some of the film's only highlights.[10]\n\nSee also[edit]\nEels So Good: Essential Eels, Vol. 2 (2007\u20132020), an album with a song from this soundtrack\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Harvey, Dennis (June 27, 2023). \"Prisoner's Daughter: Catherine Hardwicke's Latest Gets Out of Jail and Into Melodrama\".
