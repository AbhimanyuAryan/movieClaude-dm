It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Samara Weaving, Ned Dennehy, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, Grant Bowler, Edwin Wright, Rhys Darby, Milo Cawthorne, Richard Knowles, and Mark Rowley.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in New Zealand on 5 March 2020 by Madman Entertainment. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing theatres worldwide, the film became available digitally on-demand less than three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn an alternative near future, an underground fight club and a criminal organisation known as Skizm has achieved massive popularity by live-streaming real death matches between criminals. Ordinary computer programmer Miles Lee Harris logs into Skizm\u2019s forum to insult viewers who turn murder into entertainment. Riktor, the criminal kingpin who runs Skizm, breaks into Miles\u2019 apartment with his henchmen Dane, Effie and Fuckface. After being beaten and drugged, Miles wakes up to find guns bloodily bolted into both of his hands. Miles learns that he has been forced to participate in Skizm by being pitted against Nix, the game\u2019s deadliest killer. Nix wants out of the games, but Riktor requires she kill Miles first.\nNix tracks Miles\u2019 phone. He tries to reason with Nix, but fails. Miles distracts her and she shoots up his apartment as he falls down the fire escape. After unsuccessfully attempting to recruit help from the police, Miles makes it to the park to meet his artist ex-girlfriend Nova Alexander, who tells Miles that she doesn\u2019t want to get back together. When Miles reveals what is happening to him, Nova flees in fright. Nova reports the situation to Detective Degraves. Degraves has his partner Stanton hack Nova\u2019s phone so they can track Miles. Miles gets temporary help from a vagrant named Glenjamin. Miles then goes to the office where he works so his friend Hadley can hack the Skizm tracking malware on his phone.\nMiles finally gets assertive by angrily pulling his guns after his continually condescending boss Zander insults him. Zander is shot in the head by Nix, who starts shooting up the office. Miles escapes in a stolen car and Nix chases him on a motorbike. Following a face-off where he again fails to reason with Nix, Miles calls Nova but sees Riktor kidnapping her. Miles phones the police and leaves his phone in a junkyard to provide the location. He then inadvertently interrupts a drug deal between two rival gangs. Nix shows up and starts gunning down thugs while trying to get to Miles. Miles accidentally makes his first kill, a gang lord who hunted him down.\nThe police arrive and arrest Miles. While transporting him, Degraves and Stanton explain their plan to use Miles as bait to lure Nix, who they have been trying to capture for years. Degraves reveals that Nix is his daughter. Nix was driven criminally insane after Riktor took revenge on Degraves for taking down Riktor\u2019s gang by blowing up his family\u2019s van. Degraves had managed to save Nix, but his wife and son had died. Stanton shoots Degraves in the head, revealing that he is a mole working for Riktor.\nStanton plays a video message in which Riktor explains that Miles has thirty minutes to kill Nix or else he will kill Nova. Miles recovers his phone from Degraves\u2019 body. While coercing a gaming caf\u00e9 patron into hacking Nova\u2019s phone to retrieve her location, Miles learns the Skizm communities dubbed him \u2018Guns Akimbo\u2019 as he has become the most popular player ever. Miles arrives at Nova\u2019s supposed location to find Riktor waiting. Riktor taunts Miles by dumping Hadley\u2019s dead body before driving away.\nMiles manages to secretly meet with Nix and tells her that Riktor murdered her father and kidnapped his ex-girlfriend. In her rage and desire for revenge, Nix agrees to a plan where they successfully stage a scene for Skizm's broadcast camera drones. She seemingly guns down Miles, who is actually wearing a bulletproof vest that he removed from Degraves. Henchmen recover Miles' body and transport him to Riktor's Skizm hideout. Nix joins Miles as they take down Riktor's henchmen, including Dane and Effie. A badly injured Nix sacrifices herself by detonating a suicide vest that blows up Fuckface and the rest of Riktor's men so Miles can survive. Riktor executes Stanton while making his way to the rooftop with Nova.\nAt the rooftop, Riktor keeps shooting Miles, but the latter determinedly charges at Riktor and ultimately throws him off the roof to his death, not before Riktor tells Miles that Skizm has spread worldwide and is becoming a global franchise. After Riktor dies, Miles starts to collapse from massive blood loss while imagining a romantic reunion with Nova. However, Nova actually becomes frightened and goes into shock after seeing what Miles is turning into.\nSome time later, Miles is scarred from his injuries, and while sitting in his car, he opens a file. He discovers a comic book written by Nova and learns that she is promoting Miles as a popular hero by writing a comic book based on their story. With Skizm spreading worldwide under new leaderships, Miles commits himself to do everything in his power to destroy the entire criminal organisation.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDaniel Radcliffe as Miles Lee Harris\nSamara Weaving as Nix Degraves\nNed Dennehy as Riktor\nNatasha Liu Bordizzo as Nova Alexander\nGrant Bowler as Detective Degraves\nEdwin Wright as Stanton\nRhys Darby as Glenjamin\nMilo Cawthorne as Hadley\nRichard Knowles as Zander\nMark Rowley as Dane\nRacheal Ofori as Effie\nColin Moy as Clive\nHanako Footman as Ruby\nSet Sj\u00f6strand\u00a0[sv] as Fuckface\nJ.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Frenetic to a fault, Guns Akimbo may leave some viewers reaching for the killswitch \u2013 but for others, its videogame-style violence will have plenty of replay value.\"[19] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 9 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[20]\nJohn DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"The ingredients for an engagingly ridiculous action pic are here, but the pacing's all wrong.\"[21]\nDennis Harvey of Variety wrote: \"This undeniably slick, energetic contraption plays somewhere between grating and numbing.\"[22]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Saban Takes Daniel Radcliffe Action Thriller 'Guns Akimbo'\".
