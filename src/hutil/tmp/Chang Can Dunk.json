(March 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Xiao Ming \"Bernard\" Chang is a band geek sophomore in high school who expresses interest in basketball, with whom he shares a rivalry with star player Matt O'Neil, his former friend. One day, he meets his new bandmate Kristy and becomes smitten with her, only for Matt to start hitting on her. Chang continues to feel threatened by Matt, especially when his friends lock him in the basement at a house party. He escapes and confronts Matt over a prior basketball game and claims that he can dunk, but Matt puts him down and he's humiliated when he falls into a swimming pool.\nChang continues his quest to reinvent himself, especially since his mother Chen always judges his decisions. He finally confronts Matt at school and bets that he can make a dunk by homecoming. Should Chang win, Matt must shave his head and give him his prized Kobe Bryant jersey. Should Matt win, Chang must shave his head and give him his prized 1st edition Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card. Kristy knows full well what the bet is really about, but chooses to support Chang regardless. Chang's best friend Bo helps him train rigorously, but after a week, feels that he hasn't accomplished much. He goes online and discovers Deandre Cooke, a YouTuber who films himself dunking.\nChang meets Deandre and gets him to take him on as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Seeing as how they cannot pay him, Bo instead offers to improve the terrible production of his YouTube videos. He agrees. Chang improves significantly as Deandre films and uploads his exploits online and the two form a bond. At the same time, Chang and his mother start to feel distant. The day before the dunk, Chang feels that he's still off and sneaks into the school late at night. In the morning, everyone gathers to see Chang's dunk attempt and after large fanfare, succeeds, winning the bet and earning him school fame.\nDespite his online recognition, Chen remains ignorant of her son's success. He's invited by ESPN to New York to talk about his win and he brings his friends with him. When he's asked to make the dunk again, he misses, claiming wind interference. However, Chang is consumed by his fame and nearly ditches his friends. At school the next day, Matt accuses Chang of cheating by lowering the basket on the court. Chang accuses him of racism and they fight, resulting in both boys getting suspended. Chen finally learns what Chang has been up to and tells him that he doesn't need to prove himself to others, while Chang says he cannot talk to her because she's always unhappy and makes everyone else unhappy. Chang realizes that he cannot make a dunk and publicly apologizes for his cheating.\nChen confronts Deandre over the time he spent with Chang, but he tells her that he was a great kid whom he truly believes in. Realizing that her son has potential, Chen goes home and destroys her house's unfinished veranda from her separated husband. Chang helps her and repairs their relationship. Chang makes up with Bo and Kristy, the latter of whom he starts dating. He tries out for the school basketball team and makes up with Matt, with both of them becoming better people. \nSometime later, Chang is on the basketball team and his coach tells him to enter a game. While he briefly makes a mistake, he steals the ball from an opposing player and dribbles down the court, rising for a dunk before the film ends as the crowd cheers.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBloom Li as Chang\nBen Wang as Bo\nZoe Renee as Kristy\nMardy Ma as Chen\nDexter Darden as Deandre\nChase Liefeld as Matt\nDominic Pace as Mr. Bennevido\nNile Bullock as Owen\nEric Anthony Lopez as Syd\nChris Critelli as Mr. Ryan\nJenna Roach as Melissa\nJim E.
