Romeo Miller had also signed on to play a younger Clifton. Principal photography was set take place in the San Francisco Bay area and New York City that summer.[9] The Great Recession caused a delay production and by April 2009 filming was expected to start in Winnipeg.[10] Two Lagoons and Astra Blue Media were then attached to co-produce, along with additional cast members of Mira Sorvino, Kevin Pollak, James Caan and Smokey Robinson.[10]\nBy July 2014, some cast members had been replaced.[11] Wood Harris replaced Simmons as Nat Clifton, Nathan Lane would play Saperstein and James Caan as Ned Irish.[12] Brian Dennehy, Patrick Warburton and Ludacris were all attached to star in undisclosed roles. The production budget was reported to be $10 million and filming was expected to begin in New York in late 2014.[11]\nProduction was subsequently completed by October 2022, with Pollak as Saperstein, Dreyfuss as Maurice Podoloff, Cary Elwes as Irish, Jeremy Piven as Joe Lapchick. Gary Clark Jr and Bobby Portis make cameos.[5]  Guigui and Jeff Cardoni composed the film's score.[13]\n\nRelease[edit]\nSweetwater was released by Briarcliff Entertainment on April 14, 2023.[5] The soundtrack album was released by Candid Records on the film's opening day.[14]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nReleased alongside Renfield, Mafia Mamma, The Pope's Exorcist and Suzume, the film earned $125,000 in its first day and went to debut on $351,010 from 1,204 theatres, finishing 13th at the box office.[15]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 26% of 19 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.8/10.[16] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film a 62% positive score, with 46% saying that they would recommend it.[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Sweetwater\".
