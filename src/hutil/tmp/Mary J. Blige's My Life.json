Commemorating the 25th anniversary of her 1994 studio album My Life, the film was released on June 25, 2021, on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\nSummary[edit]\nMy Life revisits the early life and career of Mary J. Blige, with a focus on her 1994 studio album of the same name. The film features appearances by Andre Harrell, Blige's sisters, the My Life songwriters, Sean Combs,[2] Method Man, Alicia Keys, Tyler Perry, and Nas,[3] as well as footage of Blige performing the album live for the first time during its 25th anniversary in 2019.[4]\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn December 2019, Amazon Studios and Entertainment One announced a documentary film on Mary J. Blige.[5][6] The film was produced by Amazon Studios in collaboration with Blige's production company Blue Butterfly.[7] It was directed by Vanessa Roth, with Blige serving as executive producer.[8] The film also features music composed by Mervyn Warren.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nOn June 23, 2021, the film received its world premiere at the Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City.[10] It was made available digitally on-demand through streaming platform Amazon Prime Video on June 25, 2021.[11] A ballad by Mary J. Blige titled \"Hourglass\", co-written by Teddy Riley, Andy Murray, Benjamin Wright, and Romans, was released in conjunction with the film.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 60% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10.[13] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[14]\nJohnny Loftus of Decider stated that it \"celebrates the lasting influence of an incredible album\" while also highlighting \"the singer and songwriter\u2019s profound struggle for wellness\".[15] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Ordona praised the film for \"its fan testimonials of the album\u2019s impact and Blige\u2019s emotional recollections of the songs' roots.\"[16] Robert Daniels of RogerEbert.com described the film as \"fortuitously (providing) a love letter to Blige\u2019s fans that teems with the same truthful message as the singer's best music\".[17] In a review for Variety, Andrew Barker wrote that \"as a fan-centric retrospective, (the film) hits plenty of the right notes; but as a chance to more thoroughly explore a complicated, still-influential landmark, it never digs quite deeply enough.\"[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Mary J Blige's My Life (2021) - Financial Information\".
