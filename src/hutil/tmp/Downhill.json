The film is a remake of Force Majeure (2014) by Swedish director Ruben \u00d6stlund. It stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell as a married couple going through a rough patch after a near-death encounter during a family ski outing.\nDownhill had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2020, and was theatrically released on February 14, 2020, by Searchlight Pictures, the first feature film to be released under the studio's new name following The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of 21st Century Fox.[2] The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $9 million worldwide.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAfter believing they are about to be killed by an avalanche during a family ski vacation in Ischgl, Austria, a married couple is thrown into disarray as they are forced to reevaluate their lives and how they feel about each other.\n\nCast[edit]\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Billie Stanton[3]\nWill Ferrell as Pete Stanton\nMiranda Otto as Lady Bobo\nZo\u00eb Chao as Rosie\nZach Woods as Zach\nKristofer Hivju as Michel\nAlex Macqueen as Charlie\nJulian Grey as Finn Stanton\nAmmon Jacob Ford as Emerson Stanton\nGiulio Berruti as Guglielmo\nProduction[edit]\nIt was announced in November 2018 that an English-language remake of the Swedish film Force Majeure would be directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who both co-wrote the script with Jesse Armstrong. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell were cast to star.[4] Miranda Otto, Zo\u00eb Chao and Zach Woods also joined the cast, in December.[5] Kristofer Hivju appears in the film, the only original cast member from Force Majeure to be involved.\nFilming began in January 2019 in Austria.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nDownhill had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2020.[7] The film was released on February 14, 2020, replacing Fox's The King's Man, which had been scheduled for that date.[8]\n\nHome media[edit]\nDownhill was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital on May 19, 2020 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, Downhill was released alongside Sonic the Hedgehog, The Photograph and Fantasy Island, and was projected to gross around $4 million from 2,275 theaters in its four-day opening weekend.[9] It made $2.6 million on its first day and $5.2 million over the four days, finishing tenth.[10]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 37% based on 211 reviews, with an average of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fittingly named for a remake whose charms are dwarfed by its superior source material, Downhill is frequently -- and frustratingly -- less than the sum of its talented parts.\"[11] On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[12] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 1 out of 5 stars, with 26% of people saying they would definitely recommend it.[10]\nOn RogerEbert.com, Nick Allen gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying, \"It's yet another instance in which it's hard to not think about what could have been, especially since the original did it so much better.\"[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Downhill (2020)\".
