It is based on the life of his father, Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nThe film depicts the life and career of record producer and Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart, who was credited with discovering many iconic musical acts such as Donna Summer, Kiss, Village People, Cameo; and signing and pushing acts including the Pips (without Gladys Knight), Cher and Parliament to greater heights.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nJeremy Jordan as Neil Bogart\nWinslow Fegley as Young Neil Bogart\nMichelle Monaghan as Elizabeth \"Beth\" Weiss-Bogart\nJay Pharoah as Cecil Holmes\nDan Fogler as Buck Reingold\nJames Wolk as Larry Harris\nJason Isaacs as Al Bogatz\nLyndsy Fonseca as Joyce Biawitz\nPeyton List as Nancy Weiss-Reingold\nWiz Khalifa as George Clinton\nSebastian Maniscalco as Giorgio Moroder\nTayla Parx as Donna Summer\nLedisi as Gladys Knight\nJason Derulo as Ron Isley\nSam Harris as Paul Stanley\nCaylee Cowan as Farrah Lee\nChris Redd as Frankie Crocker\nPink Sweats as Bill Withers\nCasey Likes as Gene Simmons\nAlex Gaskarth as Peter Criss\nMatt Greiner as Peter Criss in performances\nMichael Ian Black as Bill Aucoin\nVincent Pastore as Big Joey\nProduction[edit]\nThe project was originally announced in September 2011, with Timothy Scott Bogart writing and directing the feature about his late father. Justin Timberlake was cast as Bogart.[1][2] In October 2013, Spike Lee was in talks to direct the film.[3] In January 2014, the film was delayed due to the Envision Entertainment scandal.[4]\nIn June 2019, Deadline reported that Timothy Bogart would direct the film, with Jeremy Jordan now cast as Bogart, and Samuel L. Jackson, Kenan Thompson, Jason Isaacs and Jason Derulo amongst the extensive cast.[5] Richard Dreyfuss and Sebastian Maniscalco were added to the cast in August.[6] In June 2021, new cast members were announced, including Wiz Khalifa replacing Jackson and newcomer Casey Likes playing Gene Simmons.[7]\nFilming began on July 16, 2019, in Montreal, with plans to wrap on September 20.[5][8] On August 23, Canadian actors' union ACTRA issued a \"Do Not Work\" order forbidding its members from working on the film, alleging the producers were \"unfair engagers for failure to meet payroll obligations.\"[8][9] As of June 17, 2021, filming had begun in New Jersey.[7]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released in theaters on March 31, 2023.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 30% of 47 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A fairly flat telling of a true story that was far more colorful and entertaining in real life, Spinning Gold is destined for the cutout bin.\"[11] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Justin Timberlake To Portray Neil Bogart In Feature Biopic Of Late Record Executive\".
