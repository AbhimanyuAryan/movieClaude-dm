It was released on July 30, 2021, by IFC Films.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nMatt DeHart and his family claim that after he discovered documents showing misconduct by the CIA, he was the victim of an attempted cover-up by the United States government. He alleges that he was tortured by the FBI and framed for the possession of child pornography. His claims remain unverified and ultimately he pleaded guilty to sex crimes against minors in federal court in Tennessee.\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2020.[2][3] The film was initially set to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020, but the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[4][5][6] In March 2021, IFC Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, and set it for a July 31, 2021, release.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nEnemies of the State holds a 78% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews, with an average of 6.4/10.
