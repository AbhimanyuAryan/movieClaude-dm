The film co-stars Bowen Yang, Conrad Ricamora, James Scully, and Margaret Cho. Inspired by Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the story follows a group of gay friends who go on vacation to Fire Island, only for things to become complicated by classism and romance.\nDistributed and produced by Searchlight Pictures, the film was released on Hulu on June 3, 2022. The film received generally positive reviews.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nEvery year, Noah and his close friends Howie, Luke, Keegan, and Max embark on a weeklong vacation to Fire Island, noted for its gay villages. The group takes the ferry from Sayville, New York on Long Island's South Shore to Fire Island Pines, and are reunited with their \"house mother\" Erin. Erin reveals that she has to sell her house, making this the last week they will spend together. The group meets Charlie, a doctor, and his wealthy friends, including Will, a lawyer, and Cooper. Howie and Charlie take interest in each other. Noah decides that his mission for the trip is for Howie to get laid. Charlie invites the group to his house, where the group gets drunk and causes a scene while Charlie and Howie get closer. Noah overhears Will criticizing the group's behavior.\nThe next day, Noah invites Charlie and his friends to dinner at Erin's. At the grocery store, Noah meets Dex and they flirt. After seeing that Will dislikes Dex, Noah invites Dex to dinner as well. Charlie, Cooper, and Will arrive for dinner, and Noah and Will discuss books, surprising Noah. Dex arrives, making Will uncomfortable. Dex claims that Will judges him for making content on OnlyFans.\nHowie tells the group that he and Charlie kissed, making Noah more intent on making the two a match. The group attends the weekly underwear party in Cherry Grove and do an assortment of illicit drugs. Cooper implies to Noah that he wants Will for himself and accuses Noah's growing attraction to Will of being based on money.\nNoah meets up with Dex again. They head to the dark room to have sex, but Noah is distracted by Will and accidentally hits Dex in the nose. This causes a public confrontation between Cooper, Will, Dex, and Noah, during which Noah sees Charlie making out with someone that is not Howie. Noah gathers his intoxicated friends and Howie, who is distraught about Charlie. Noah walks back to the Pines with Will and they fight. Noah accuses Will of being uptight and judgmental, and Will tells Noah that Noah is pretentious even if he pretends not to be. At an afterparty in the Pines, Howie and Noah fight. Howie wants to give up on searching for romance and tells Noah that their experiences are not the same just because they are both gay and Asian, citing issues of body dysmorphia.\nNoah is woken up the next day by his friends delivering a letter from Will. Will apologizes for the impression he gave and explains that Dex hurt someone close to Will in the past. Charlie arrives to tell Howie that he has gotten back together with his ex-boyfriend, who has Lyme disease, and will be leaving the island sooner than expected.\nNoah runs into Will at a drag bar. He shows Noah Dex's Instagram profile, on which he posts thirst traps with activism tags (\"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Stop Asian Hate\") to get attention. Noah and Will grow closer. Later, the group learn that Dex has posted a video of him and Luke having sex online without Luke's consent. Will helps Noah confront Dex by threatening legal action. Dex agrees to take down the video.\nThe next day, Howie tells Noah he is leaving because he cannot get over Charlie's rejection. Noah confronts Charlie, who acknowledges that he has feelings for Howie. Noah and his friends hijack a water taxi to catch up to Howie's. Charlie express his feelings to Howie, and they kiss. The group goes to watch the sunset. Noah and Will dance together and finally kiss, agreeing to give their relationship a try.\n\nCast[edit]\nJoel Kim Booster as Noah, based on Elizabeth Bennet\nBowen Yang as Howie, based on Jane Bennet and Charlotte Lucas\nConrad Ricamora as Will, based on Fitzwilliam Darcy\nJames Scully as Charlie, based on Charles Bingley\nMargaret Cho as Erin, based on Mr. Bennet\nMatt Rogers as Luke, based on Lydia Bennet\nTom\u00e1s Matos as Keegan, based on Kitty Bennet\nTorian Miller as Max, based on Mary Bennet\nNick Adams as Cooper, based on both Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine de Bourgh\nZane Phillips as Dex, based on George Wickham\nMichael Graceffa as Rhys, based on Anne de Bourgh\nAidan Wharton as Braden\nPeter Smith as Moses, based on Mr Collins\nBradley Gibson as Johnny\nProduction[edit]\nStreaming television network Quibi announced development of a comedy series titled Trip in September 2019, starring, created, and written by Joel Kim Booster.[2][3] The project was given a series order on March 11, 2020, with Jax Media set to produce.[2] Bowen Yang was cast in a lead role on April 15, 2020. Booster and Yang, who are both out gay Asian comedians and \"life-changing\" friends, were set to play fictionalized versions of themselves.[4][5] Closet Monster filmmaker Stephen Dunn was attached to direct the series.[4] Upon the shutdown of Quibi on December 1, 2020, the entire project was jeopardized.[6]\nSearchlight Pictures announced the purchase of Booster's script on June 30, 2021, to produce as a feature film re-titled Fire Island. Spa Night director Andrew Ahn replaced Dunn as director.[7] The following month, Margaret Cho joined the cast of the film, as the only woman to be part of the film's cast.[8] Conrad Ricamora, James Scully, Matt Rogers, Tomas Matos, Torian Miller, and Nick Adams were added to the film in August 2021, with Zane Phillips, Michael Graceffa, Aidan Wharton, Peter Smith, and Bradley Gibson joining the ensemble cast.[9] Principal photography began August 12, 2021, and was scheduled to last through September 2021, with filming taking place in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Fire Island, the locale of the film's title.[10] The final script incorporated humorous topics the filmmakers had long shared as friends.[11]\n\nThemes[edit]\nPride and Prejudice In a Queer Context[edit]\nIn Fire Island, Joel Kim Booster reimagines Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" through a queer lens, transporting the classic themes miscommunication and romance to the contemporary setting of Fire Island, New York. The adaptation introduces a group of gay men who frequent Fire Island, drawing parallels between Joel Kim Booster personal experiences and those depicted in Austen's novel.[12] Through the queer elements of the adaptation, themes of class and race emerge, offering insights into the dynamics of the LGBTQ+ community and its representation in media in the modern sense by destabilizing a classic love story.\nThrough its queer adaptation of a classic novel, Fire Island challenges conventional narratives of romance and relationships. Booster subverts traditional gender roles and heteronormative expectations, offering a fresh perspective on love, desire, and societal norms.[13] The film invites viewers to reconsider preconceived notions of romance and embrace diverse expressions of love and desire that are expressed through the movie and often overlooked in Austen's original writing.\"Fire Island\" serves as both a tribute to Jane Austen's themes and a celebration of queer identity and community.[14] Through its queer elements, the adaptation enriches the narrative, offering a reflection on love, friendship, and belonging in the LGBTQ+ experience.\n\nClass Relations[edit]\nIn the film, the characters navigate the intricacies of social class within the queer community, even in a space like Fire Island, where traditional heterosexual norms are absent. Joel Kim Booster, the screenwriter, draws parallels between Austen's exploration of class struggles and the dynamics observed within the queer community. He emphasizes how, in the absence of straight oppression, queer individuals can inadvertently recreate artificial class systems and hierarchies.[15] Booster highlights the magnification of these divisions in a space like Fire Island, where only gay people congregate. \nSimilar to Austen's novel, the forging of relationships across perceived class lines is also impacted by these biases, as Howie finds himself enamoured with Charlie, a charming doctor who is part of a group of affluent and judgmental individuals.[16] Among Charlie's friends is Will, the Mr. Darcy to Noah's Lizzie for adaptation. As these social circles intertwine, tensions escalate with the characters being made to feel unwelcome in Charlie's upper-class circle, with Noah and Will exchanging both flirtations and sharp remarks.[17]\nThe film portrays the ways in which queer individuals assess one another, drawing from their own experiences of discrimination and marginalization to perpetuate a hierarchical class system seen in a straight community as way to elevate their own social status within the community.[18] Through the lens of Austen's exploration of class distinctions, Fire Island depicts how these divisions can hinder genuine connections between individuals who may otherwise be perfectly suited for each other. \n\nRace Relations[edit]\nIn addition to class dynamics, Fire Island tackles issues of race within the queer community, particularly highlighting the experiences of Asian American characters. The film features a predominantly POC cast, reflecting the diverse realities of queer individuals. Characters like Bowen Yang's Howie represent the intersection of being queer and Asian-American, adding layers to the narrative and offering representation to underrepresented communities within the LGBTQ+ umbrella.[19] Despite the perception of the queer community as a bastion of inclusivity, the film acknowledges the existence of rigid boundaries influenced by race and ethnicity.\nThe characters confront these biases while navigating their experiences on Fire Island, a historically safe space for gay men, not being the most accepting to them due to their current financial trouble, diverse racial and gender identities as well as their non-conform body types.\nThrough its portrayal of race dynamics, \"Fire Island\" contributes to broader conversations about representation and inclusivity within mainstream media. By showcasing the experiences of Asian American characters acknowledging the abuse and fetishization they face within the community the movie confronting biases within the queer community. The film challenges stereotypes and underscores the importance of acceptance and solidarity among marginalized groups.\n\nFire Island as a Setting[edit]\n\"Fire Island\" serves as a poignant exploration of queer spaces, particularly focusing on the titular island as a haven for the LGBTQ+ community. The film celebrates Fire Island's significance as a historic queer hotspot, where individuals could socialize without fear of judgment or persecution.This portrayal captures the essence of the island as a sanctuary where queer individuals can freely live the queer experience. Throughout the narrative, there is a deliberate absence of straight characters, allowing queer culture to be glorified and celebrated authentically.[20] This specificity highlights Fire Island as a place where queer individuals can exist free from the influence of heteronormativity, exploring the nuances of LGBTQ+ life without the need to cater to cis-het audiences.[21]\nBy centering on found family and friendship dynamics within the community, \"Fire Island\" offers a nuanced portrayal of the joys and complexities of LGBTQ+ life. The movie also changes the expectations of the typical retelling of Pride and Prejudice by concentrating more on the friendship and family elements present in the original writing, moving it away from a more traditional rom-com. By focusing on the relationship between Lizzie (Noah) and Jane (Howie) as well as their attachment to the family house they are losing, it sets the priorities of the movie to the core of the queer experience.[22] The movie emphasizes the necessity of portraying how joyful and raunchy queer experiences while also acknowledging the potential for the community to experience internal conflicts and divisions.[23] The film plays on the dichotomy between the strength that comes from chosen families and the challenges that arise when internalized biases, such as those related to body image, wealth, and race, manifest within what is expected to be safe spaces.\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released June 3, 2022, on Hulu in the United States, Star+ in Latin America, and later released on June 17 Disney+ via Star in other international territories.[9][24]\n\nReception[edit]\nAudience viewership[edit]\nAccording to Whip Media's viewership tracking app TV Time, Fire Island was the eighth most anticipated film during the month of June 2022.[25] According to the streaming aggregator Reelgood, Fire Island was the sixth most streamed movie across all platforms during the week of June 11, 2022.[26]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 112 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Brought to life by a tremendously talented cast, the breezily entertaining Fire Island proves there are still fresh ways to update Austen.\"[27] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[28]\nAlex Abad-Santos of Vox applauded Fire Island  for being a high-profile comedy movie that dares to focus on gay men's sex lives without providing debauchery, and found the screenplay ambitious for its approach on social expectations, stereotypes, and racism. He also praised the film's take on friendship between LGBT people, while complimenting the chemistry between Joel Kim Booster and Bowen Yang's characters.[29] David Fear of Rolling Stone found Fire Island to be a love letter to the LGBT community and its culture, writing, \"This romantic comedy has its share of those archetypes. It also has gay lead characters, gay love interests, gay heroes, gay villains, and gay people of color galore. That doesn't excuse some of the clunkier, more brochure-friendly scenarios that Fire Island throws at them. But it does give you the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing everyone to this picture-perfect spot and inviting them to the party in the Pines, had been the means of uniting them.\"[30]\nSiddhant Adlakha of IGN rated the movie 9/10 and wrote: \"Indie director Andrew Ahn creates a mainstream queer classic with the romcom Fire Island, his inventive modern adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Following a group of gay friends on a wild vacation, it features some of the funniest and most tension-filled scenes in any movie this year. As complete as any piece of entertainment can be.\"[31] Jude Dry of IndieWire gave the film an \"A\u2212\" rating.[32] Dry found Booster's screenplay amusing and stated that Andrew Ahn's direction \"brings a cinematic touch that elevates the comedy.\"[32]\nOdie Henderson of RogerEbert.com rated the movie three out of four stars and called it an entertaining and heartfelt romantic comedy film.[33] Henderson complimented Booster's screenplay for its humor and its approach on racial issues, and praised Ahn's approach to plot lines and characters conflicts.[33] Henderson also singled out cinematographer Felipe Vara de Rey, saying he manages to provide a nostalgic feeling about the island of the same name.[33] Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media rated the film three out of five stars and complimented the movie for its depiction of positive messages and role models, as well as its diverse characters of different origins and sexualities. Green stated Fire Island manages to approach issues raised by heteronormativity and social expectations.[34]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nArtios Awards\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nOutstanding Achievement in Casting \u2013 Film, Non-Theatrical Release\n\nJessica Munks, Andrew Fem\n\nWon\n\n[35]\n\n\nDorian Awards\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nBest TV Movie or Miniseries\n\nFire Island\n\nWon\n\n[36]\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nOutstanding Film \u2013 Streaming or TV\n\nFire Island\n\nWon\n\n[37][38]\n\n\nGotham Awards\n\nNovember 28, 2022\n\nEnsemble Tribute\n\nNick Adams, Joel Kim Booster, Margaret Cho, Tom\u00e1s Matos, Torian Miller, Zane Phillips, Conrad Ricamora, Matt Rogers, James Scully, and Bowen Yang\n\nWon\n\n[39]\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association TV Awards\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nBest Streaming Movie\n\nFire Island\n\nNominated\n\n[40]\n\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards\n\nMarch 4, 2023\n\nBest First Screenplay\n\nJoel Kim Booster\n\nNominated\n\n[41]\n\n\nMill Valley Film Festival\n\nOctober 15, 2022\n\n10 Screenwriters to Watch\n\nJoel Kim Booster\n\nWon\n\n[42]\n\n\nPrimetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards\n\nJanuary 6-7, 2024\n\nOutstanding Television Movie\n\nFire Island\n\nNominated\n\n[43]\n\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nJoel Kim Booster\n\nNominated\n\n\nProducers Guild of America Awards\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nOutstanding Producer of Streamed or Televised Motion Pictures\n\nJohn Hodges and Brooke Posch\n\nNominated\n\n[44][45]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jung, E.
