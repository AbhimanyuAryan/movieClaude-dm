They manage to get away with the game but find themselves unable to play the game because they do not know the password to the television. Jodie and Hazel's mother (Hoetmer) agrees to tell the boys the password if they bring her a blueberry pie. Unable to secure a pie from the local pie-maker, they get her recipe and set out to find the ingredients. While trying to get eggs, the last carton is taken by John Redrye of the Enchanted Blade Gang.\nThey follow him to the home of the gang, led by Anna-Freya Hollyhock (Tipton), who may be a witch. They stowaway in the back of their truck and ultimately find themselves on an adventure where they team up with Anna-Freya's daughter, Petal, to find a speckled egg, make the blueberry pie, and play their video game.[4]\n\nCast[edit]\nPhoebe Ferro as Alice\nSkyler Peters as Jodie A'Dale\nCharlie Stover as Hazel A'Dale\nDanielle Hoetmer as Julie A'Dale\nLio Tipton as Anna-Freya Hollyhock\nCharles Halford as John Redrye\nLorelei Mote as Petal Hollyhock\nWeston Razooli as Marty Hollyhock\nRachel Browne as Suds Hollyhock\nAndrea Browne as Kels Hollyhock\nAustin Archer as Chip\nAbigail Sakari as Otomo Angel\nChuck Marra as Otomo Pete\nLonzo Liggins as Officer Neff\nSorhab Mirmont as DJ M\u00e4rz\nKent Richards as Officer Lucas\nProduction[edit]\nRiddle of Fire was shot on 16 mm film by cinematographer Jake L.
