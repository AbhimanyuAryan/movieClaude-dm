It tells the story of Rocky and Ginger who lead a rescue mission when their daughter has been abducted to a highly-advanced poultry farm run by their old enemy Mrs. Tweedy.\nChicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget had its world premiere at the 67th London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, and was released by Netflix on 15 December 2023. The film received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot\nSince the chickens escaped from Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy's Farm,[a] they have settled in an idyllic sanctuary on an island in a lake, where they can live happily, safe from humans. Ginger and Rocky start a family with a hatchling named Molly. The rats Nick and Fetcher visit periodically with supplies.\nMolly grows into an adventurous 11-year-old, whom Ginger and Rocky try to protect from the outside world. The appearance of trucks and construction on the mainland concern Ginger that another chicken farm is being built, and with her more cautious perspective as a parent, she leads her community in better hiding themselves.\nMolly's curiosity draws her to sneak away to the mainland, where she is saved from being run over by a teenage chicken named Frizzle. The two friends stow away on a truck full of chickens being taken to Fun-Land Farms, which looks appealing to them. Ginger and Rocky form a search party with chickens Babs, Bunty, Mac, and Fowler; they give chase and find that the \"farm\" is a highly-advanced poultry processing plant bristling with security systems.\nInside, Molly and Frizzle find an expansive amusement area, where the other chickens \u2013 all wearing numbered electronic collars \u2013 go on rides, play games, etc. Rocky impulsively catapults into the compound, inadvertently activating various security systems, giving Ginger and the others the info they need to infiltrate. They are joined by Nick and Fetcher, who are separated from the others, but meet up with Rocky.\nMolly and Frizzle discover that the collars turn the other chickens into carefree idiots when activated. Frizzle is caught by the facility's scientist Dr Fry and given a collar; Molly leaves, promising to come back for her.\nGinger reunites with Molly, and learns in horror that her nemesis Mrs. Tweedy is running the operation alongside Dr. Fry, her new husband. The collars serve to suppress the chickens' fear, to make tastier chicken nuggets for Reginald Smith, a fast-food chain businessman looking for new food items. Mrs. Tweedy captures Ginger and puts a collar on her, which she resists unsuccessfully, but Rocky intervenes and Molly frees her. The hens, rooster, and rats are reunited in a corn silo, which they escape by turning it into popcorn. Molly mourns the fate of Frizzle, prompting Ginger and the others to turn back and help the other chickens as well.\nMrs. Tweedy orders Dr. Fry to start production of chicken nuggets, beginning a struggle for the remote control that brainwashes the chickens, between Mrs. Tweedy and the team of Rocky, Ginger, and Molly, while the rest of the rescue squad try to hold back the chickens marching mindlessly into the processor. The chicken trio win the fight, sending Mrs. Tweedy into the machine to be breaded like a chicken nugget, while the whole population of chickens and the rats escape in a truck. Mrs. Tweedy tries to stop them, but Fowler knocks her into the compound's moat, where she is stopped by the facility's security, as the site explodes from the chickens' sabotage. \nThe chickens return to the island, and their life returns to normal, now with Molly and Frizzle doing aerial reconnaissance for chicken farms on the mainland, and the chicken crew liberating those they find.\n\nVoice cast\n\nThandiwe Newton as Ginger, a British chicken and Rocky's wife\nArchive recordings of Julia Sawalha as Ginger in the first film are used in flashback sequences\nZachary Levi as Rocky, an American former circus rooster and Ginger's husband\nBella Ramsey as Molly, the daughter of Ginger and Rocky\nImelda Staunton as Bunty, a cynical chicken and former champion egg-layer\nLynn Ferguson as Mac, a Scottish nerdy chicken who is Ginger's assistant\nDavid Bradley as Fowler, an elderly rooster and former RAF mascot\nJane Horrocks as Babs, a dimwitted chicken who is adept at knitting\nRomesh Ranganathan as Nick, a cynical scavenger rat\nDaniel Mays as Fetcher, a comical rat who is Nick's partner\nJosie Sedgwick-Davies as Frizzle, a chicken whom Molly befriends\nPeter Serafinowicz as Reginald Smith, the owner of the Sir Eat-a-Lot chain of restaurants\nNick Mohammed as Dr. Fry, a scientist at Fun-Land Farms who is Mrs. Tweedy's second husband\nMiranda Richardson as Mrs. Melisha Tweedy, the chickens' former owner who now seeks revenge\nProduction\nAfter completing Chicken Run in 2000, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation and one of the film's executive producers, proposed to Aardman Animations the idea of making a sequel. However, Aardman declined as they felt unready to make a sequel as well as its employees feeling exhausted after completing the original film and instead moved on to different projects. Since then, ideas and talks of a sequel floated around for years until numerous crew members of the first film agreed to continue the story.[5]\nA sequel to Chicken Run was reported in April 2018 with Aardman Animations, StudioCanal and Path\u00e9 set to produce.[6] DreamWorks had no involvement due to ending their partnership with Aardman after the release of Flushed Away in 2006.[7] Sam Fell directed, with Paul Kewley producing.[8][9] Fell was approached by the film's original co-director Peter Lord in 2016 at a party and convinced him to return to Aardman to direct the sequel.[10] The original Chicken Run writers Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell returned to write for the sequel.[11] Aardman co-founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton served as executive producers as well as the film's original co-director Nick Park.[12][13][14]\nOn 16 October 2019, the film officially began pre-production.[15][16][17] Because very few props and models from the original film survived after being destroyed in a warehouse fire in 2005, Fell and his team resorted to use reference photos from the original film's making of book.[18] Aardman said that Mel Gibson was not asked to return as Rocky.[19] In June 2020, Fell released more details about the sequel, which would follow from the ending of the first film, where the chickens have settled into their new safe area. Molly, the chick of Ginger and Rocky, begins to outgrow the area, just as word of a new threat to the chickens arrives.[20] In July 2020, Julia Sawalha, the voice of Ginger in the first film, revealed Aardman's intention to recast her role, saying her voice now sounded too old, and commented \"I have officially been plucked, stuffed & roasted\". The decision was met with widespread criticism with some finding the decision ageist.[21][22]\nPrincipal photography commenced in early 2021.[23][24][25] In January 2022, Zachary Levi, Thandiwe Newton, David Bradley, Romesh Ranganathan and Daniel Mays replaced Gibson, Sawalha, Benjamin Whitrow, Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels as the voices of Rocky, Ginger, Fowler, Nick and Fetcher, while Jane Horrocks, Imelda Staunton and Lynn Ferguson reprised their roles as Babs, Bunty and Mac from the first film, with the film's title revealed as Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget.[26] Bella Ramsey, Nick Mohammed and Josie Sedgwick-Davies voiced three new characters, Molly, Dr. Fry and Frizzle, respectively.[26] In September 2023, it was announced that Miranda Richardson would reprise her role as the voice of Mrs. Tweedy and that Peter Serafinowicz also joined the cast as Reginald Smith, a \"slightly bemused businessman\".[27]\n\nMusic\nHarry Gregson-Williams, who previously scored the predecessor with John Powell, returned to score the film, marking his fifth collaboration with Aardman. It is also the second time Gregson-Williams scored a sequel to a film solely by himself after he composed its predecessor with Powell, the first being DreamWorks Animation's Shrek 2 (2004).[28]\n\nRelease\nChicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget premiered at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, with none of the cast in attendance due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, with the film's characters walking the red carpet in their place.[29] It was released on Netflix on 15 December 2023.[30][31][32] The film had a preview at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on 11 June 2023.[33] Netflix purchased the worldwide distribution rights to the film, excluding China.[20]\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 108 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget offers more of the easy laughs and eye-catching animation that fans of the original enjoyed, although there's a general feeling of diminishing returns.\"[34] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[35]\nJohn Nugent for Empire magazine wrote, \"the ambition and technical scope are markedly bolder\" than its predecessor Chicken Run, adding it is \"silly, witty, extremely British \u2014 this is a family film made with a very Aardman-y kind of craft and care\".[36]\n\nAccolades\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\n15 November 2023\n\nBest Original Score \u2014 Animated Film\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society\n\n19 December 2023\n\nBest Animated Picture\n\nChicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget\n\nNominated\n\n[38]\n\n\nVisual Effects Society Awards\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nOutstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Feature\n\nJon Biggins, Jim Lewis, Charles Copping, Matthew Perry\n\nNominated\n\n[39]\n\n\nOutstanding Created Environment in an Animated Feature\n\nCharles Copping, Matthew Perry, Jim Lewis, Jon Biggins(for Chicken Island)\n\nNominated\n\n\nBritish Academy Film Awards\n\nFebruary 18, 2024\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nSam Fell, Leyla Hobart and Steve Pegram\n\nNominated\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ As depicted in Chicken Run (2000).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b c Baughan, Nikki. \"Chicken Run: Dawn Of The Nugget: London Review\".
