Following Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), it is the second remake of the 1922 German Expressionist film of the same name written by Henrik Galeen and directed by F. W. Murnau, which in turn is an \"unauthorized and unofficial\" adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula.\nDevelopment on the film began in 2015, following the release of The Witch. Eggers planned to make it his second film, describing it as a passion project, but eventually opted to delay production and go on to direct The Lighthouse and The Northman instead. Frequent collaborator Anya Taylor-Joy was attached to the project earlier, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Skarsg\u00e5rd and Lily-Rose Depp were cast as leads in September 2022. Nicholas Hoult joined the cast the following month, with the remaining cast confirmed in early 2023. Filming primarily took place in and around Prague between February and May 2023.\nNosferatu is a co-production of Studio 8, and Maiden Voyage Pictures, and is set to be released theatrically on December 25, 2024, by Focus Features.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nRobert Eggers' Nosferatu is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.\u2014\u200aFocus Features[2]\nCast[edit]\n\nBill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Count Orlok\nNicholas Hoult as Thomas Hutter\nLily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter\nAaron Taylor-Johnson as Friedrich Harding\nEmma Corrin as Anna Harding\nWillem Dafoe as Professor Albin Eberhart Von Franz\nSimon McBurney as Herr Knock\nRalph Ineson as Dr. Wilhelm Sievers\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn July 2015, a remake of Nosferatu was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing. The film was intended to be produced by Jay Van Hoy and Lars Knudsen for Studio 8.[3] In November 2016, Eggers expressed surprise that the Nosferatu remake was going to be his second film, saying, \"It feels ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting for a filmmaker in my place to do Nosferatu next. I was really planning on waiting a while, but that's how fate shook out.\"[4] During an interview with Den of Geek around the release of The Lighthouse in 2019, Robert Eggers revealed that although he had dedicated a lot of time to bringing the iconic horror film into the 21st century, he didn't know when or if it would happen. Despite that, Eggers said, \"Look, I spent so many years and so much time, just so much blood on it, yeah, it would be a real shame if it never happened\".[5]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn an interview with Den of Geek around the release of The Northman, Eggers was asked if he and Anya Taylor-Joy still communicated about the project, saying, \"We definitely talk about it, and I don't know why it's been so hard to make happen.\"[6] It was revealed in March 2022 that English singer Harry Styles was briefly attached to an undisclosed role in the film, but eventually dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[7]\nIn September 2022, it was announced that Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd was set to star in the titular Nosferatu, Count Orlok, with Lily-Rose Depp also attached to co-star.[8] Nicholas Hoult entered negotiations the following month to join the cast, with all three confirmed to star by January 2023 alongside the addition of Willem Dafoe, who had previously portrayed Max Schreck/Count Orlok in the 2000 film Shadow of the Vampire.[9][10] Emma Corrin would join the cast the following month.[11] Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Simon McBurney, and Ralph Ineson were revealed to be in the cast at the start of production in late February 2023.[12][13]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in the Czech Republic on February 20, 2023.[14][15] Some exterior shots were also captured in Romania. Among the noteworthy filming locations was the 14th-century Ro\u017emit\u00e1l Castle in Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod Trem\u0161\u00ednem and Prague's Invalidovna complex, a Baroque building registered as a national landmark.[16] Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke revealed that the film was shot in color and was reminiscent of 19th-century Romanticism.[17] Filming wrapped on May 19, 2023.[18][19]\n\nRelease[edit]\nNosferatu is scheduled to be released on December 25, 2024, by  Focus Features domestically and Universal Pictures internationally.[20][21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kroll, Justin (March 3, 2023). \"Aaron Taylor-Johnson Joins Robert Eggers' Nosferatu Movie For Focus\".
