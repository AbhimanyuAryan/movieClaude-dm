It was released on Apple Music on August 7 and on YouTube on August 15.\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nIn interstitial segments, Travis Scott and Rick Rubin have a conversation about Scott\u2019s current feelings. These segments were directed by Harmony Korine.\n\nTil Further Notice[edit]\nThis segment is directed by Valdimar J\u00f3hannsson.[a] Travis Scott is seen walking around mountains in Iceland, and enters an enormous cave, where he is attacked by a monstrous octopus. After the octopus lets go, he continues to trek the mountains and coastline of Iceland, which seamlessly leads into the first conversation between Rubin and Scott.\n\nHyaena[edit]\nThis segment is directed by Andrew Dosunmu,[a] and serves as the music video for \"Hyaena\". Travis Scott was spotted visiting a village in the Kano State of Nigeria for the video,[4] which consists of documentary footage of Scott and life in the village.\n\nSirens[edit]\nThis segment is directed by Travis Scott and the Spanish production company CANADA, and serves as the music video for \"Sirens\". Parts of the segment were filmed in Tarragona, Spain. [5] In this segment, a crowd of people are running around town into an arena, where it's revealed that they're forming a castell around Scott.\n\nDelresto[edit]\nThis segment is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn,[a] and serves as the music video for \"Delresto (Echoes)\". In this segment, Scott is in a blue taxi where his eerily masked driver recklessly careens around in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nModern Jam[edit]\nFilmed in Paris, this segment is directed by Gaspar No\u00e9,[a] and serves as the music video for \"Modern Jam\". In this segment, Scott is DJing at a club. The video has heavy epileptic imagery with 1980s-style transitions throughout the segment.\n\nPompeii[edit]\nThis segment is directed by Harmony Korine,[a] and consists of concert footage of Scott performing at the Amphitheatre of Pompeii in Pompeii, Italy.\nSong list:\n\n\"Hyaena\"\n\"Thank God\"\n\"Modern Jam\" (performed alongside Teezo Touchdown)\n\"My Eyes\"\n\"God's Country\"\n\"Sirens\"\n\"Fe!n\" (performed alongside Sheck Wes)[b]\n\"Circus Maximus\"\n\"Delresto (Echoes)\"\n\"Parasail\" (performed alongside Yung Lean)\n\"Til Further Notice\" (performed alongside James Blake)\n\"Telekinesis\"\nCast[edit]\nTravis Scott\nRick Rubin\nJames Blake\nSheck Wes\nYung Lean\nTeezo Touchdown\nJazzelle\nRaysCorruptedMind\nRelease and promotion[edit]\nOn July 23, 2023, Scott announced the title of the film at the end of his performance at Rolling Loud Miami 2023.[6] On July 25, 2023, Scott announced the film on his social media and released a trailer and poster of the movie. Although the official poster states that it was produced by A24, the company has denied any involvement with the film. [7]\nCircus Maximus was released at select AMC Theatres in the U.S. on July 27, 2023. [8] All attendees were given a free promotional T-shirt.[9] On August 7, 2023 the film was released on Apple Music, hours after Scott performed in Rome.[10] On August 15, 2023, the film was uploaded on YouTube alongside the music videos for \"Hyaena\", \"Sirens\", \"Modern Jam\", and \"Delresto (Echoes)\", which were included in the film.
