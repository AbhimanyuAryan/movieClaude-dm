He is estranged from his wife and son and dates a Cracovian immigrant named Annie, who shares his love for books. Knox is later diagnosed with a fast-moving form of dementia called Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. He quickly makes arrangements to cash out and retire from the business. Before that, he undertakes one last job with his partner, Thomas Muncie.\nDuring the job, after successfully killing his target, Knox accidentally kills Muncie in his dementia-fueled confusion. He quickly stages the scene and leaves. That night, he is suddenly visited by his estranged son Miles, who tearfully admits to killing a man for raping his daughter, Knox's granddaughter. Knox instructs his son to remain quiet to the authorities as he later arrives at the crime scene and meticulously removes evidence that may incriminate Miles, while mysteriously storing them away for later use. Meanwhile, dogged detective Emily Ikari is on both murder cases, determined to pinpoint the perpetrator.\nKnox later visits his friend and boss Xavier Crane, a crime lord. Together, they cook up a plan to set Knox's family up for life while leaving the business behind, all while Knox battles his fading mental state. Meanwhile, Detective Ikari links both crimes to a single perpetrator. She interrogates Knox to no effect. Using the evidence he had previously stored away, he planted them around his son Miles' home, seemingly betraying him. Miles is arrested for the murder of his daughter's rapist, and is confronted by Knox in prison, where he accuses Miles of ratting him out in a tax evasion case several years prior. After getting lost in the woods after digging up his stash of diamonds at a cabin his family used to own, Knox is picked up by Crane and driven home. Upon reaching home, he is confronted by a group of burglars and Annie, who clued in to Knox's dementia and the fact that he had been cashing out and ratted him out as a result. Killing them all, Knox confronts Annie at gunpoint and informs her that she would have gotten a share anyways. She was spared of her life and would in the end only receives the books instead. Despondent, Knox calls Xavier, who wishes him fortune before informing the police as part of their plan, whereupon he is arrested by Detective Ikari. The police later discover signs that the evidence found at Miles Knox's house may have been tampered with, and planted there by Knox, leading to the conclusion that Knox may have framed his own son for the murder. When asked by Ikari on a possible motive, Miles, recalling his father's accusation to him in prison, responds accordingly, shifting the blame fully over to Knox. He is then released.\nSeveral weeks later, Miles visits his father in prison. Knox, now having fully lost his mental faculties, does not recognize his own son and is later moved from prison to a medical facility, having only weeks left to live. Miles, and his mother have now received equal share of Knox's fortune, ensuring the completion of his retirement plan. Annie receives his library and opens the cover of A Tale of Two Cities.The film ends with a catatonic Knox staring out of a window.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nMichael Keaton as John \"Aristotle\" Knox\nAl Pacino as Xavier Crane\nMarcia Gay Harden as Ruby Knox\nJames Marsden as Miles Knox\nSuzy Nakamura as Detective Emily Ikari\nJohn Hoogenakker as Detective Rale\nJoanna Kulig as Annie\nRay McKinnon as Thomas Muncie\nLela Loren as Cheryl Knox\nDennis Dugan as Philo Jones\nProduction[edit]\nMichael Keaton directed the film from a script by Gregory Poirier.[3] Principal photography took place from October to December 2022 in Los Angeles.[4][5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nKnox Goes Away had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2023.[6][1] In November 2023, Saban Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, later scheduling the film for a theatrical release on March 15, 2024.[7][8]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 61% of 70 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10.
