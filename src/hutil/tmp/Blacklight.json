(November 2023)\nSofia Flores was an inspiring political activist who had the courage to make a stand for what she believed in. On a recent visit to Washington, D.C., she gave an impassioned speech at a rally for women's and racial equality. Despite facing countless threats and warnings, Sofia continued to speak out against the injustices she faced. That evening, after the rally had ended, she made her way home, unfortunately unaware of the fate that awaited her. In a devastating and deliberate act, Sofia was killed in a hit-and-run attack right outside her home. Her death shocked the nation and sparked outrage over the blatant lack of protection for activists like her. Sofia is now remembered everywhere as a brave champion of women's and racial equality and her legacy serves as an inspiration for other activists to speak out despite the risks.\nTravis Block is a Vietnam War veteran who works in the shadows for FBI Director Gabriel Robinson. His job is to handle difficult tasks with discretion. He's been with the bureau for many years, but now that his daughter and granddaughter are getting older, he longs to retire and spend more time with them. Unfortunately, Robinson is reluctant to let him go and assigns him a new mission, to find and bring in undercover FBI Agent Dusty Crane. Block is dissatisfied with the assignment but his loyalty to the bureau forces him to accept it. Knowing that this could take a long time, Travis knows that it will delay his life plans of spending time with his family, but he also knows that it is his duty to complete his last mission. He still hasn't given up hope that he will come out of this mission in time and be able to near his family sooner or later.\nHowever, Crane goes rogue and contacts Mira Jones, a journalist, claiming to have information about the murder of Flores. Despite being relentlessly pursued by Block, an extremely skilled special agent, and the FBI, Crane manages to escape on more than a few occasions. He arranges to meet with Jones at a museum, where Block follows the journalist to the meeting. However, Crane foils each of Block's attempts to apprehend him and escapes yet again. Just before Crane is shot dead by two FBI Agents, he reveals to Block that it was Robinson, a powerful underworld figure who had ordered the killing of Flores. The revelation comes too late for both the criminal and the special agent, signalling the tragic end of their deadly game of hide and seek.\nBlock and Jones had a chance to meet again and catch up. But their reunion was quickly met with grim news, Jones had heard from Crane that the FBI had a top secret program called Operation Unity. According to Crane, it was being run by Robinson, and it involved killing innocent civilians such as Flores. Horrified, Block had to do something. He went directly to Robinson and asked him what was going on with Operation Unity. However, Robinson didn't give him any satisfactory answers, instead warning Block that he should stay out of it and implicitly threatened his family. This didn't sit well with Block, prompting him to do his own investigation into the matter.\nWhen Drew, Jones' editor, sends Jones home and writes the story about the mysterious deaths of Crane and Flores. That night, on his way home, the same two FBI agents that killed Crane and Flores cause a car accident that results in his death. While the news of Drew\u2019s death weighs heavily on Jones and colleagues, Block is concerned that his family had suddenly gone missing. Jones and her colleagues began to connect the dots from the mysterious deaths and Block investigates the disappearance of the family. \nBlock goes to Robinson\u2019s house and forces him to give him a hard drive in his safe which contains all the records of the FBI\u2019s activities. Block is waylaid by several of Robinson\u2019s men but manages to escape.\nJones and Block manage to obtain the information on the hard drive regarding Operation Unity and discover that the operation is a government-backed infiltration and sabotage plan. The plan involves using advanced technology to spy on foreign organizations and sabotage their operations from within. The plan has been in motion for several years and is nearing completion. Jones and Block realize that if the information falls into the wrong hands, it could cause irreparable damage not only to their country but to the world. They must act fast and find a way to stop the operation in its tracks before it's too late. With the help of their allies, they formulate a plan to expose Operation Unity to the world and put a stop to it once and for all.\nThe review of the hard drive by Block and Jones revealed that Crane had developed feelings for his assignment, Flores. Robinson had Crane completely fooled, playing on his feelings in order to make sure he stayed on task. After Crane became too attached to Flores, Robinson had her killed and disposed of. Block confronted Robinson with the evidence he had found, leading to Robinson admitting that his mission was part of a government cover-up, Operation Unity. With all the evidence stacked up, Robinson had no choice but to turn himself in to the authorities and confess to his crimes. With justice served and the truth uncovered, Jones was able to complete her story about the government plot; while Block, having accomplished his mission, retired from his profession and was finally reunited with his family who had been in Witness Protection for a considerable amount of time. They could all now finally come home together in peace.\n\nCast[edit]\nLiam Neeson as Travis Block[5][6]\nEmmy Raver-Lampman as Mira Jones\nTaylor John Smith[7] as Dusty Crane\nAidan Quinn[7] as Gabriel Robinson\nClaire van der Boom as Amanda Block\nYael Stone as Helen Davidson\nTim Draxl as Drew Hawthorne\nGeorgia Flood as Pearl\nMelanie Jarnson as Sofia Flores\nAndrew Shaw as Jordan Lockhart\nZac Lemons as Wallace\nGabriella Sengos as Natalie Block\nDaniel Turbill as Running Man\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography of the film started in November 2020 in Melbourne, Australia.[1][8][5] In January 2021 it was announced that a car chase scene would be filmed in Canberra.[9][10]\nMark Isham composed the film score.
