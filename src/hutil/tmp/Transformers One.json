It is the eighth installment overall of the Transformers film series, as well as the first animated feature film based on the franchise since The Transformers: The Movie (1986). Directed by Josh Cooley and written by Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari and Bobby Rubio, the ensemble voice cast includes Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi, Laurence Fishburne, and Jon Hamm. The film is described as an \"origin story\" set on the planet Cybertron and will center on the relationship between Optimus Prime and Megatron, and the circumstances that lead to them becoming archenemies and the respective leaders of the Autobots and Decepticons.\nIn March 2015, following the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Paramount Pictures tasked Akiva Goldsman with working with Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg, and Lorenzo di Bonaventura to set up a writer's room to create ideas for potential future Transformers films. By May, Barrer and Ferrari had joined the writers' room, and one of the ideas that came from there was an animated prequel that would be set on Cybertron. The film was announced in August 2017, and by April 2020, Cooley had been hired to direct. The title and voice cast were revealed in April 2023, with the animation provided by Industrial Light & Magic.\nTransformers One is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on September 20, 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nDescribed as an \"origin story\" set on the planet Cybertron, the film will center on the relationship between Optimus Prime and Megatron going from brothers-in-arms to archenemies, and the foundations of the factions they will lead and come into conflict as Autobots and Decepticons.[2]\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nMain article: List of Transformers film series cast and characters\nChris Hemsworth as Orion Pax / Optimus Prime[3][4]\nBrian Tyree Henry as D-16 / Megatron[3][5]\nScarlett Johansson as Elita-1[3]\nKeegan-Michael Key as B-127 / Bumblebee[3]\nSteve Buscemi as the film's antagonist[1][6]\nLaurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion[3]\nJon Hamm as Sentinel Prime[3]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nFollowing the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Paramount Pictures tasked Akiva Goldsman, who would later serve as a co-story writer for Transformers: The Last Knight (2017), in March 2015 to work with the film franchise's director, Michael Bay, executive producer, Steven Spielberg, and producer, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, in setting up a \"writer's room\" to create ideas for potential future Transformers films and spin-off films.[7] After setting up the writer's room, multiple writers were hired to write future installments in the franchise. According to Goldsman, the team would look at various Transformers media created by Hasbro for inspiration; if they found one that interested them, they could submit a treatment, which would then be further developed by the whole team.[8] In late May, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari had joined the writer's room. According to Deadline Hollywood, one of the ideas that came from the writer's room had the working title Transformers One[9] and would serve as an animated prequel focusing on the Autobot\u2013Decepticon conflict that began on Cybertron.[10][11]\nIn August 2017, it was reported that an animated Transformers film was officially in the works.[12] Following the release of Bumblebee (2018), di Bonaventura discussed the animated film, clarifying that it was \"in the works\" and would \"tell the whole Cybertron mythology\".[13] Bumblebee director Travis Knight additionally expressed interest in the film.[14][15]\n\nThe film's title was revealed at the 2023 CinemaCon.\nIn April 2020, it was reported that Josh Cooley had been hired to direct the film and was overseeing the script by Barrer and Ferrari. Hasbro Entertainment and Paramount Animation would produce the film.[2] In February 2022, it emerged that the film would be computer-animated.[16] In December 2022, the title was reported to be Transformers: A New Generation, though di Bonaventura later stated in April 2023 that the title had yet to be finalized.[17][18] Later that month, at CinemaCon, the title was officially confirmed as Transformers One.[3] di Bonaventura stated that the plot will center around the origins of the Transformers, and explore the events that lead Optimus and Megatron to go from being brothers-in-arms to becoming enemies.[19] In June, Steve Desmond was revealed to be a writer on the film.[4]\n\nCasting[edit]\nThe voice cast of the film was announced at CinemaCon in April 2023, consisting of Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry as younger versions of Optimus Prime and Megatron, respectively, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Jon Hamm, and Laurence Fishburne headlining.[3] In April 2024, Steve Buscemi, who had previously voiced Daytrader in The Last Knight, was cast as the film's antagonist.[1][6]\n\n\n\nWhen we first listen to Chris Hemsworth's voice, you're like, 'God, is he gonna be a good Optimus!' Obviously, he starts as Orion Pax and you don't become Optimus for a while, so he's not playing, for most of the movie, what we think of as Optimus, Peter Cullen. So it's that transition, and Chris's voice has a timbre that\u2026 it\u2019s logical that Peter Cullen would take over that voice, if you would, which is really great, the fans are gonna really feel great.\n\n\n\u00a0\u2014 Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura on Chris Hemsworth's casting as Optimus Prime.[4]\n\nTransformers One marks Hemsworth's first animated feature film. The actor joined the project after being impressed with the screenplay. Hemsworth made efforts to not use his regular speaking voice for Optimus Prime.[20] Hemsworth revealed during CinemaCon 2024 that he had consulted with Peter Cullen on providing his voice.[21] Cooley requested that Key stay close to his regular speaking voice for Bumblebee.[22]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nIndustrial Light & Magic, who had provided the visual effects for the prior live-action Transformers installments, returned to provide the animation for the film.[23] The film was in post-production by February 2024.[24]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTransformers One is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on September 20, 2024, by Paramount Pictures.[25] It was originally scheduled to be released on July 19, 2024,[26] but was initially delayed to September 13,[27] before shifting a week later to its current date.[25]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn April 2023, di Bonaventura stated that there is discussion for Transformers One to become a trilogy of films.[19] By June, he confirmed that the story is mapped out to progress over three movies, detailing the progression of the characters into their depiction in the live-action film series. The producer explained that Hemsworth's depiction will grow into the leader depicted in the previous installments, stating that the transition from Hemsworth's voice to Peter Cullen's will make sense within the story.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Gardner, Chris (April 11, 2024). \"Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson and Brian Tyree Henry Debut Origin Story 'Transformers One'\".
