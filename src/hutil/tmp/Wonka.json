It tells the origin story of Willy Wonka, a character in the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, depicting his early days as a chocolatier.[6] The film stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the title character, with an ensemble cast including Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton, Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, Olivia Colman, and Hugh Grant. It is the third live-action film based on Dahl's novel, following Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005).\nDevelopment began when Warner Bros. Pictures reacquired the rights to the character in October 2016 and announced that the film would be an origin story. While it tells an original story with no connection to any prior adaptation, King developed the film to exist as a \"companion piece\" to the 1971 film by reprising some of the music, thematic elements, and the visual design of the Oompa Loompas.[7] In May 2021, Chalamet was confirmed to portray Wonka, and the supporting cast was announced in September of that year. Filming began in the United Kingdom in September, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in Watford, as well as Oxford, Lyme Regis, Bath, St Albans, and at the Rivoli Ballroom in Crofton Park, London.[8] The film's original songs were written by Neil Hannon, and its original score by Joby Talbot.\nWonka premiered in London at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre on November 28, 2023 and was released in the United Kingdom on December 8 and in the United States on December 15 by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $632 million worldwide against a $125 million budget and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2023. It received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film, and Chalamet was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nWilly Wonka, an aspiring magician, inventor, and chocolatier, arrives in Europe to establish his chocolate shop at The Gal\u00e9ries Gourmet. Burning through his meager savings, he is coerced to stay at Mrs. Scrubitt's boarding house by her henchman Bleacher and, despite orphan Noodle's warning about the fine print, signs a contract because he is illiterate. To pay them off, Wonka introduces \"hoverchocs\", chocolates that make people fly, facing opposition from three rival chocolatiers who call the Chief of Police to confiscate Wonka's earnings for disrupting trade and selling without a chocolate store.\nUnable to pay the expensive fees imposed on him by the contract, Wonka is captured and forced to work in a laundry for Mrs. Scrubitt alongside five other captives, including Noodle. Learning of a \"Chocolate Cartel\" plot involving the rival chocolatiers, he makes his escape with the help of Noodle; while he promises her a lifetime supply of chocolates, she promises to teach him how to read. Wonka tells Noodle that his affinity for chocolate stems from his late mother, and also alludes to the theft of his chocolates by an enigmatic little orange man. The Cartel meanwhile bribe the sweet-toothed Chief by providing him with his own supply of chocolates, inducing him to force Wonka to leave town. \nTo produce his signature chocolate, Wonka and Noodle travel to the local zoo, milking Abigail the giraffe. Together with the other laundry workers, they embark on a chocolate-selling crusade to alleviate their debts while using tunnels underneath the city to evade the police. The persistent thief of Wonka's chocolates is unmasked as an Oompa Loompa named Lofty, who reveals that the Oompa Loompas seek retribution for the cocoa beans Wonka originally took from Loompaland under Lofty's watch. Wonka captures Lofty, but Lofty dupes Wonka into freeing him; he strikes Wonka with a frying pan and snatches a jar of chocolates before disappearing.\nUsing the funds raised from selling chocolates, Wonka and the laundry workers open Wonka's dream chocolate store. The Chief and the Cartel, who are now unable to arrest him since he has a legitimate shop, expose him to Scrubitt. Infusing his chocolates with Yeti sweat, Scrubitt incites chaos among the customers, leading to the destruction of Wonka's store. Wonka reluctantly agrees to the Cartel's offer to leave town by ship to pay off everyone's debts. Because of this, all of the workers are released from the laundry except Noodle; Cartel leader Arthur Slugworth pays Scrubitt to keep her there indefinitely. Wonka deduces that Noodle and Slugworth are related, before he and Lofty are forced to jump off the boat, as it is rigged to explode. After rescuing Noodle, Wonka and the group devise a strategy to obtain the Cartel's incriminating account book.\nUsing Abigail as a distraction, Wonka and Noodle infiltrate the Cartel's base, where they are confronted by the Cartel. Slugworth discloses that after the death of Noodle's father, his own brother Zebedee, he falsely reported Noodle as deceased to her mother, Dorothy Smith, and gave her to Scrubitt in order to eliminate her claim to the family fortune. Held at gunpoint, Wonka and Noodle are nearly drowned in a vault of chocolate, but Lofty rescues them.\nWonka and Noodle expose the Cartel's misdeeds to the authorities and the public. They release the Cartel's chocolate reserve through a fountain, now laced with Wonka's unique ingredients, ruining the Cartel's enterprise. The Cartel meets their downfall as they are arrested by the police, along with the corrupt Chief. The public revels in tasting Wonka's chocolate, and Wonka unwraps the last chocolate bar his mother had given him, discovering a golden paper with a message stating that \"The secret is it's not the chocolate that matters, but the people you share it with.\" He splits the bar into six pieces to share with his friends before reuniting Noodle with her mother Dorothy. He then settles his debt with Lofty and finds an abandoned castle for sale to start building his own chocolate factory, with Lofty as his tasting chef.\nWonka's friends return to their old lives. Scrubitt and Bleacher attempt to eliminate the evidence of sabotaging Wonka's shop, but they are arrested for their complicity in the Cartel's scheme.\n\nCast[edit]\nSee also: List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet portrayed the title character in the film\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Willy Wonka, a young aspiring magician, inventor, and chocolatier with a difficult dream to open his very own chocolate shop[9]\nColin O'Brien as 10-year-old Willy Wonka[9]\nCalah Lane as Noodle, an orphan who becomes Wonka's assistant.

Raymond as a map seller\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn October 2016, Warner Bros. Pictures reacquired the rights to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964) character Willy Wonka from Roald Dahl's estate, with a film in development from producers David Heyman and Michael Siegel.[19] The announcement of the project was met with a mostly negative response as it came less than two months following the death of Gene Wilder, who portrayed Willy Wonka in the 1971 film adaptation.[20] The following month, Heyman revealed that the project would not be a third straight adaptation of the book: \"They've done two films, quite different. But it's possibly an origin story. We're just in the early stages of it, working with a writer called Simon Rich, which is wonderful.\"[21] In February 2018, it was announced Paul King was in negotiations to direct.[22][23] He ultimately decided against completing his Paddington films, as he had been satisfied with his first two films and felt \"it was time to let go and give somebody else a shot\".[24] That year, it was revealed that the film would be a prequel to the events of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.[25] King grew up as a fan of both the book and the 1971 film adaptation and enjoyed Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation as an adult.[26] \"I was a bit nervous because origin stories don't always feel essential, and I was aware this is such a beloved property,\" he said.[27] King's hiring as director, as well as the project's title, Wonka, was announced in January 2021.[28]\n\nWriting[edit]\nAfter being approached by Heyman to direct, King felt the urge to revisit Dahl's book and was surprised: \"I realised that it's also an amazing emotional masterpiece. I really wasn't expecting that. Or maybe I had forgotten how incredibly touching it is. Poor little Charlie suffers so much. And you're so rooting for him. I found myself in tears at the end of it.\"[29] While looking through Dahl's archives & unpublished material for research, King found that Dahl had expressed interest in exploring Wonka's backstory but never went far with it.[30] King wanted the film to be a prequel to both the book and the 1971 film adaptation; as such, he decided to set it 25 years before the events of the story.[31] He set the story during the 1940s and paid homage to classic European story books.[32] He worked closely with the Dahl estate, particularly producer Luke Kelly, who is Dahl's grandson.[33] Creating the supporting characters, King was inspired by several of Dahl's other stories: the trio of villains, the \"Chocolate Cartel\", drew inspiration from Boggis, Bunce, and Bean from Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox; and the character of Mrs. Scrubitt was inspired by Dahl's short story \"The Landlady\".[27] He also stated Slugworth's chocolate cartel as being a \"savage indictment of capitalism\", wanting each character to represent a different aspect of greed, whereas Wonka had epitomized generosity and dedicated his life in creating his factory.[24][34] King developed the screenplay with his Paddington 2 (2017) collaborator Simon Farnaby, with additional material from Jeff Nathanson, Simon Rich, and Simon Stephenson.[35][36] He did not consider the film a musical, but \"a movie with songs\", noting that the Oompa Loompas sang in the book and Dahl's usage of poetry.[37] He cited Oliver! (1968), Cabaret (1972), Bugsy Malone (1976), and Annie (1982) as inspirations, particularly focusing on Oliver! as he felt Dahl's book was influenced by Charles Dickens.[31] When writing the screenplay, King did not want to \"reinvent\" the 1971 film and envisioned his film as being a \"companion piece\".[30]\n\nCasting[edit]\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Tom Holland were the frontrunners for the title role after King joined the project.[38] Donald Glover, Ryan Gosling, and Ezra Miller were previously considered for the role.[39] According to Paul King, \"We were pretty open to looking for the right person. But, for me, it really was a list of one.\" King was impressed with Chalamet's performances in Call Me by Your Name (2017) and Lady Bird (2017).[29] King offered the actor the part with no audition after seeing his high school performances on YouTube, which proved his vocal and dancing skills.[40] Chalamet grew up as a fan of both the 1971 and 2005 films and wanted to portray the character in a different way from Wilder and Johnny Depp: \"It was a total inverse of that Willy Wonka with a demented look in his eye that we all know. How would that character have started, to land in a place where he's still childlike but sort of broken?\"[41] King likened Chalamet's Wonka to \"a Charlie Chaplin innocent character, almost like the immigrant tramp figure coming to this world for the first time, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and completely naive \u2013 with this childlike wonder but none of the street smarts that he's going to develop over the next 25 years.\"[31] Chalamet was officially cast in May 2021 and was paid $9 million for his involvement.[42][43]\nIn September 2021, it was announced Keegan-Michael Key, Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, Olivia Colman, and Jim Carter were among the newest additions to the cast, with Farnaby also set for a role.[44][45] Unlike the 1971 and 2005 films, Wonka is the first film to not feature the Oompa-Loompas portrayed by dwarf actors. The casting of Hugh Grant as Lofty generated backlash from the dwarfism community.[46]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in the United Kingdom in September 2021,[47] with Seamus McGarvey as cinematographer, Nathan Crowley as production designer,[48] Mark Everson as film editor, and Lindy Hemming as costume designer.[45] Filming took place at historic Lyme Regis and Bath,[49][50][51] at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Watford,[52][53] and the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, London.[54] By December, McGarvey exited as cinematographer with Chung Chung-hoon replacing him.[55] Additional scenes were shot in Oxford in December and February.[56][57]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nGraham Page served as the visual effects supervisor, while Dominic Sidoli served as the visual effects producer. Visual effects vendors included Framestore, Outpost VFX, Goldcrest VFX, and Host VFX, providing over 1,163 shots.[58][59]\n\nMusic and soundtrack[edit]\nMain article: Wonka (soundtrack)\nNeil Hannon, lead singer of the Divine Comedy, wrote the film's original songs,[45] and the score was composed by Joby Talbot.[60] The soundtrack with the original songs and score was released by WaterTower Music on December 8, 2023.[61][62]\n\nRelease[edit]\nWonka had special screenings at ShowEast on October 24, 2023, and at the auditorium at Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads on November 19.[63][64] On November 20, the film had a special premiere in Tokyo, with a red carpet attended by director Paul King, producers David Heyman and Alexandra Derbyshire, and stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Hugh Grant. The film had its world premiere in London, at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, on November 28, 2023,[65] and was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2023,[66] followed by the United States, on December 15, 2023, in both conventional theaters and in Dolby Cinema and IMAX.[67] It was originally set for release on March 17, 2023.[28][68]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe marketing campaign from Warner Bros. Pictures for Wonka began on October 10, 2021, when Chalamet shared a photograph of himself in costume as Willy Wonka. The image was posted on Chalamet's Instagram with the caption \"The suspense is terrible, I hope it will last,\" a reference to a famous Wilder line in the 1971 film,[69][70] which itself is a quote from the 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde.[71] The Guardian noted that the image was met with mixed reception online.[72]\nOn April 26, 2022, footage of Chalamet as Willy Wonka was shared during Warner Bros. Pictures' presentation at CinemaCon. It also featured a rendition of the song \"Pure Imagination\" from the 1971 film.[73][6] Deadline described the trailer: \"Think Fantastic Beasts in regards to period (early 20th century), but so much more fun\".[74] The following year at the convention, Warner Bros. screened a teaser trailer for Wonka, which also saw a first-look at Grant as an Oompa-Loompa,[75][76] which caused criticism from actors with dwarfism, including Jason Acu\u00f1a, who remarked, \"So I guess Hugh Grant, you're now identifying as a little person\".[77] IndieWire praised Chalamet's transformation as Wonka remarking: \"like the chocolate he concocts in this first trailer, it will make you fly\".[6] The trailer was released to the public on July 11, 2023, alongside a teaser poster.[78] The film was also promoted during the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 23, 2023, in the form of a float called \"The Deliciously Delectable World of Wonka.\"[79][80] On November 27, 2023, IHOP introduced a Wonka Menu to promote the film.[81]\n\nHome media[edit]\nWonka was released for digital platforms on January 22, 2024, in the UK.[82] It was released by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on digital download on January 30, 2024 and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 27 in the US.[83] It is available for streaming exclusively on Max as of March 8, 2024.[84]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nAs of March\u00a029, 2024[update], Wonka has grossed $218.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $413.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $632.3 million.[4][5]\nOne week before its US theatrical release, Wonka grossed $43.2 million from 37 countries. The biggest totals were from the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland ($11.1 million), Mexico ($5.2 million), Spain ($4.4 million), Germany ($3.6 million), Italy ($3.4 million), China ($3.3 million), Japan ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($2 million).[85]\nIn the United States and Canada, Wonka was projected to gross around $40 million from 4,150 theaters in its opening weekend.[86] The film made $14.4 million on its first day, including $3.5 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut with $39 million, becoming the first live-action musical to top the box office in the post-COVID pandemic era.[87] It made $18.8 million in its second weekend (and a total of $28.4 million over the four-day Christmas frame), finishing second behind newcomer Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.[88] The film returned to the top of the box office in its third weekend, grossing $24 million with a 33% increase from the previous weekend.[89] Wonka retained the top spot at the box office in its fourth weekend, grossing $14.1 million with a decrease of 36% from its third weekend.[90][91]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 320 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With director Paul King at the helm and some solid new songs at the ready, the warmly old-fashioned Wonka puts a suitably sweet spin on the classic character while still leaving some room for the source material's darker undertones.\"[92] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[93] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 85% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[87]\nRotten Tomatoes found the initial reactions on social media to be mostly positive, with some reviewers criticizing the script and others praising Chalamet's performance and the film's presentation.[94] According to the website, critics found the film to be \"silly and fun for the whole family with catchy music and stunning production design, even if it loses some of the edge found in its predecessors.\"[95] The BBC reported that a number of critics likened the film tonally to the Paddington films, and despite \"several glowing reviews\", some felt that Wonka \"lacks the darker elements of previous versions\". Chalamet's performance was both praised and criticized for his singing, while some considered him miscast.[96]\nIn a 5 out of 5 star review, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film is \"spectacular, imaginative, sweet-natured and funny\". Although Bradshaw appreciated Chalamet's performance, finding it better than previous adaptations of the character, the film does not explain \"what happened to him as a young man to turn him into the somewhat ambiguous, even sinister adult figure with a streak of Dahlian cruelty\", wondering if in a possible sequel \"something happens to sour our young hero\".[97]\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety wrote that \"Wonka may be the squarest big-scale Hollywood musical in decades\" as a \"fun, rousing, impeccably staged, jaw-droppingly old-fashioned musical prequel\", but \"it might have been an even bigger hit had it been a little less sanded off for children\".[98] Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that \"Wonka is carefully calibrated to bring joy\" which is \"plenty of feel-goodism for one musical\", with \"grand but somehow flat-looking sets\" and \"with musical numbers that stress the importance of dreams and wonder and friendship\", but which \"gives us everything but that quiet, thrumming sensation\".[99]\nIn a more negative review, David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter found the film \"sickly sweet and hopelessly twee\" with the character of Willy Wonka \"neutered, stripped of any edge that might have made him interesting\" and that \"a number of gifted actors are either misused or wasted\".[100] Johnny Oleksinski of New York Post also pointed out that \"it's a shame that in this origin story the viewer doesn't leave with any deepened understanding of who Willy Wonka is\" and \"absent of any edge or layered characters\", stressing that \"Wonka is at its most enjoyable when you forget the novel\".[101]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAstra Film and Creative Awards\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\nBest Publicity Campaign\n\nWonka\n\nNominated\n\n[102]\n\n\nBAFTA Film Awards\n\nFebruary 18, 2024\n\nOutstanding British Film\n\nPaul King, David Heyman, Simon Farnaby, and Alexandra Derbyshire\n\nNominated\n\n[103]\n\n\nCritics' Choice Movie Awards\n\nJanuary 14, 2024\n\nBest Young Actor/Actress\n\nCalah Lane\n\nNominated\n\n[104]\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nLindy Hemming\n\nNominated\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nBest Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet\n\nNominated\n\n[105]\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nOriginal Song \u2014 Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film\n\nNeil Hannon, Simon Farnaby, and Paul King (\"A World of Your Own\")\n\nNominated\n\n[106]\n\n\nNeil Hannon, Simon Farnaby, and Paul King (\"You've Never Had Chocolate Like This\")\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Song \u2013 Onscreen Performance (Film)\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\"A World of Your Own\")\n\nNominated\n\n\nMusic Themed Film, Biopic, or Musical\n\nWonka\n\nNominated\n\n\nPeople's Choice Awards\n\nFebruary 18, 2024\n\nThe Comedy Movie of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n[107]\n\n\nThe Male Movie Star of the Year\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet\n\nNominated\n\n\nThe Comedy Movie Star of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n\nVisual Effects Society Awards\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nOutstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Feature\n\nDale Newton, Kunal Ayer, Valentina Ercolani, Gabor Foner(for Oompa Loompa)\n\nNominated\n\n[108]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn a September 2023 interview with Total Film, King expressed interest in making sequels, saying: \"Dahl was definitely interested in taking Willy Wonka on. There's drafts that didn't really go anywhere, and there's a short story. He didn't really write sequels, but this was the one book where he clearly felt there was more in the tank there. There's an awful lot more Wonka story that we have that we would like to tell. It's not like Dune: Part One where you go, 'This is what\u2019s happening in Part Two.' Hopefully it works exquisitely as a stand-alone movie. But I would definitely like to do more. And I'd like to spend more time in this world, and meet some more Oompa Loompas.\"[109]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Donnelly, Matt (November 14, 2023). \"Warner Bros.
