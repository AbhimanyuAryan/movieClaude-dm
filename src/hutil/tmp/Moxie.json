Tamara Chestna and Dylan Meyer adapted the screenplay from the 2017 novel of the same name by Jennifer Mathieu. It stars Hadley Robinson, Alycia Pascual-Pe\u00f1a, Lauren Tsai, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Nico Hiraga, and Poehler. The film focuses on 16-year-old Vivian (played by Hadley Robinson), who starts a feminist zine to empower the young women in her high school, as they contend with bullying, sexual harassment, and rape. The film was released on March 3, 2021, by Netflix and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nVivian is 16, lives with her mother Lisa, and attends Rockport High School. One day she joins her best friend Claudia at a class taught by Mr. Davies. Vivian notices classmate Seth, has gotten more attractive over the summer. He used to be called Seth \"The Shrimp\". Mr. Davies introduces new student Lucy, then begins a discussion of The Great Gatsby, a novel about a mysterious millionaire. She criticizes it as another tale of a rich white guy expressing sorrow over not having the woman he wants. The star jock Mitchell interrupts Lucy's opinion and defends the Jay Gatsby character.\nLater, Vivian sees Mitchell taking the soda Lucy was trying to buy, harassing her, and spitting in it. When Lucy reports Mitchell to Principal Shelly, she doesn't want to penalize Mitchell and tries to avoid getting involved.\nAt home, Vivian goes through Lisa's stuff and finds her old feminist zines and becomes inspired. The next day at school, the students discover a list labeling young women made by a group of jocks shared to everyone's phone. Many girls are embarrassed by it, in which the jocks express many sexist and perverse opinions, which makes them self-conscious. When Mitchell calls Lucy a foul word, Vivian becomes inspired by her feminist mother and starts \"Moxie\", a zine aimed at calling out the unfair treatment of girls at the school, and empowering them to raise their concerns.\nVivian befriends Lucy, as well as a group of other girls who have been put down, but Claudia is reluctant to get behind the movement and it causes a rift between them. Vivian also begins a relationship with Seth, who knows she started \"Moxie\" and supports her.\nAfter Mitchell wins an athletic scholarship over the girls' favorite candidate, Kiera, Vivian walks home feeling depressed, drinking a bottle of champagne along the way. She comes home to find Lisa with her boyfriend John, and is annoyed that her mother kept the relationship a secret from her. Vivian then throws up.\nLater, the \"Moxie\" girls respond to Mitchell winning the award by putting crude stickers all over the school. Principal Shelly, who was called out by \"Moxie\" for not supporting the girls, attempts to shut down the group. Claudia, who eventually joins the group, takes the fall for the stickers.\nVivian then hits a low point when Claudia criticizes her for not coming forward (she knew Vivian started \"Moxie\"), while also having a rough patch with Seth. She also faces challenges with her mother after she yells at Lisa and John during dinner.\nVivian finds a note from an anonymous girl who says she was raped the previous year. Vivian gets \"Moxie\" supporters to stage a walkout in support of the girl. The majority of students participate, and Vivian reveals that she started \"Moxie\".\nHead cheerleader Emma comes forward as the rape survivor, stating that Mitchell, her ex-boyfriend, was her rapist. It happened the previous year when they were dating, and they called her \"Most Bangable\", which left her mortified. All the students are horrified and lend their support. Principal Shelly overhears and plans to punish Mitchell at last.\nVivian reconciles with her mom, Claudia, and Seth, and \"Moxie\" gains more followers. Lisa expresses pride in her daughter and the girls throw a party in celebration of \"Moxie\".\n\nCast[edit]\n\nHadley Robinson as Vivian Carter\nAlycia Pascual-Pe\u00f1a as Lucy\nLauren Tsai as Claudia\nNico Hiraga as Seth Acosta\nPatrick Schwarzenegger as Mitchell Wilson\nAmy Poehler as Lisa Johnson\nSydney Park as Kiera\nAnjelika Washington as Amaya\nSabrina Haskett as Kaitlynn\nJosie Totah as CJ\nEmily Hopper as Meg\nMarcia Gay Harden as Principal Shelly\nIke Barinholtz as Mr. Davies\nJoshua Darnell Walker as Jay\nJosephine Langford as Emma\nClark Gregg as John\nHelen Slayton-Hughes as Helen\nCharlie Hall as Bradley\nDarrell M.

The website's critics consensus reads, \"Moxie comes up a little short on its titular ingredient when it comes to fully addressing its story's timely themes, but this sweet coming-of-age story is still easy to like.\"[9] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[10]\nRasha Jameel, writing in The Daily Star, accused the film of tokenism. Criticizing its \"careless\" insertion of the \"white savior\" trope, Jameel wrote, \"the film adds characters of colour and a white character with disability, but instead of allowing these characters to speak or act on their behalf, the narrative is told primarily through the all-too-common perspective of a privileged white American.\"[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Fleming, Mike Jr. (February 20, 2019). \"Amy Poehler To Direct 'Moxie' At Netflix; Riot Grrrl-Inspired Teen Starts Feminist Revolution At Her High School\".
