It is based on the novel of the same name by Evan Roskos.[1]\n\n\nCast[edit]\nLucas Jade Zumann as James Whitman\nTaylor Russell as Sophie\nJason Isaacs as Carl\nLisa Edelstein as Elly\nDavid Arquette as Xavier\nChase Stokes as Martin\nTom Wilkinson as the voice of Dr. Bird\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released on demand on January 12, 2021.[2][3]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film has an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on five reviews.[4]\nSandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media awarded the film three stars out of five and wrote, \"YA dramedy about anxiety has language, innuendo, drinking.\"[5]\nCath Clarke of The Guardian also awarded the film three stars out of five and wrote, \"The family dysfunction stuff is sensitively handled with some originality...\"[6]\nCyntia Vinney of Comic Book Resources gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"None of this would land, however, if it weren\u2019t for Zumann\u2019s earnest, heartfelt performance. He perfectly balances James' anxiety with his underlying sweetness as well as his awkward idiosyncrasy.\"[7]\nGlenn Kenny of The New York Times gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"The movie gets so drunk on its stylistic affectations (and unfunny attempts at cerebral comedy) that by the time it sobers up to take James's mental health seriously, it's too little, too late.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Amanda N'Duka (May 16, 2018). \"Lucas Jade Zumann, Taylor Russell, Lisa Edelstein & Jason Isaacs Topline 'Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets' Movie\".
