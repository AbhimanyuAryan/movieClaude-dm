The film stars Zach Galifianakis, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Snook, and Geraldine Viswanathan.\nThe Beanie Bubble was released in select cinemas on July 21, 2023, before its streaming release on July 28, 2023, by Apple TV+.[2]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film depicts the meteoric rise in popularity of the Beanie Babies and tells the story behind the toy obsession that took off in the 1990s. It follows toy manufacturer turned billionaire Ty Warner, and centers around the women who were integral to his success. Robbie, Sheila, and Maya help turn Beanie Babies into the coveted products they became. The women are based on three real women, Patricia Roche, Faith McGowan, and Lina Trivedi, each of whom played an integral role in the rising popularity of Beanie Babies.[3]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nZach Galifianakis as Ty Warner\nElizabeth Banks as Robbie\nSarah Snook as Sheila\nGeraldine Viswanathan as Maya\nTracey Bonner as Rose\nCarl Clemons-Hopkins as Jeremy\nHari Dhillon as Arjun Kumar\nAjay Friese as Deshad\nSweta Keswani as Neeti Kumar\nKurt Yaeger as Billy\nProduction[edit]\nIt was announced in January 2022 that Apple TV+ had acquired the distribution rights for the film, which would see Zach Galifinakis, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Snook, and Geraldine Viswanathan star, with Kristin Gore and Damian Kulash directing.[4]\nFilming began by April 2022 in Marietta, Georgia.[5] Production also took place in Atlanta.[6]\nThe film features a new original track from the band OK Go, titled \"This\".[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (July 2023)\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 48% of 98 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Beanie Bubble's cast makes the movie an easy watch, but that enjoyment is lessened by its shallow treatment of the real-life story.\"[8] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[9]\nThe New York Times critic Calum Marsh unfavorably compared The Beanie Bubble to other \"corporate biopics\" released in 2023, including Air and Tetris, and said that it \"deploys every storytelling clich\u00e9 in the book\".[10] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian criticised the film's \"deeply muddled non-storytelling and tonal blandness\",[11] and the Evening Standard's Charlotte O'Sullivan said its \"clich\u00e9d\" script offers \"a lazy take on power and greed\".[12] Digital Spy's Mireia Mullor called the film \"understuffed\" but said Geraldine Viswanathan's performance \"steals the show\".[13]\n\nSee also[edit]\nDark Side of the 90s - featuring an episode about the infamous \"Beanie bubble\"\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Beanie Bubble (15)\".
