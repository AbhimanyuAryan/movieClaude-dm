Cunningham, Marc Dworkin, and Eric Donald. It is a follow-up film to the comedy television series The Thundermans (2013\u201318), created by Spingarn. The film stars Kira Kosarin, Jack Griffo, Addison Riecke, Diego Velazquez, Maya Le Clark, Chris Tallman, and Rosa Blasi, reprising their roles as the Thunderman family, alongside other characters reprising their roles. Filming began in early April 2023 in Los Angeles. It was released on March 7, 2024 on Paramount+ and Nickelodeon.\nThe film could be a lead-in to a future revival series.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThree years after the events of the series finale, when meteors strike Metroburg, the Thundermans step in to save the citizens. After the save, the family want to have a fun night, but it is interrupted when another crime breaks out. When another team called the \"V-Team\" also arrive, Max ends up accidentally dropping a giant doughnut onto one of their members. Due to this, the Thundermans are fired from the T-Force and are sent back to Hiddenville. While Hank and Barb enjoy their return, and Billy and Nora look forward to a normal high school life, Max and Phoebe are determined to regain their superhero status.\nMeanwhile, Dark Mayhem, King Crab and Strongdor are in the Metroburg prison. The V-Team approaches them, revealing themselves to be their children. The children decide to devise their own plan, leaving their parents imprisoned. As the Thunder Twins are desperate to retrieve their jobs, they come up with the \"Tree Force\". However, the rest of the family prefers to live a normal life.\nMeanwhile, at Hiddenville High, Nora utilizes her laser eyes to obtain friends. When Billy couldn't make a friend alone, he uses the same idea. Nora, angered by this, tries to zap Billy, whilst Billy is blocking said attacks, but ends up accidentally zapping off Principal Bradford's ponytail.\nBack at home, Barb and Hank, still worried for Chloe's safety, call Cousin Blobbin requesting to borrow his helicopter to monitor Chloe without her noticing. Cherry launches two Splat Shakes that Hank had ordered from Splat Burger up to the helicopter. With Hank failing to catch them, they end up spilling and interfering with the helicopter's circuits. They are forced to make an emergency landing, crashing in front of Chloe and her friends.\nAfter that, Max and Phoebe figure out the V-Team are villains, they go by themselves to their lab to try to capture them, but the evil children see them and tie them, after that, the Thunder Twins are sent to a mysterious place called \"The Mayhem Cafe\", in which they get tortured by Dark Mayhem's pre-recorded voice guide. After escaping from the box, they get locked in with an upcoming self-destruct.\nMeanwhile, the children of the villains are trying to locate the Power Plant, which they find in the Thundermans' house. At first, Hank, who is the only one to know where the Power Plant is, refuses to give it to them, but then Dark Mayhem, Jr. shows him on his phone that Max and Phoebe are getting tortured, so Hank agrees to give the evil children the Power Plant if the Thunder Twins get released after. The children agree to this, and Hank gives them the Power Plant believing the twins would be released, but they lied. The evil children escape with the Power Plant and Max and Phoebe are still trapped in the mysterious place. And when all hopes are down in the Thundermans' house, Billy finds a blue part of the Power Plant that fell off the plant and can make superheroes. They end up feeding pieces of the blue part to citizens, such as Principal Bradford and Mrs. Wong, turning them into superheroes. After being turned into superheroes, they all work together to break the forcefield, and they succeed. Upon succeeding, Chloe teleports them to the location of Phoebe and Max. With Chloe's teleportation needing a recharge, right before the self-destruct, Hank punches the system, causing it to break and allowing them out.\nAfterwards, the Thundermans confront the villain's children, who are on the top of Mount Metroburg planning to release the red pieces of the power plant inside of a drone, having their parents view said plan. Whilst the family defeat the Villains, Dark Mayhem's son, Dark Mayhem Jr., releases the red pieces over Metroburg in a drone. Chloe volunteers to teleport someone onto to the drone to prevent them from affecting citizens. She teleports Max and Phoebe onto the drone and they remove the red pieces. With Phoebe being blinded by the wind, she gets blown onto the edge of the drone, about to fall. She tells the two to teleport back without her, but they refuse. Chloe reaches for her hand and they return to the rest of the family safely.\nLater, Super President Kickbutt comes back and reinstates the T-Force. The Thundermans agree, but on the condition that their Hiddenville home be their new headquarters. Super President Kickbutt agrees and welcomes the T-Force back to the Hero League.\nUnbeknownst to everyone, Dr. Colosso receives a mysterious message from an unknown being, promising a special assignment for him. Then the screen goes black as it says to be continued.\n\nCast[edit]\nMain article: List of The Thundermans characters\nKira Kosarin as Phoebe Thunderman[1]\nJack Griffo as Max Thunderman[1]\nAddison Riecke as Nora Thunderman[1]\nDiego Velazquez as Billy Thunderman[1]\nMaya Le Clark as Chloe Thunderman[1]\nChris Tallman as Hank Thunderman[1]\nRosa Blasi as Barb Thunderman[1]\nHarvey Guill\u00e9n as Cousin Blobbin\nDana Snyder as the voice of Dr. Colosso\nHelen Hong as Mrs. Wong\nTanner Stine as Oyster\nKenny Ridwan as Gideon\nAudrey Whitby as Cherry\nJake Borelli as Wolfgang\nDaniele Gaither as Super President Kickbutt\nJeff Meacham as Principal Bradford\nPaul F.
