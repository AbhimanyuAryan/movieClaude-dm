The film stars Toni Collette, Damian Lewis, Owen Teale, Joanna Page, Karl Johnson, Steffan Rhodri, Anthony O'Donnell, Nicholas Farrell, and Si\u00e2n Phillips, and follows the true story of Dream Alliance, a horse that raced in the Welsh Grand National. It had previously been the subject of the documentary, Dark Horse: The Incredible True Story of Dream Alliance.\nThe film tells the true story of Dream Alliance, an unlikely race horse bred by Welsh barmaid and cashier Jan Vokes. With very little money and no experience, she convinces her neighbours to chip in a bit each week to help raise Dream in the hopes he can compete with the racing elites. Dream rises through the ranks with grit and determination and goes on to race in the Welsh Grand National.\nDream Horse had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2020 and was released in the United States on 21 May 2021, by Bleecker Street and in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2021, by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nEmpty nesters Jan and Brian Vokes lead an uneventful, mundane life in Wales. She is a supermarket cashier and regularly helps her elderly parents while he stays home.\nAt her second job at the pub, Jan overhears Howard Davies telling stories about a winning horse he once owned. Curious, she finds a breeders guidebook through an ad in Horse and Hound and does her research. Telling Brian about her idea to breed a racehorse, he thinks she's mad. \nSoon the couple are buying Rewbell, once a racehorse but sold to them as a brood mare for \u00a3300. In the pub, Jan asks Howard for help choosing a stud, and he's not encouraging. She aims to form a syndicate of 20 locals contributing \u00a310 per week.\nPassing out flyers all over town, initially Jan's evening pitch meeting seems to be an epic fail, but they do get their 20-member syndicate formed. At the farm while awaiting the insemination, she tells Brian that she needs this project to motivate her.\nRewbell doesn't survive the birth, but her foal is born soundly. Their syndicate agrees to name the colt Dream Alliance. Once Howard deems him ready, the Vokes take him to trainer Phillip Hobbs, who finally takes him on for a trial period. Considered race-ready, Dream rises through the ranks with grit and determination. \nWhen he wins the King Edward's Challenge, another breeder offers to buy Dream, which Jan, Brian and Howard disregard. However, some of the others in the syndicate are angered at her quick refusal. Feeling inspired, Howard quits his accounting job which he hated and opens his own firm aimed at the not rich. Jan asks why and he explains he wanted to do better than his dad, who gave up trying to be a jockey, spending his life in a factory. \nA setback comes when Dream injures a tendon. Again, those in the syndicate focused on the bottom line are for putting him down, but Jan reminds them that he brought them hope and have given them pride. After hours of surgery, and days of rest and stem cell treatment Hobbs believes not only that the tendon is stronger than ever, but he could race in the upcoming Welsh Grand National.\nJan fears for Dream's well-being, but the rest of the syndicate overrules her. He wins the race, going on to continue racing for a decade before retiring. The Vokes have started a new syndicate and have a new project as of 2019.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nToni Collette as Jan Vokes\nDamian Lewis as Howard Davies\nOwen Teale as Brian Vokes\nJoanna Page as Angela Davies\nNicholas Farrell as Philip Hobbs\nSi\u00e2n Phillips as Maureen\nKarl Johnson as Kerby\nPeter Davison as Lord Avery\nSteffan Rhodri as Gerwyn\nAnthony O'Donnell as Maldwyn\nDi Botcher as Nerys\nAlex Jordan as Johnson White\nMax Hutchinson as James Lingsford\nLynda Baron as Elsie\nAsheq Akhtar as Peter\nDarren Evans as Goose\nKatherine Jenkins as herself\nClare Balding as herself\nProduction[edit]\nIt was announced in March 2019 that Euros Lyn was directing the film, with Toni Collette and Damian Lewis cast in the lead roles.[3] Owen Teale, Joanna Page, Nicholas Farrell, Si\u00e2n Phillips and Karl Johnson were added in May.[4]\nFilming began by May 2019 in Wales.[5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nDream Horse had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2020.[6] The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom on 17 April 2020, and in the United States on 1 May 2020,[7] but these were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[8][9] The film was eventually released to theaters on May 21, 2021 and was released on DVD, July 20, 2021.\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nDream Horse grossed $796,000 from 1,254 theaters in its opening weekend.
