Together, they plan to head toward its home-to-be.\n\nCast[edit]\nChristian Convery as Rob Horton[6]\nDennis Quaid as Beauchamp[6]\nQueen Latifah as Willie May[7]\nMadalen Mills as Sistine Bailey[6]\nKatharine McPhee as Caroline Horton[8]\nSam Trammell as Rob Horton Sr.[8]\nNicholas Ryan Hernandez as Billy Threemonger[6]\nJayden Fontaine as Norton Threemonger[6]\nAngela Giarratana as Miss Mills\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography occurred in Tifton, Georgia and Thomasville, Georgia in November 2019.[9][10]  Filming wrapped in December 2019.[2]\n\nControversy[edit]\nOn November 18, 2021, The Hollywood Reporter published an article about Ryan Donnell Smith, Allen Cheney, Emily Hunter Salveson and Ryan Winterstern not paying crew members before or after filming the movie.[2]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released in theaters on January 21, 2022 and on Demand and Digital February 8, 2022.[1]\n\nBox office[edit]\nIn South Africa, the film earned $16,541 from 59 theaters in its opening weekend.[11] In the United States and Canada, the film earned $364,216 from 872 theaters in its first weekend,[12] and $214,980 in its second.[13]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film has a 17% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10.[14] On Metacritic \u2014 which assigns a weighted mean score \u2014 the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[15]\nNick Schager of Variety gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"The fact that writer-director Ray Giarratana\u2019s film is based on Kate DiCamillo\u2019s children\u2019s book \u2014 and thus intended for young audiences \u2014 is hardly an excuse for such stodgy storytelling, which plays out with no mystery, ambiguity or subtlety.\"[16]\nNadir Samara of Screen Rant awarded the film one star out of five and wrote, \"The Tiger Rising is too serious & abstract for kids yet too ham-fisted for adults. Sadly, the tale has none of the imagination its protagonist does.\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Chowdhury, Samyarup (December 9, 2021). \"Trailer Reveal for The Tiger Rising, the Family Adventure Film Starring Queen Latifah\".
