Set in an English coastal town in the early 1980s, the film is about the power of human connection during turbulent times. It stars Olivia Colman, Micheal Ward, Monica Dolan, Tom Brooke, Tanya Moodie, Hannah Onslow, Crystal Clarke, Toby Jones, and Colin Firth.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 49th Telluride Film Festival on 3 September 2022, and was released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through a limited theatrical release in the United States on 9 December 2022 and theatrically in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2023. Empire of Light received praise for Colman and Ward's performances and Roger Deakins's cinematography, but its screenplay received criticism. At the 80th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama for Colman, while Ward received a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 76th British Academy Film Awards. It also received a nomination for Best Cinematography at the 95th Academy Awards.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1980, Hilary Small works as a duty manager at the \"Empire Cinema\", Margate, on the north coast of the English county of Kent. Hilary struggles with bipolar disorder, lives alone, has been prescribed lithium by her GP, and is having extramarital sex with her boss Donald Ellis.\nNew employee Stephen, who is Black British and lives with his mother Delia, a nurse, starts his new job at the cinema. Hilary is taken with the handsome and charming Stephen, and the two bond when she shows him the cinema's beautiful but disused upper floor.\nHilary becomes jealous when Stephen begins hanging out with Janine, a younger employee. While watching New Year's Eve fireworks from the cinema roof, Hilary impulsively kisses Stephen. The two of them begin a sexual relationship. Hilary cuts off Donald and, happy about the new relationship, stops taking her medication.\nHilary sees Stephen being harassed by a group of skinheads on the street and later deal with a racist customer and Stephen confides in her about the racism he faces. Hilary and Stephen go to the beach, where Stephen tells her about his first love, Ruby, who works at the same hospital as his mother. When Stephen asks about her past, she goes on an agitated rant about men and angrily destroys a sand castle they had been building.\nNeil, a colleague, discovers their relationship and warns Stephen of Hilary's mental health. He tells Hilary it would be best if they end their sexual affair. Donald informs the workers that the cinema has been chosen for the regional premiere of Chariots of Fire (1981). At the premiere, a manic Hilary gets on stage and delivers an agitated speech before informing Donald's wife about their affair. Hilary's mental health deteriorates. While Stephen is at her flat checking on her, mental-health authorities break down her door and take her to be re-institutionalised. (He watches while hiding in the next room.) \nWeeks later, back at the theatre, Donald has been replaced and Stephen begins training with Norman, the cinema's projectionist. He runs into Ruby at the cinema, and they start dating again. Hilary is released from the hospital and returns to work. Stephen advises her to see a movie at the cinema, something she has never done. During her welcome-back party, a skinhead crowd marches past the theatre. When they see Stephen, they break in and assault him. Hilary accompanies him to the hospital, where she meets Stephen's mother.\nAs Stephen recuperates, Hilary initially stays away. Norman confides in her that he has a son he has not seen in many years because he abandoned his family and cautions her not to run away. She visits Stephen in the hospital. His mother tells Hilary that she makes Stephen happy. An overjoyed Hilary rushes back to the theatre and has Norman play a movie for her: Being There (1979).\nStephen returns to the cinema but informs Hilary that, following her advice, he has decided to return to college and will be leaving town. Stephen remembers his times with Hilary at a going-away dinner with Ruby and his mother. The two meet in a park, where Hilary gives him a book and finally bids him goodbye.\nAs Stephen leaves on the train, he reads from the book: High Windows by Philip Larkin.\n\nCast[edit]\nOlivia Colman as Hilary Small\nMicheal Ward as Stephen Murray\nColin Firth as Donald Ellis\nToby Jones as Norman\nTom Brooke as Neil\nTanya Moodie as Delia Murray\nHannah Onslow as Janine\nCrystal Clarke as Ruby\nMonica Dolan as Rosemary Bates\nSara Stewart as Brenda Ellis\nRon Cook as Mr Cooper\nJustin Edwards as Jim Booth\nJamie Whitelaw as Sean\nProduction[edit]\nThe Dreamland Margate Cinema signage was changed to \"Empire Cinema\" during production of the film.\nIt was announced in April 2021 that Sam Mendes had set his next film, which he would write and direct himself at Searchlight Pictures. Olivia Colman was in talks to star and Roger Deakins was announced as cinematographer.[5] Colman was confirmed in July, with Micheal Ward also joining the cast.[6] In December, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Crystal Clarke and Tanya Moodie were added to the cast.[7] Tom Brooke and Hannah Onslow were confirmed to star in late February.[8] Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the film's score.[9]\nFilming began on 7 February 2022 at Margate on the Isle of Thanet in Kent.[10][11][12] The Dreamland Margate Cinema building was remodelled and renamed until 15 May 2022.[13]\nThe film includes several pieces of music that are being played on a record player in the film, such as Bob Dylan's \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\", Cat Stevens's \"Morning Has Broken\" and Joni Mitchell's \"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio\".[14]\n\nRelease[edit]\nEmpire of Light premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on 3 September 2022.[15] It received a limited theatrical release by Searchlight Pictures in the United States on 9 December 2022 and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2023.[16][17]\nThe film was released for VOD on 7 February 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on 21 February 2023.[18][19][20]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nThe performance of Olivia Colman received critical acclaim.\nThe film has received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45%, based on 242 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Empire of Light contains some fine performances and a few flashes of brilliance, but this tribute to the magic of cinema is disappointingly mundane.\"[21] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[22] A more favourable review in The Guardian said the film was a \"poignant, wonderfully acted drama\".[14]\nMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, rating the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, wrote that it \"starts out a bit dim and unfocused and becomes sharper and more illuminating as it unreels.\" He also praised Roger Deakins' cinematography and Olivia Colman's performance, but was more critical of the character of Stephen: \"[H]e remains an abstraction for too long, to the point where it looks like the film is setting him up as more of a plot device (or sacrificial lamb) than a man. The movie trembles with intimations of impending doom for Stephen, and the dialogue mentions then-recent racial incidents. But [Sam] Mendes presents his anger, fear and distress with the same dissociated stare that freezes Hilary in her tracks when she sees skinheads tormenting Stephen on a sidewalk.\"[23]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAARP Movies for Grownups Awards\n\n28 January 2023\n\nBest Grownup Love Story\n\nEmpire of Light\n\nNominated\n\n[24]\n\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n12 March 2023\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nRoger Deakins\n\nNominated\n\n[25]\n\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists\n\n5 January 2023\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nNominated\n\n[26]\n\n\nAmerican Society of Cinematographers\n\n5 March 2023\n\nFeature Film\n\nNominated\n\n[27]\n\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\n6 February 2023\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor\n\nMicheal Ward\n\nNominated\n\n[28]\n\n\nOutstanding Breakthrough Actor\n\nNominated\n\n\nBritish Academy Film Awards\n\n19 February 2023\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nNominated\n\n[29]\n\n\nOutstanding British Film\n\nSam Mendes and Pippa Harris\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nRoger Deakins\n\nNominated\n\n\nCritics' Choice Awards\n\n15 January 2023\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nNominated\n\n[30]\n\n\nFlorida Film Critics Circle\n\n22 December 2022\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nNominated\n\n[31]\n\n\nBest Score\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross\n\nRunner-up\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\n10 January 2023\n\nBest Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama\n\nOlivia Colman\n\nNominated\n\n[32]\n\n\nGolden Reel Awards\n\n26 February 2023\n\nOutstanding Achievement in Sound Editing \u2013 Feature Dialogue / ADR\n\nOliver Tarney and Rachael Tate\n\nNominated\n\n[33]\n\n\nGuild of Music Supervisors Awards\n\n5 March 2023\n\nBest Music Supervision in a Trailer \u2013 Film\n\nMatthew Bailey and Shawn Stevens (\"Home\")\n\nNominated\n\n[34]\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\n16 November 2022\n\nBest Original Score \u2013 Feature Film\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nHouston Film Critics Society\n\n18 February 2023\n\nBest Original Score\n\nNominated\n\n[36]\n\n\nLas Vegas Film Critics Society\n\n12 December 2022\n\nBest Actress\n\nOlivia Colman\n\nNominated\n\n[37]\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nRoger Deakins\n\nNominated\n\n\nLondon Film Critics' Circle\n\n5 February 2023\n\nBritish Actress of the Year\n\nOlivia Colman[a]\n\nNominated\n\n[38]\n\n\nSatellite Awards\n\n3 March 2023\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nRoger Deakins\n\nNominated\n\n[39]\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nAlexandra Byrne\n\nNominated\n\n\nToronto International Film Festival\n\n 8\u201318 September 2022\n\nTIFF Ebert Director Award\n\nSam Mendes\n\nWon\n\n[40]\n\n\nWashington D.C.
