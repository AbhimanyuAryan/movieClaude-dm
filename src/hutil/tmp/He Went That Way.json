The film was produced by Head Gear Films, Teashop Productions, and Mister Smith Entertainment. It was the directorial debut of Jeffrey Darling, who died in a surfing accident in North Palm Beach in Sydney, Australia on March 27, 2022.[4][5][6] It is based on a screenplay by Evan M. Wiener.[7] According to executive producer Phil Hunt, the production was able to cast Quinto by going through a friend of the actor instead of his agent.[8] Filming took place on location in Los Angeles, California.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the Tribeca Festival on June 9, 2023.[10] In October 2023, Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film.[11] It was released in a limited release on January 5, 2024, prior to video on demand on January 12, 2024.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 26% of 31 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10.[13]\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"it plays like a tonally uncertain blend of desert neo-noir, prickly buddy movie, misfit character study and crime thriller, with zero psychological grounding and even less suspense\".[14] Christian Zilko of IndieWire called the film \"a competent but emotionally thin story\", and gave it a grade of B\u2212.[15]\nPatrice Witherspoon of Screen Rant described the film as \"a dumpster fire from start to finish\", criticizing the plot, tonal shifts, and performances, except for Quinto's performance, which she praised as the film's highlights.[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"He Went That Way (15)\".
