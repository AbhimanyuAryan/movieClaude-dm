It serves as a direct sequel to Smile (2022), which in turn is based on Finn's short film Laura Hasn't Slept (2020). Kyle Gallner reprises his role from the first film, while Naomi Scott, Lukas Gage, and Rosemarie DeWitt appear as new characters. Pre-production began by April 2023 with filming lasting from January to March in 2024. \nThe film is scheduled for release by Paramount Pictures on October 18, 2024.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nKyle Gallner as Joel\nNaomi Scott\nLukas Gage\nRosemarie DeWitt\nDylan Gelula\nRa\u00fal Castillo\nMiles Gutierrez-Riley\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment and casting[edit]\nFollowing the release of Smile (2022), during interviews between November and December 2022, writer and director Parker Finn stated that he had intentionally left portions of the first film ambiguous, with various plotlines unresolved, while expressing interest in exploring those details in a potential sequel.[1] He stated that while additional installments may explore the backstory of the entity, he would like to keep its mysterious nature intact.[2] He noted that a follow-up film would be notably different from the first, stating that he believed \"there is still a lot of interesting stuff to explore in the world of Smile. ...\u00a0I'd want to make sure that there's a new, exciting, fresh way into it that the audience isn't anticipating. I also want to find some new ways to scare them and unnerve them.\"[1][2][3]\nIn March 2023, Finn signed a first-look deal with Paramount Pictures to develop additional horror projects.[4] The following month at 2023 CinemaCon, Paramount announced that a sequel to Smile was green-lit and entered pre-production, with Finn returning as writer and director.[5] In December 2023, Naomi Scott was cast in a leading role.[6] In early 2024, Lukas Gage, Rosemarie DeWitt, Dylan Gelula, Ra\u00fal Castillo and Miles Gutierrez-Riley joined the cast.[7][8][9] Kyle Gallner reprised his role as Joel from the first film.[10]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography took place from January to March 2024 throughout Hudson Valley, New York, with primary locations in Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, Wappingers Falls, Albany and New York City.[11][12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film is scheduled to be released by Paramount Pictures on October 18, 2024.[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Davids, Brian (December 9, 2022). \"How Parker Finn's 'Smile' Went From Streaming to Theatrical in a Single Night\".
