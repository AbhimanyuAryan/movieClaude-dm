Starring Riley Keough, Jesse Eisenberg, Christophe Zajac-Denek, and Nathan Zellner. The film follows a family of Sasquatch over a period of one year. Ari Aster served as an executive producer under his Square Peg banner.\nIt had its world premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024. The film was released by Bleecker Street on April 12, 2024.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nJesse Eisenberg\nRiley Keough\nChristophe Zajac-Denek\nNathan Zellner\nProduction[edit]\nIn August 2022, Jesse Eisenberg announced his involvement in the film as an actor and producer, with David Zellner and Nathan Zellner directing. He stated to Entertainment Weekly, \"In full makeup. In full body hair. No lines, I grunt, but no lines, and I'm so looking forward to this.\"[4] Principal photography took place in Northern California in 2022.[5]\nTo help the cast prepare for their roles, Eisenberg brought in movement coach and mime coach Lorin Eric Salm, whom Eisenberg had trained with to play French mime artist Marcel Marceau in the feature film Resistance. Prior to filming, in what was dubbed \"Sasquatch School\"  or \"Ape Camp\", Salm worked with the actors to explore Sasquatch behavior and to establish consistent movement for the creatures so that they would all appear to be of the same species. Drawing inspiration both from primates and from Bigfoot lore, he helped them find a balance between human and ape-like movement. The work included creating a walk, learning animal behavior, developing non-verbal emotional expression, and exploring how a Sasquatch might interact with unfamiliar objects. The movement sessions also focused on nuances of daily Sasquatch life and their manner of eating, and it was during this training period when their vocalizations and forms of communication were chosen.[6][7][8][9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nSasquatch Sunset had its world premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024.[10]\nPrior to this Bleecker Street acquired distribution rights to the film.[5] It also screened at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival on February 19, 2024, as part of the Berlinale Special section,[11][12] and South by Southwest on March 11, 2024.[13][14] It was released in limited theaters in the United States on April 12, 2024, before going wide a week later.[1]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of 98 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"For audiences attuned to the Zellners' utterly unique wavelength, Sasquatch Sunset offers a moving\u2014if often inscrutable\u2014look at our relationship with the natural world.\"[15] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[16]\nTim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave the film a rating of two out of five, writing \"It's just too carried away with being a big prank: even something as outr\u00e9 as Harmony Korine's Trash Humpers (2010) seemed less desperate to draw a crowd.\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Thompson, Jaden (February 13, 2024). \"Sasquatch Sunset Trailer: Jesse Eisenberg and Riley Keough Become Hairy, Horny Beasts in Absurdist Comedy\".
