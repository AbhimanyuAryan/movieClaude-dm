Set in the Land of Luck, the story follows the unluckiest person, Sam Greenfield (Noblezada), as she must unite with a talking black cat named Bob (Pegg) to turn her luck around.\nThe project was announced in July 2017, shortly after Skydance Animation was formed in March 2017, with Paramount Pictures distributing as the schedule for March 2021. Luck was subsequently green-lighted by Paramount Animation chief Mireille Soria in April 2018, with Alessandro Carloni signing on to direct the film, from a script by Aibel and Berger. The film underwent many changes during production, such as rewrites, directors, and release dates, and Holmes was later announced as the new director in January 2020, replacing Carloni. Much of the main voice cast, including Noblezada and Pegg, signed on in January 2022, following the casting of Fonda and Goldberg in February and June 2021, respectively. Production was done remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLuck premiered in Madrid on August 2, 2022, and was released on Apple TV+ and in select theaters in the United States on August 5.[4] The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the voice acting, music, and animation, but criticism for the worldbuilding and plot.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nSam Greenfield is a clumsy, orphaned young woman whose life has been constantly plagued by misfortune and has recently been forced out from her foster home, much to the dismay of her younger friend Hazel, who is hoping to be adopted soon. One night, after sharing a panini with a black cat, she finds a penny she hopes to give to Hazel for her collection of other lucky items to help her get adopted. The next day, Sam notices that the penny has made her luck significantly improve. However, she soon loses the penny by inadvertently flushing it down a toilet.\nAs Sam bemoans her error, she encounters the cat again and tells him what happened, which causes the cat to berate her for losing the penny. Shocked, Sam follows the cat through a portal to the Land of Luck, where creatures like leprechauns create good luck for the people on Earth. The cat, named Bob, tells Sam he needs the penny for traveling purposes and that he will be banished if word gets out that he lost it. Bob and Sam make a deal to get another penny from the Penny depot for Hazel to use before returning it to Bob. Bob uses a button from Sam to pass off as a penny while she sneaks into the Land of Luck using clothes belonging to Bob's personal leprechaun, Gerry. Throughout the journey, Sam comes to learn how the good luck is managed by a dragon, and that bad luck is managed underneath the Land of Luck.\nFollowing a disaster at the Penny depot which causes Gerry to learn about Sam's identity, Gerry uses a drone to retrieve the missing penny on Earth but the drone gets lost in the In-Between, a space between the Good and Bad Luck lands. Sam and Bob go to the In-Between, which is managed by a unicorn named Jeff. Jeff manages a machine called the Bad Luck Apparat that keeps bad luck specks from sticking which feeds the Randomizer, another machine that sends both good and bad luck into Earth. Jeff tells the pair he found the penny and has returned it to the depot. Not deterred, Sam decides to visit the dragon in hopes to get another penny. The dragon, named Babe, shares a moment with Sam by telling her how better things would be if everyone had good luck before giving her a new penny. But Sam sacrifices her penny after Bob is caught for faking his travel penny to spare him from banishment.\nStill wanting to help Hazel, Sam and Bob decide to temporarily shut down the Bad Luck Apparat to prevent bad luck from going to the Randomizer and give Hazel the luck she needs to get adopted. However, the bad luck specks start to clog Jeff's machines and destroy the good luck and bad luck stones within the Randomizer, which itself brings bad luck to the Land of Luck and Earth. Seeing Hazel did not get adopted because of this, learning that Bob is actually an unlucky English cat and having been found out as a human, Sam sulks in remorse. Bob apologizes and tells Sam that Hazel is the luckiest girl for having Sam at her side. Sam realizes things can be fixed because she remembers seeing some good luck in Bad Luck land while on her way to the In-Between.\nBack in Bad Luck, they find it in a tiki bar where the bartender, a root monster named Rootie, who is Bob's old friend, gives them a jar of good luck they have been using. They take it to Babe to forge new good and bad luck stones. However, while Babe creates a bad luck stone, she creates two good luck stones, wanting to create a world with only good luck. Before she can place them, Sam tells Babe people need bad luck as much as good luck. Realizing her mistake, she allows Sam to place the bad luck stone, and  good luck is restored to normal, where Sam sees Hazel finally getting adopted by a new family. Bob is offered to keep his job at the Land of Luck, but decides he wants to live with Sam.\nOne year later back on Earth, Hazel's family spends time with Sam and Bob as they have finally accepted their bad luck.\n\nVoice cast[edit]\nEva Noblezada as Sam Greenfield, an unlucky human who discovers the Land of Luck and must unite with magical creatures there to turn her luck around[5]\nSimon Pegg as Bob, an unlucky anthropomorphic, short haired black cat with a Scottish accent who becomes Sam's partner for the journey[5]\nJane Fonda as Babe, a female dragon who acts as the exuberant CEO of Good Luck and undisputed luckiest ancient being in all the land[6]\nWhoopi Goldberg as The Captain, a leprechaun who acts as the Land of Luck's head of security[7]\nFlula Borg as Jeff, a German-accented unicorn who works as the facilities engineer maintaining the luck distributing machine[5]\nLil Rel Howery as Marvin, Sam's upbeat boss who runs an arts and crafts shop[5]\nColin O'Donoghue as Gerry, a leprechaun who works with Bob[5]\nJohn Ratzenberger as Rootie, a root monster who runs a tiki bar and the self-appointed Mayor of Bad Luck[5]\nGrey DeLisle as Mrs. Rivera, Saoirse, the Penny Depot boss and additional voices\nSuzy Nakamura as a social worker\nKwaku Fortune as Gael\nAdelynn Spoon as Hazel, Sam's best friend and roommate at the Summerland Home For Girls[5]\nKari Wahlgren as Hazel's adoptive mother and Aine\nNick Thurston as Hazel's adoptive father\nThurston also voices a nosy cat\nChris Edgerly as a typing Bunny\nMoe Irvin as Phil the Pig Foreman\nFred Tatasciore as Quinn, Fred and additional voices\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn March 2017, Skydance Media formed a multi-year partnership with Madrid-based animation studio Ilion Animation Studios, forming an animation division called Skydance Animation.[8] In July, it announced Luck.[9] It would be distributed by Paramount Pictures as part of their deal with Skydance Media and was given a release date of March 19, 2021.[10] In April 2018, Luck was greenlit by then-Paramount Animation chief Mireille Soria,[11] and Alessandro Carloni signed on to direct the film, from a script by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger based on an original concept by Rebeca Carrasco, Juan De Dios and Juli\u00e1n Romero.[12][13] Luck had been in development at Ilion before forming its deal with Skydance. Skydance Animation hired former Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios CCO John Lasseter in late January 2019, as Head of Animation.[14][15]\nFollowing Lasseter's hiring, Soria announced that Paramount Animation would no longer work with Skydance Animation.[16] Luck was still going to be released by Paramount Pictures without Paramount Animation[17] until Apple TV+ acquired the distribution rights to it in December 2020.[18] Apple Original Films would replace Paramount as a production company.[19] On January 14, 2020, Carloni was replaced by Peggy Holmes, who had previously directed Secret of the Wings (2012) and The Pirate Fairy (2014) for Lasseter, as the film's director.[20] Kiel Murray, screenwriter for Cars (2006) and Cars 3 (2017), was also hired to rewrite the screenplay, turning it into a workplace fantasy comedy similar to Monsters, Inc. through Aibel and Berger were still credited for the story co-written by Murray.[21][6]\nOne of the core inspirations when researching the myths about luck is the main character Sam, having her in foster care to find her forever family.[22] The main inspiration for Sam and her unluckyness came from television shows such as I Love Lucy and The Carol Burnett Show, along with other inspiration from Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Donald O'Connor. In researching luck, workers at Skydance Animation discovered how obsessed people are with the concept, along with some interesting reversals, including how it became random by good and bad luck. For example, black cats are considered good luck in Scotland, which led them to create Bob. By the end of the film, he is revealed to be English as black cats are considered bad luck in England. The land of Luck was designed by production designer Fred Warner to explain both sides being put of a coin.[23]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn April 2019, Emma Thompson was hired to voice a character in the film, but left the project after Lasseter was hired.[24] In February 2021, Jane Fonda was cast as The Dragon,[6] and in June, Whoopi Goldberg was cast as The Captain.[7] Other cast members were announced in January 2022, including Eva Noblezada, Simon Pegg, Flula Borg, Lil Rel Howery, Colin O'Donoghue, John Ratzenberger and Adelynn Spoon.[5]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nAnimation was provided by Skydance Animation Madrid (formerly Ilion Animation Studios) and was also made in Los Angeles and Connecticut. Portions of production were done remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.[25]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Luck (soundtrack)\nTanya Donelly and Mt. Joy were originally attached to compose the score for the film, while William J. Caparella served as lead editor.[26][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] However, on November 15, 2021, it was announced that composer John Debney replaced them as composer.[27] Noblezada did a cover of \"Lucky Star\" with additional vocals by Alana Da Fonseca, for the film's soundtrack by Milan Records.[citation needed]\n\nRelease[edit]\nLuck was released to Apple TV+ and in select theaters in the United States on August 5, 2022.[5][28] The film was originally set to be released in theaters on March 19, 2021 by Paramount Pictures, but was delayed to February 18, 2022.[10][17][29] On May 8, 2020, Skydance Animation president Holly Edwards revealed that the rough cut would have test screenings late in the summer of 2020.[25]  On December 16, 2020, Apple TV+ secured the distribution rights to the film, with it retaining the February date, before getting delayed to its current release date.[30][31][5]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 48% of 96 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Luck is inoffensive enough as an animated babysitter, but there are far more original\u2014and entertaining\u2014options for its target audience.\"[32] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[33]\nPeter Bradshaw from The Guardian rated the film two stars out of five, describing the script as \"utterly zingless and contorted\" and writing, \"Everything about this robotically made movie looks derivative and contrived; the videogame aesthetic is dull and the quirky high concept plays like a pound-shop knockoff of Inside Out and Soul.\"[34] John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"The bigger problem is there are too many ideas, and fantastical solutions to manufactured problems, most of which feel as if they're being made up as the movie goes along.\"[35] IndieWire's David Ehrlich gave it a D+ grade, calling it \"is a terrible idea for a movie, executed poorly, and by someone who used to know better. The best thing I can say about the finished product is that, unlike most forms of bad luck, this one is wonderfully easy to avoid altogether.\"[36]\nThe Sydney Morning Herald's Paul Byrnes gave the film 3/5 stars, writing, \"It has lively physical humour and appealing characters. The Scottish cat is a laugh, and the overall voice cast is distinguished, with Jane Fonda and Whoopi Goldberg in significant roles... But at 106 minutes, it's at least 15 minutes too long, with a complicated story that should have been smoothed out in development.\"[37] The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin gave it 4/5 stars, calling it \"a funny, imaginative, beautifully rendered coming-of-age parable, with strong overtones of Monsters, Inc. and Inside Out.\"[38]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of Ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\nNovember 16, 2022\n\nOriginal Score \u2014 Animated Film (Luck)\n\nJohn Debney\n\nNominated\n\n[39]\n\n\nAnnie Awards\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nOutstanding Achievement for Character Design in an Animated Feature Production\n\nMassimiliano Narciso\n\nNominated\n\n[40]\n\nShort film[edit]\nOn March 17, 2023, in celebration of St. Patrick's Day, Apple TV+ released a short film titled Bad Luck Spot!, directed by Matt Youngberg.
