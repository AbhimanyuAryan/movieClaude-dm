It also stated that People in the Park Productions is credited in post-production.[12]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released as an NFT via CurrencyWorks Inc.'s platform Vuele.[13]\nIn January 2022, it was announced that Lions Gate Entertainment had acquired distribution rights via its subsidiary Grindstone Entertainment, with a scheduled release date in May 2022.[14] Zero Contact was released on May 27, 2022.[4]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe first trailer was released online, in September 2021. It notably announced many of the production details on-screen.[12] In May 2021, following Lionsgate's purchase of distribution rights, a new poster and trailer was released alongside the official announcement of the movie's official release date.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film has a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews.[15]\nRich Cross of Starburst gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"High-concept techno-thriller Zero Contact is the latest mainstream movie determined to make a virtue out of the necessity of the Covid lockdown.\"[16] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"Let\u2019s just say that 'The machine runs on dark matter reactor' is one of the script\u2019s more coherent lines.\"[17] Dennis Harvey of Variety gave the film a negative review, calling it \"a steaming pile of nada.\"[18]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn January 2022, it was announced that two sequels will be filmed back-to-back. Anthony Hopkins will reprise his role from the first movie, which was filmed remotely via Zoom. Director Rick Dugdale revealed that principal photography had already commenced, with the projects in various degrees of production. The collaborative development with Lionsgate is noted as being the first feature film to be produced on-location in Antarctica. The production crew worked alongside Sebastian Copeland and David Hatcher Childress to ensure safety in the extreme conditions of the frozen Tundra continent. The production will also take place in 14 other geographical locations.[14][19]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Stephanie Prange (July 7, 2021). \"Anthony Hopkins Film 'Zero Contact' to Be Released as NFT on Vuele Platform\".
