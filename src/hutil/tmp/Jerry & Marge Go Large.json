Based on Jason Fagone's 2018 HuffPost article of the same name,[2] the film, which is based on a true story,[3] stars Bryan Cranston and Annette Bening.\nThe film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 15, 2022, and was released on Paramount+ on June 17, 2022.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material. (September 2023)\nIn the small town of Evart, Michigan, Jerry and Marge Selbee live a quiet life. Jerry, recently retired after forty-two years, spends his days tinkering with his new motorboat. But an accidental crash at the lake turns his attention elsewhere.\nOne day, while at the local gas station, Jerry overhears a conversation about the WinFall lottery's rolldown weeks. A mathematician at heart, he quickly figures out a statistical loophole. He realizes that during rolldowns, buying a large number of tickets almost guarantees a win. Marge, bored in retirement immediately grabs a hold and says \"I'm in,\" when she learns of the lottery winnings. \nThey start small, but Marge's encouragement leads Jerry to go all in. They empty their savings, and the risk pays off - their $8,000 investment turns into $15,000. Excited by their success, they can't keep it a secret for long.\nWhen WinFall closes in Michigan, the Selbees don't give up. Marge organizes a 10-hour road trip to Massachusetts, where the lottery is still active. They spend days at a small liquor store, printing ticket after ticket, doubling their money once again.\nBack in Evart, they decide to share their secret. They create GS Investment Strategies, allowing their friends and neighbors to invest. The investment reinvigorates the town. Old businesses reopen, and the local Jazz Fest venue is restored, all thanks to the lottery winnings.\nBut their success attracts unwanted attention. A group of Harvard students, led by Tyler, have also discovered the loophole. They confront Jerry and Marge, arrogantly suggesting they combine forces. The Selbees refuse, standing firm in their methods and morals.\nAs tensions rise, Tyler threatens Jerry, demanding he stop playing WinFall. Jerry almost gives in, but the support of his son and the community strengthens his resolve. They won't be bullied out of their endeavor.\nThe story reaches its peak when Jerry confronts Tyler in Massachusetts, exposing his selfish tactics. In a final twist, the Massachusetts State Lottery, pressured by growing media attention, shuts down WinFall.\nDespite the end of their lottery journey, Jerry and Marge return to Evart as heroes. Their adventure not only brought wealth but also revived the spirit of their small town.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBryan Cranston as Jerry Selbee\nAnnette Bening as Marge Selbee\nRainn Wilson as Bill\nLarry Wilmore as Steve\nMichael McKean as Howard\nAnn Harada as Shirley\nJake McDorman as Doug Selbee\nAnna Camp as Dawn Selbee\nDevyn McDowell as Liz\nUly Schlesinger as Tyler Langford\nCheech Manohar as Eric\nTracie Thoms as Maya\nLindsay Rootare as Mindy\nTori Kelly as herself\nProduction[edit]\nIn April 2018, it was reported that Levantine Films and Netter Films would produce a film adaptation of Jason Fagone's HuffPost article \"Jerry and Marge Go Large\", with Brad Copeland writing the screenplay.[4] In June 2021, it was announced that Paramount+ had greenlit the film, set to be directed by David Frankel and star Bryan Cranston and Annette Bening.[5]\nFilming began in July 2021 in Georgia, with Rainn Wilson, Larry Wilmore and Jake McDorman joining the cast.[6][7] In August 2021, Uly Schlesinger, Michael McKean, Anna Camp, Ann Harada, and Devyn McDowell joined the cast.[8]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 15, 2022.[1][9] It was released on Paramount+ on June 17, 2022.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 68% of 56 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10.
