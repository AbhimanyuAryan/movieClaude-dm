Quiver Distribution and Mongrel Media released it in the United States and Canada on February 5, 2021.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nJohn lives with his husband Eric in California, far from the traditional rural life he left behind years ago. His father, Willis, a headstrong man from a bygone era, lives alone on the isolated farm where John grew up. Willis's mind is declining, so John brings him west, hoping he and his sister, Sarah, can help their father find a home closer to them. Their best intentions ultimately run up against Willis's angry refusal to change his way of life in any way.\n\nCast[edit]\nLance Henriksen as Willis (75 years)\nViggo Mortensen as John\nTerry Chen as Eric\nSverrir Gu\u00f0nason as Willis (23\u201343 years)\nWilliam Healy as John (16 years)\nHannah Gross as Gwen\nLaura Linney as Sarah\nCanadian actor-directors David Cronenberg and Paul Gross have cameos as Willis' proctologists.\n\nProduction[edit]\nIn October 2018, it was announced Viggo Mortensen would star in the film, alongside Lance Henriksen, Sverrir Gu\u00f0nason, and directing from a screenplay he wrote. Mortensen and Daniel Bekerman will serve as producers on the film under their Scythia Films banner.[5] In March 2019, Laura Linney, Hannah Gross and Terry Chen joined the cast of the film.[6]\nMortensen had not originally intended to play the lead role in the film himself, but found that since there were virtually no other major stars in the cast, committing to act in the film was the only way he was able to secure production funding.[3]\nThough not an autobiographical piece, Mortensen was influenced by feelings from his upbringing.[7] One of the first scenes of the movie where Mortensen's character shoots a duck as a young boy and decides to keep the dead bird as a pet actually happened to him as a child.[8]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in March 2019.[9] Filming took place in Los Angeles and Northern Ontario.\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 31, 2020.[10] It screened at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival in September.[11] It was released in the United Kingdom on December 4, 2020, by Modern Films.[12][13] In December 2020, Quiver Distribution acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film and set it for a February 5, 2021, release.[14] It was released in Canada on February 5, 2021.[15]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film has a rating of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 96 reviews and an average of 6.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"As messy and complex as the relationship at its center, Falling's repetitive nature can be taxing, but its heart is clearly in the right place.\"[16] Metacritic reports a score of 66 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[17]\nIt won the 2020 Sebastiane Award and the award for Outstanding Achievement in Picture Editing from the Directors Guild of Canada,[citation needed] and received five Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, for Best Actor (Henriksen), Best Art Direction or Production Design (Carol Spier), Best Costume Design (Anne Dixon), Best Editing (Ronald Sanders) and Best Casting (Deirdre Bowen).[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Alan Orange, \"Viggo Mortensen Unites with Buckethead & Skating Polly for His Falling Soundtrack\".
