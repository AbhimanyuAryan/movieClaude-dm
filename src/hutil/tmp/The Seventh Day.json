Lange.

They try to stop the demonic possession of a young boy named Charlie.\nWhile performing the exorcism on Charlie and seeing his arms slowly burn, Father Daniel realizes that Father Peter is actually possessed, and in a struggle, Father Daniel kills Father Peter.\nLater on, the archbishop and Father Daniel realize every priest who has worked under Father Peter has been possessed by a demon, creating a network of demonic priests that is quite sizable.\n\nCast[edit]\nGuy Pearce as Father Peter Costello\nChris Galust as young Peter Costello\nVadhir Derbez as Father Daniel Garcia\nStephen Lang as Archbishop\nKeith David as Father Louis\nRobin Bartlett as Helen\nBrady Jenness as Charlie Giroux\nTristan Riggs as Nicholas Miller\nHannah Alline Culwell as Mrs. Miller\nHeath Freeman as Mr. Miller\nAcory\u00e9 White as George\nProduction[edit]\nOn November 6, 2019, it was announced that Guy Pearce signed on to play the lead role in the film.[2] On January 14, 2020, Vadhir Derbez joined the cast.[3] On January 27, 2020, Stephen Lang, Keith David, Robin Bartlett, Brady Jenness and Chris Galust joined the cast of the film.[4]\nPrincipal photography began on February 5, 2020 in Dallas and New Orleans.[5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt was released on March 26, 2021, by Vertical Entertainment and Redbox Entertainment.[6]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14%, based on reviews from 14 critics, with an average score of 4.10/10.[7] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[8]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"The movie is diverting enough when it flirts with clerical politics, and that made me think it might be cool to make an exorcist film that dramatized the true-life ins and outs of the Catholic Church\u2019s relationship to exorcism. There\u2019s a major story there, and it could fuel a heady thriller. But The Seventh Day, having established Father Peter as a new kind of exorcist renegade, soon gets down to business as usual.\"[9]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"The Seventh Day (2021)\".
