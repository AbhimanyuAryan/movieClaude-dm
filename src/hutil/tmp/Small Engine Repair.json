Production began in February 2019 outside of New York City, namely in Yonkers and Tappan, New York.[3][4] Although, some establishing shots were taken in Manchester, New Hampshire, the city where the film takes place.\nThe film was penned and directed by John Pollono and produced by Peter Abrams, Jon Bernthal, Rick Rosenthal, and Noah Rothman.[5] Pollono and Bernthal reprise their roles from the original production and Shea Whigham and Spencer House portray Packie and Chad, respectively. Michael Redfield and Josh Helman, who both starred in the original production, are in the film as new characters. Additionally, Jennifer Pollono, the original costume designer, and Sophie Pollono, her daughter with John Pollono, also have roles in the film.[citation needed]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe adaptation was slated to premiere in March 2020 as part of the SXSW Festival's Narrative Spotlight.[6] Following the cancellation of the festival that year, the premiere was put on hold.
