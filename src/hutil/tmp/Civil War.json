Set in the near future, it follows a team of journalists traveling across the United States during a civil war which has engulfed the nation. The ensemble cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Cailee Spaeny, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Sonoya Mizuno, Nick Offerman, and Jesse Plemons.\nCivil War premiered at South by Southwest on March 14, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by A24 and in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film Distributors on April 12, 2024. It received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $38 million worldwide.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMap depicting the division of the United States in the movie\u00a0 Loyalist states\u00a0 Western Forces\u00a0 Florida Alliance\u00a0 New People's Army\nA civil war has erupted between an authoritarian United States government and various regional factions. The president, who is serving a third term,[a] claims that victory is close at hand. Renowned war photographer Lee Smith saves aspiring photojournalist Jessie from a suicide bombing in Brooklyn. \nLee and her colleague Joel intend to travel to Washington, D.C., to interview and photograph the president before the city falls. Lee's mentor Sammy asks to accompany them as far as Charlottesville, where the Western Forces (\"WF\") of Texas and California are assembling. Despite Lee's hesitance, she and Joel agree. Unbeknownst to Lee, Jessie convinces Joel to take her with them as well.\nAfter departing the city, the group stops at a rural gas station protected by armed men. Lee successfully negotiates a purchase of fuel with Canadian dollars. Meanwhile, Jessie wanders off to a nearby car wash she saw from the road. There she finds two men being tortured by the owners, who claim that the men are looters. One owner follows Jessie, but Lee defuses the situation by taking a photo of the man posed with his victims. After leaving, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos.\nFollowing an overnight stop close to ongoing fighting, the group document the combat the next day as militiamen assault a building held by loyalists. Lee sees Jessie's potential as a war photographer while Jessie photographs the militia executing captured loyalist soldiers. Continuing on, the group spend the night at a refugee camp before passing through a small town where, under watchful guard, residents attempt to live in blissful ignorance. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a local shop. \nLater, they are pinned down in a sniper battle amid the remains of a Christmas fair. The snipers they are with mock Joel's attempts to ascertain which party they are fighting for or against, telling Joel that they and the sniper in a nearby house are simply engaged in a struggle for survival. Jessie's nerve builds and her photography skills improve as she witnesses several deaths, and she develops a mentorship under Lee. Jessie asks if Lee would photograph Jessie being killed, and Lee implies she might. \nWhile driving, the foursome encounter two other reporters they know, Tony and Bohai. Tony and Jessie playfully switch vehicles, only for Bohai and Jessie to be captured by militants who are dumping civilian corpses in a mass grave. The rest of the group tries to intervene, but a xenophobic militant kills Bohai and asks where the others are from, killing Tony when he says Hong Kong. Sammy saves the group by running over two of the militants, but is shot by a third and dies as they flee. \nArriving at the Western Forces military camp in Charlottesville, the group grieves in different ways. Lee takes a photo of Sammy's corpse, but deletes it shortly after. Joel gets drunk and begins to become hysterical. Jessie floats around the campsite. Two fellow reporters inform the group that the government's defenders have mostly surrendered, leaving Washington largely unprotected. They follow the WF as Jessie's photography becomes increasingly risky, while Lee has a brief post-traumatic stress disorder episode and is unable to take pictures. \nIn the besieged capital, the president's limousine unsuccessfully attempts to flee the White House grounds with escort, but Lee intuits that the president is still in the building and leads her group inside. The WF follow, and face off with the remaining Secret Service. When Jessie exposes herself to gunfire to get a photo of the ensuing gunfight in the West Wing, Lee pushes her to safety. Jessie photographs her mentor as she is killed in the crossfire.\nThe WF soldiers capture the president in the Oval Office. Joel tells them to stop so that he can get a quote. The president begs Joel for mercy, \"Please, don't let them kill me\", a quote with which Joel is satisfied. Jessie takes a photo of the president's summary execution. During the credits, a developing photo of smiling WF soldiers posing with the president's corpse appears.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKirsten Dunst as Lee Smith, a renowned war photojournalist from Colorado.[6] She is said to be the youngest-ever member of the Magnum Photos cooperative. The character's first name is a reference to famed World War II photojournalist Lee Miller.[7]\nWagner Moura as Joel, a Reuters journalist from Florida and Lee's colleague\nCailee Spaeny as Jessie Cullen, an aspiring young photographer from Missouri who accompanies Lee and Joel on their journey\nStephen McKinley Henderson as Sammy, a veteran journalist for The New York Times and Lee's mentor\nNick Offerman as the President of the United States, a dictatorial president currently serving his third term[6]\nSonoya Mizuno as Anya, a British reporter embedded with the Western Forces' advance on the capital\nJefferson White as Dave, Anya's cameraman\nNelson Lee as Tony, a Hongkonger reporter who is good friends with Lee and Joel\nEvan Lai as Bohai, a Hongkonger reporter who is a colleague of Tony\nJesse Plemons as an ultranationalist militant who holds the journalists at gunpoint. Plemons was not credited for the role.[8][9]\nKarl Glusman as a spotter\nJin Ha as a sniper\nJojo T. Gibbs as a Western Forces Sergeant involved with the attack on the White House\nJuani Feliz as Secret Service Agent Joy Butler\nJames Yaegashi as Commercial Corporal, the leader of a militia group that assaults a loyalist position\nGreg Hill as Pete, an armed man guarding a gas station\nEdmund Donovan as Eddie, another of the armed men at the gas station\nJess Matney as a checkpoint soldier\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment and casting[edit]\nIn January 2022, Deadline reported that Alex Garland had signed on to write and direct the film for A24 with DNA Films co-producing. Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson and Cailee Spaeny were confirmed to star.[10] In April, Karl Glusman was announced[by whom?] as part of the cast.[11] In a May interview with The Daily Telegraph, Garland described the film as a companion piece to his 2022 film Men, and said it is \"set at an indeterminate point in the future\u2014just far enough ahead for me to add a conceit\u2014and serves as a sci-fi allegory for our currently polarized predicament\". In the same interview, Sonoya Mizuno was revealed as part of the cast, having appeared in all of Garland's previous films.[12]\nJesse Plemons, Dunst's husband, was quickly cast in the uncredited role at Dunst's suggestion after the originally cast actor became unavailable a few days before shooting began. Garland called Plemons' availability \"a stunning bit of good luck.\"[8][9]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in Atlanta on March 15, 2022.[13][14] By May, production had moved to London.[15] The production budget for Civil War was $50 million, making it A24's most expensive film.[2] The movie was shot on the prosumer DJI Ronin 4D camera.[16][17]\nIn a March 2024 interview with The Guardian, Garland stated that after Civil War, he intends to step back from directing and focus only on writing.[18]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film's world premiere at South by Southwest\nCivil War had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 14, 2024, with favourable reactions from the audience and to positive reviews from the critics.[19][20]\nThe film was previously scheduled to be released on April 26, 2024.[21][22] It was released on April 12, 2024, in the United States by A24 and in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film, with engagements in IMAX and Dolby Cinema.[23][24]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $18\u201324 million from 3,838 theaters (the widest-ever R-rated release by an independent studio) in its opening weekend.[25] The film made $10.8 million on its first day, including $2.9 million from Thursday night previews (a record for an A24 release). It went on to debut to $25.7 million, surpassing Hereditary as the biggest opening weekend in A24's history as well as the studio's first film to top the box office.[3] The opening weekend audience skewed male at 63%, while 57% of attendees were between ages 18\u201334. IMAX contributed over 16% of the opening weekend gross, with the main reasons given for seeing the film being its subject matter, the action, and a general interest in indie films (each grouping made up a third of the audience, with the former narrowly higher).[26] The Hollywood Reporter reported that ticket buyers were equally conservative and liberal, while Deadline wrote that 52% were left-wing (22% Liberal, 19% Democrats, and 11% moderate) and 17% were right-wing.[3][26]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nDunst at the film's world premiere. Her performance was widely praised, including by those who reviewed the film more negatively.[27]\nFollowing the SXSW premiere, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes noted that critics called the film \"a gorgeously shot cautionary tale full of big ideas and a fantastic performance by Kirsten Dunst, but it may surprise some viewers\". Critics praised the \"beauty and intensity of the dystopian drama\", while noting its \"potential for controversy and disappointment\" due to the effectiveness of its messages.[27] On the site, 80% of 314 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Tough and unsettling by design, Civil War is a gripping close-up look at the violent uncertainty of life in a nation in crisis.\"[28] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 61 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[29] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 76% overall positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3]\nIn a positive review, Peter Debruge of Variety wrote: \"Garland's the last person to suggest a group hug. As statements go, his powerful vision leaves us shaken, effectively repeating the question that quelled the L.A. riots: Can we all get along?\"[30] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph awarded the movie five stars out of five, writing: \"The Ex Machina director's vision of an imploding America is neither anti-Trump nor anti-woke. Instead it's as riveting as cinema gets.\"[31] Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com, compared Civil War to films about \"Western journalists covering the collapse of foreign countries\", such as The Year of Living Dangerously and Welcome to Sarajevo, ultimately praising the film as \"furiously convincing and disturbing\".[32]\nLovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review, writing: \"With the precision and length of its violent battle sequences, it's clear Civil War operates as a clarion call. Garland wrote the film in 2020 as he watched cogs on America's self-mythologizing exceptionalist machine turn, propelling the nation into a nightmare. With this latest film, he sounds the alarm, wondering less about how a country walks blindly into its own destruction and more about what happens when it does.\"[33] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times echoed the sentiment, writing \"rarely have I seen a movie that made me so acutely uncomfortable or watched an actor's face that, like Dunst's, expressed a nation's soul-sickness so vividly that it felt like an X-ray.\"[34]\nSome critics had mixed reactions. The Washington Post's Amy Nicholson described the film as \"coldly, deliberately incurious about the combatants and the victims\", but also said \"the film feels poetically, deeply true, even when it\u2019s suggesting that humans are more apt to tear one another apart for petty grievances than over a sincere defense of some kind of principles.\"[35][36]\nValerie Complex of Deadline Hollywood offered negative comments, saying: \"The script's utilization of characters of color as conduits for brutality needed to be explored further. ... Ultimately, Civil War feels like a missed opportunity. The director's vision of a fractured America, embroiled in conflict, holds the potential for introspection on our current societal divisions. However, the film's execution, hampered by thin characterization, a lackluster narrative and an overreliance on spectacle over substance, left me disengaged.\"[37]\nJohnny Oleksinski of the New York Post observed: \"Civil War's shtick is that it's not specifically political. For instance, as the US devolves into enemy groups of secessionist states, Texas and California have banded together to form the Western Forces. That such an alliance could ever occur is about as likely as [a] Sweetgreen/Kentucky Fried Chicken combo restaurant.\"[38] Eisa Nefertari Ulen, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, also found that the film was partially missing its point, stating, \"Casablanca endures because it spoke to a moment as \"crazy and mixed-up\" as this one, and nudged the country away from its isolationist inaction. Civil War does not resonate like that classic, because it does not explicitly address this moment. We as a people cannot fix a problem we cannot name.\"[citation needed]\nStephanie Zacharek of Time observed: \"Civil War has the vibe of your standard desolate zombie movie with a modern American backdrop, but it's far less effective than your average George A. Romero project: sometimes a B movie with a sense of humor about itself says more about a nation's despair than an overserious, breast-beating one. ... Do we really need a movie to invent, and rub our noses in, the possibility of a bleaker future?\"[39]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The operative status of the 22nd Amendment is not mentioned in the film.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Civil War (15)\".
