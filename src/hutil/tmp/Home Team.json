Inspired by actual events, the film tells the story of New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton who coached his 12-year-old son's football team during his one-year suspension from the NFL.\nHome Team was produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions and James's Hey Eddie Productions, and filmed in New Orleans from May to June 2021. It was released on January 28, 2022, by Netflix.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTwo years after the New Orleans Saints won Super Bowl XLIV, head coach Sean Payton is involved in the Bountygate scandal and suspended from the NFL for one year. While he's awaiting the results of his appeal, he returns to his hometown to reconnect with his 12-year-old son Connor.\nNot knowing how long he'll stay, Sean checks into a local hotel for 5 days and heads to his old middle-school Liberty Christian in Argyle, Texas. Showing up to the football team's game unannounced, his ex-wife Beth and her new husband Jaime call him over.\nConnor wonders why his father has come, and Sean explains he just wants to get to know him. Beth and Jaime invite him to their barbecue the next afternoon. Sean introduces himself to coach Jay. At the BBQ, Connor's teammate friends are friendly, but he remains distant.\nWatching the practices, Sean occasionally shouts out suggestions to Connor and others take notice. Known around town, other parents encourage him to help out with their kids as he sees fit. At the next game, as he sees a way to help the team, Sean pops down and gives advice to Troy, securing the team's first touchdown of the season.\nTroy hunts down Sean that evening, convincing him to join them as the team's offensive coordinator. At the first game after the kids have the new playbook it's obvious they don't get it, so he shows them using nacho ingredients as props. Soon the Warriors are winning every game.\nHowever, facing the state champs the Porcupines, the Warriors are intimidated. The aggressive, much larger players cream them. Although dejected, they are reminded that they wouldn't have to play them again until the final. They go on to win all of their following matches, their semi-final is won in heavy rain as the kids projectile vomit, caused by natural energy wraps provided by Jaime.\nIn the final, Sean runs their two best players in both offense and defense in the first half, making them exhausted, but keeping the lead. Finally, in the last quarter, he puts the two benched defensive players back in and has their kicker Harlan, who hasn't scored one all season, to go for the tie. He misses, but the team rejoices as he knocks out the scoreboard.\nHeading back to New Orleans, before Sean leaves he organises Connor's future visit to see him and the team. Back in his office, Sean proudly places the second place middle school trophy next to his Super Bowl one as a janitor named Lionel enters his office.\n\nCast[edit]\nKevin James as Sean Payton, the coach of the New Orleans Saints.\nTaylor Lautner as Troy Lambert\nJackie Sandler as Beth, Sean's ex-wife.\nRob Schneider as Jamie, Beth's current husband.\nTait Blum as Connor Payton, the son of Sean Payton and Beth and the stepson of Jamie.\nGary Valentine as Mitch Bizone\nMaxwell Simkins as Paulie\nChloe Fineman as Emily, an intern\nJacob Perez as Marcos\nBryant Tardy as Dennis\nManny Magnus as Harlan\nLiam Kyle as Nate\nChristopher Farrar as Jason\nMerek Mastrov as Brian\nIsaiah Mustafa as Porcupine Coach\nChristopher Titone as Will\nAshley D.
