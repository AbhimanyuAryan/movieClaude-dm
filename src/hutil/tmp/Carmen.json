The film stars Melissa Barrera, Paul Mescal, Rossy de Palma and The D.O.C..\nThough described as Millepied's take on Bizet's opera of the same name,[4][5] it is \"a complete re-imagining\" that ignores the opera's plot and setting; all that remains are \"selected lyrics\" from the opera's libretto sung in the original French by a choir as background to one scene between the two leads.[6] The film features an original score composed by Nicholas Britell with songs written and composed by Brittell, Taura Stinson, Julieta Venegas and Curry.[7]\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2022. It was released in the United States on 21 April 2023 by Sony Pictures Classics, in France on 14 June 2023 by Path\u00e9 Distribution, and in Australia on 13 July by Madman Films.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nCarmen flees the Mexican desert, is rescued by Aidan, and together they struggle to evade the authorities as they head for Los Angeles.[7]\n\nCast[edit]\nMelissa Barrera as Carmen\nPaul Mescal as Aidan\nRossy de Palma as Masilda\nTracy \"The DOC\" Curry as Referee\nNicole da Silva as Julieanne\nBenedict Hardie as Mike\nElsa Pataky as Gabrielle\nTara Morice as Marie\nMarina Tamayo II as Zilah\nProduction[edit]\nIn May 2017, Benjamin Millepied was set to make his feature film directorial debut with the film version of Carmen for Chapter 2, originally conceived as \"a modern-day reimagining of one of the world's most celebrated operas\".[4] Once completed, Millepied recognized his film was less an adaptation than \"a version of Bizet's tragedy from a parallel universe\".[8] Lo\u00efc Barr\u00e8re\u00a0[fr] and Millepied will write the script. In May 2019, Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights for the film and Nilo Cruz would write the script.[9] In November 2020, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. was revealed to have co-written the script with Millepied and Lo\u00efc Barr\u00e8re.[10]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn May 2019, it was announced that Melissa Barrera and Jamie Dornan were cast as Carmen and Aidan, respectively.[9] In November 2020, Paul Mescal replaced Dornan and Rossy de Palma was cast in the film.[10]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced on 18 January 2021 in Australia with J\u00f6rg Widmer as the cinematographer,[10] and wrapped in early March 2021.[11]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Carmen (soundtrack)\nNicholas Britell composed the score and co-wrote the songs with Julieta Venegas, Taura Stinson and Tracy \"The DOC\" Curry.[9][10] Lynn Fainchtein served as music producer and music supervisor.\n\nRelease[edit]\nCarmen had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2022.[7] It had a limited theatrical release in the United States on 21 April 2023 by Sony Pictures Classics,[12] and was released theatrically in France on 14 June 2023 by Path\u00e9 Distribution[13][14] and in Australia on 13 July by Madman Films.[15]\nThe film was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on 11 July 2023.[16]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 62% of 98 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Benjamin Millepied reinvents Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's tragic novella as a dance extravaganza full of sound and fury signifying a hollow emotional core, although the ravishing style is a treat onto itself.\"[17] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[18]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nToronto International Film Festival\n\nSeptember 18, 2022\n\nFIPRESCI Prize\n\nCarmen\n\nNominated\n\n[19]\n\n\nMiami Film Festival\n\nMarch 12, 2023\n\nJordan Ressler First Feature Award\n\nBenjamin Millepied\n\nNominated\n\n[20]\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nMusic Themed Film, Biopic, or Musical\n\nCarmen\n\nNominated\n\n[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Carmen (15)\".
