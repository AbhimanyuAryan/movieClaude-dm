He retired from acting in 2022 because he was diagnosed with aphasia, and was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023.[16][17][18]\n\nRelease[edit]\nAssassin was released by Saban Films in select theaters and VOD on March 31, 2023.[19][18] The film was originally set to be released in September 2022, under the title Die Like Lovers.[20]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAs of January 3, 2024, Assassin grossed $66,813 in Turkey, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.[2][3]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 9% of 11 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4/10.[21]\nDennis Harvey, of Variety, gave the film a negative review, writing that \"the multinational cast seems assembled for reasons other than serving defined character needs. None of them are able to rise above the vague material\".[22] Richard Roeper, of Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film a 2/5 rating, saying \"it's sad to see Bruce Willis in his final film, lacking his trademark twinkle\".[23] Robert Kojder, of Flickering Myth, gave the film a 1.5/5 rating, summarizing that it's \"an illogical and dull flick that doesn't even thrill when it shifts into action mode\".[24]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Assassin (15)\".
