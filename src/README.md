# Source Folder

In this folder we can find the source code for this project and its requirements. 
The project itself is divided in the actual pipeline and the tools developed to gather information. 


With this in mind the two main files for the project are:
- 'basic_pipeline' - This pipeline representes the "normal" usage of the language model and data of this project. This represents the firs iteration of this project and it's used for testing and improving the advanced pipeline.
- 'advanced_pipeline' - This pipeline builds on the "basic_pipeline" to further improve the awnsers and recomendations made by the large language model. This component is more complex and it's still under development.

Furthermore, to collect the data we have the "*util" folders. Inside each one of them we provide a scriptthat allows gathering information for the movies depending on their origins.
