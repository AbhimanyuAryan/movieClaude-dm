Sam has a fragile and intimate relationship with her boyfriend, a film actor named Om Kapoor, as he reciprocates feelings whenever he likes. On Sam's birthday party at her apartment where all her friends and colleagues are invited, she is broken when Om doesn't attend the party. Vivek helps clean her flat, and Sam suddenly breaks down and reveals everything about her and Om's relationship to Vivek in a drunken state. Vivek tries to console her, and in the process, Sam kisses him. Vivek then reciprocates, and they have passionate sex. The next morning, Sam wakes up and is shocked to see Vivek sleeping next to her. Om rings the doorbell, and Sam gets worried. Vivek says it's okay, to which Sam says she will talk to him later.\nSam is still thinking about the previous night in the office meeting, to which her boss shouts at her for being absent-minded in the forum. Vivek, who is outside, hears this and, in response, gets food for Sam and sends everyone else for lunch. Sam is disturbed and warns Vivek that whatever happened the previous night was a mistake, and warns him from interfering in her personal life. The next day, however, Sam sees that she cannot enter her office when her boss informs her that some personal files of the company have been hacked from her laptop. Confused, Sam receives a call from Vivek, who reveals that he hacked Sam's laptop and leaked the company's files to teach Sam's boss a lesson. Vivek had previously hacked into the police records and uploaded a mobile vendor's name as most wanted because he refused to repair Sam's phone. Sam calls Vivek to a cafe and asks him to revert what he has done. Vivek reveals that he loves her and can do anything for her, in response to which Sam slaps him in front of everyone and warns him to stay away from her. Vivek gets enraged at the incident. He makes the tech experts at Sam's company believe that Sam leaked the files, which gets her fired. Om takes Sam to vacation in Goa for Sam to be relaxed again. Vivek captures images of Sam and Om getting intimate and leaks them on to the internet. Om publicly denies their relationship, which leaves Sam heartbroken. Sam agrees to remove the life support of her dying mother as she had no chance of living. Along with her neighbor Rohan Mehra, she then lodges a complaint against Vivek for his activities.\nThe police arrest Vivek in front of his grandmother. He is then sent for interrogation, but in the process, threatens a police officer by hacking into his phone and tells him he will reveal the secret of his adultery to his wife. The officer is forced to leave Vivek, who later hacks Sam's Facebook (or Facelook as per the pronunciation in the film), Instagram (or Insta-frame as per the pronunciation in the film) and Twitter account(s) and put on a post saying that her life is not going well and she is depressed. Enraged, Rohan goes over to Vivek's house and beats him up. In the series of incidents that follow, Sam finds out that Rohan was her childhood friend. Sam feels suspicious about Vivek's maid as she has an expensive Yves Saint Laurent bag and also knew that Vivek was not rich enough to buy that bag. Sam encounters the maid, Riya, who explains to Sam that Vivek is actually a shameless and cruel person who used to stalk her, and when she rejected his love, Vivek threatened to release some of her secrets on the internet, which could ruin her life. Vivek forced Riya to come to his house to work as a maid so that no one would feel suspicious. She also says that he had ruined his classmate Sheetal's life like this, which caused her to commit suicide and make Vivek drop out of college.\nVivek kills his grandmother after she threatens him with exposing his true nature because he dropped out of college and has been lying to his family for months. In the end, Sam manages to make a plan and takes revenge by killing him just after he wipes all the evidence which would prove that Sam was with him. With no evidence to prove who killed Vivek, the case is closed. Sam is shown walking out of the office with Rohan, seemingly indicating that Sam has started a new life.\n\nCast[edit]\nHina Khan as Sameera Khanna aka Sam\nRohan Shah as Vivek Tiwari\u00a0: Sam's Hacker\nSid Makkar as Om Kapoor\u00a0: Sam's ex Boyfriend\nMohit Malhotra as Rohan Mehra\u00a0: Sam's Childhood Friend\nPravina Deshpande as Mrs. Tiwari (Vivek's grandmother)\nSheetal Dabholkar as Nandini Sahai (Sam's boss)\nGarrvil Mohan as Dr. Ravi Sinha\nTanvi Thakkar as Ria (Vivek's fake maid)\nMusic[edit]\nHackedSoundtrack album by Arko, Jeet Gannguli, Chirantan Bhatt, Sunny and Inder Bawra and Amjad Nadeem AamirReleased13 January 2020[5]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength26:53LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyExternal audio Official Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThe film's music is composed by Arko, Jeet Gannguli, Chirantan Bhatt, Sunny and Inder Bawra and Amjad Nadeem Aamir, with lyrics written by Arko, Amjad Nadeem, Shakeel Azmi, Manoj Yadav and Kumaar.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Mehfooz\"ArkoArkoArko3:142.\"Ab Na Phir Se\"Amjad NadeemAmjad Nadeem AamirYasser Desai4:073.\"Tu Jo Mili\"Shakeel AzmiJeet GannguliYasser Desai3:404.\"Lavkar Love Karuya\"Manoj YadavChirantan BhattApeksha Dandekar2:575.\"Tujhe Hasil Karunga\"KumaarSunny and Inder BawraStebin Ben3:566.\"Hacked Theme\"-Sunny and Inder Bawra-1:217.\"Ab Na Phir Se\" (Version 2)Amjad NadeemAmjad Nadeem AamirNikhita Gandhi4:238.\"Mehfooz\" (Version 2)ArkoArkoAkanksha Sharma3:15Total length:26:53\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was theatrically released in India on 7 February 2020.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Hacked\".
