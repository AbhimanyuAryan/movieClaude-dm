It stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Avneet Kaur in lead roles.[4][5] The film premiered on 23 June 2023 on Amazon Prime Video.[6]\n\n\nCast[edit]\nNawazuddin Siddiqui as Shiraz \"Sheru\" Khan Afghani\nAvneet Kaur as Tasleem \"Tiku\" Khan\nKhushi Bhardwaj as Sana, Tiku's sister\nMukesh Bhatt as Anand\nVipin Sharma as Shahid\nZakir Hussain as Ahmed Rizvi\nSuresh Vishwakarma as Chandresh Bhund\nGhanshyam Garg as Raza Ali Khan\nMurari Kumar as Mukhtar\nAakash Pandey as Mahesh\nShubhankar Das as Yakub\nRahoul as Binni\nSatish Nayakodi as ACP Prabhakar\nAslam Wadkar as Inspector Kadam\nTanya Desai as Pinki\nMadhavi Lawre as Suman\nAradhana Sharma as Rita\nLesan Karimova as Natasha\nAseem Dubey as Tiku's father\nMeenu Singh as Tiku's mother\nSagar Rambhia as News anchor\nSanju Kumar as Guard 1\nAnjani Kumar as Guard 2\nKangana Ranaut as Herself (special appearance)\nSynopsis[edit]\nTiku Weds Sheru film is billed as a tale of two eccentric, starry eyed characters, who want to make it big in Bollywood. The film is a kind of love letter to those who come to this city, but lose their way yet end up finding something much more meaningful. Ranaut described the movie as a heartfelt ode to Mumbai, the city of dreams.[7][8]\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe film was initially titled as \"Divine Lovers\", with Irrfan Khan and Kangana Ranaut as main leads in 2016.[9][10] The film got stalled because director Sai Kabir felt severely ill for three to four years. When the filmmaker went back to working on the script, Irrfan passed away in April 2020. Kangana was also not in the same frame of mind that she was eight to ten years ago.[11] Hence they decided to bring in a new cast.[12]\nThe film is Kangana's maiden production after the launch of her production house in 2020.[13]\n\nCasting[edit]\nLead actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Avneet Kaur, with producer Kangana Ranaut, at the film's wrap-up party.\nAfter Irrfan Khan's demise, Nawazuddin Siddiqui was cast for the male lead,[14][15] and Avneet Kaur was finalized as the female lead.[16]\nBesides the fresh pairing, casting brought to the fore the old debate of the huge age gap between the male and the female actor.[17] On this, Ranaut expressed that she overlooked 27-year age gap between the stars as the pair seemed her well-suited for the storyline,[18] and Kaur stated that she does not see the age gap as a problem as it was a requirement for the film.[19][20]\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe film's pre-production began in October 2021.[21] Principal photography began on 8 November 2021 in Mumbai,[22][23][24] outdoor schedule began on 20 December 2021 in Bhopal[25][26] and its last schedule began on 22 January 2022 back in Mumbai.[27][28] The film wrapped up on 1 February 2022.[29][30]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nTiku Weds SheruSoundtrack album by Gaurav Chatterji and Sai KabirReleased23 June 2023[31]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength17:03LanguageHindiLabelSony Music India\nThe music for the film is composed by Gaurav Chatterji and Sai Kabir, while the lyrics are written by Shellee and Sai Kabir.

Right when Tiku is introduced, her age gap with Sheru is quickly addressed that a majority of the movies shy away from\".[39]  Kahkasha of Punjab Kesari gave the film 3 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \"The film is a mix of love story, drama, comedy and emotion\".[40] Shanti Nanisetti of Telangana Today gave the film 2.5 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \"The film is like a single pot dish \u2013 many ingredients are thrown in to see what surprise dish gets churned out\".[41] Filmfare gave a rating of 2.5 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \"Watch the film for the performances and also if you wish to see the grime beneath the glamour of Bollywood\".[42]\nGautaman Bhaskaran of CNN-IBN gave the film 2 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \"Tiku Weds Sheru looks quite jaded, and seems to be unsure of where to place itself\".[43] Shilajit Mitra of The Hindu wrote, \"Tiku Weds Sheru has the goods of a moving love story. But it does not deliver\".[44] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 2 (out of 5) and wrote, \"Tiku Weds Sheru wants to project itself as a film about a strong and spirited girl willing to go the distance in pursuit of her dream. But it frequently reduces the female protagonist to a damsel who paints herself into a corner and then needs to be rescued\".[45] Abhimanyu Mathur of DNA India gave 2 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \"Tiku Weds Sheru sees Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Avneet Kaur deliver sincere and earnest performances marred by a weak story and bad direction\".[46]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 1.5 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \"While Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Avneet Kaur are good fit for the roles, they never quite fit together and you can never overcome the queasiness caused by seeing Sheru slobbering over Tiku\".[47] Deepa Gahlot of Rediff gave the film 1 star (out of 5) and wrote, \"There is no redeeming feature in Tiku Weds Sheru, and that is also rare. Even the worst movies have a song, a scene, or a performance that makes all the effort of making a film worthwhile. This one should have been scrapped at script stage, if there was such thing on the table\".[48] Vijayalakshmi Narayanan of The Free Press Journal gave the film 1 star (out of 5) and wrote, \"From its sluggish pace, to cringe-inducing moments of romance and dialogue delivery to its misplaced music, Tiku Weds Sheru is an ill-fated union, best left unattended, unless you\u2019re looking for a cure to insomnia\".[49]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Bimal Roy's 'rare gem' on Tiku Weds Sheru sets, Ranaut thanked Fernando Gayesky, the DoP, for arranging the camera for her\".
