The film premiered on 7 July 2023 on JioCinema.[8] The film received negative reviews from critics and audience. This marks the last film appearance of Kapoor.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film followed the story of Gia Singh, who travelled to her mother\u2019s house one gloomy night. She was waiting for a Taxi, but instead of a taxi, a private car picked her up. But the car driver was not a common man; he was a psycho kidnapper who kidnapped the ladies and badly tortured them to death. Recently, some cases were filed in the police station for missing women, and followed by that, the sensible blind lady Gia Singh\u2019s sixth sense gave her doubt; she also stated the same to the police, but the COP took Gia lightly.\nThe missing cases were handled by the detective Prithvi. Very soon, he uncovers the chilling truth - this was no ordinary kidnapping spree; it was a meticulously orchestrated saga of serial abductions, intricately interwoven and interconnected.\nAssisted by Gia Singh, how Prithvi unravels the dark secrets and expose the malevolent orchestrator, forms the crux of the film.\n\nCast[edit]\nSonam Kapoor as Gia Singh\nPurab Kohli as a driver turned serial killer\nVinay Pathak as Prithvi Khanna\nLillete Dubey as Maria Aunty\nShubham Saraf as Nikhil\nDanesh Razvi as Adrian Pereira\nLucy Aarden\nJaved Khan as DCS - Tarun Bedi\nProduction[edit]\nThe principal photography commenced on 28 December 2020 in Scotland.[9][10] The film was wrapped up on 13 February 2021.[11][12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Sonam Kapoor Ahuja Announces Her New Film 'Blind', Shooting Kick-Starts in Glasglow\".
