It stars Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor as a troubled married couple.[1][2]\nFilming took place in multiple countries from April to August 2022. Initially scheduled for a theatrical release, Bawaal received a streaming release on Amazon Prime Video on 21 July 2023.[3]\nAt the 2023 Filmfare OTT Awards, Bawaal received 9 nominations, including Best Actor in a Web Original Film (Dhawan) and Best Actress in a Web Original Film (Kapoor).\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAjay Dixit is an image-conscious narcissist, who teaches history at a school in Lucknow. He hates his life of lies, despite the respect he is held in, thanks to his philosophical tendency to \"fake it till you make it\". He has grounded his beautiful epileptic wife Nisha, who is much more intelligent than him, since he does not want her seizures to ruin his reputation. \nAjay finds himself and his image in jeopardy when he slaps his student, Atul Raghuvanshi, in frustration over a doubt regarding World War II. Atul turns out to be the son of MLA Vishwas Raghuvanshi. Out of despair of wanting to escape the wrath of the MLA, Ajay decides to visit places across Europe he deems were important to World War II (inc. Anne Frank's house and Auschwitz). He takes Nisha along with him as his parents hope it could resolve their marital conflicts. This sets them on a journey that changes their entire perspectives and their views on interpersonal conflicts, as they cover both life and history lessons along the way.[citation needed]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nVarun Dhawan as Ajay Dixit\nJanhvi Kapoor  as Nisha Dixit\nManoj Pahwa as Mr. Dixit, Ajay's father\nAnjuman Saxena as Mrs. Dixit, Ajay's mother\nMukesh Tiwari  as MLA Vishwas Raghuvanshi\nPrateek Pachori as Bipin\nVyas Hemang as Kalpesh\nShashie Vermaa as Principal\nAgrim Mittal as Papon Chatterjee\nNikhil Chawla as Atul Raghuvanshi, Vishwas's son\nThibault Gouzarch as Thief\nProduction[edit]\nThe film title was announced along with its release date and the cast on 30 March 2022.[4]\nFilming began in April 2022, and was shot in Mumbai, Kanpur, Lucknow, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Krak\u00f3w, Warsaw, Auschwitz (present-day O\u015bwi\u0119cim) and in parts of Poland.[5] Sajid Nadiadwala announced that the filming completed in August 2022.[6][7]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nBawaalSoundtrack album by Mithoon, Tanishk Bagchi and Akashdeep SenguptaReleased23 July 2023Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength15:36LabelT-SeriesOfficial audioBawaal (Audio Jukebox) on YouTubeSingles from  Bawaal \n\"Tumhe Kitna Pyaar Karte\"Released: 7 July 2023\n\"Dil Se Dil Tak\"Released: 14 July 2023\n\"Dilon Ki Doriyan\"Released: 18 July 2023\n\n\nSoundtrack is composed by Mithoon, Tanishk Bagchi, Akashdeep Sengupta.

She further wrote that \n\"it is just a pity that rest of the film is so lacking in fun, pep, humour and charm that only its spectacularly poor taste stands out.\"[13]\nAmongst positive reviews, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the film 3 out of 5, writing, \"Director Nitesh Tiwari has a knack for creating intriguing characters and scenarios that feel fresh yet familiar at the same time. But the underlying goal behind all their actions -- questionable or inspirational -- is rooted in wisdom.\"[14]\nRabbi Abraham Cooper of the Jewish human rights organisation Simon Wiesenthal Center asked Amazon to \u201cstop monetising\u201d Bawaal with immediate effect and called the film a \u201cbanal trivialisation of the suffering and systematic murder of millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust\u201d.[15][16] On 28 July 2023, Embassy of Israel, New Delhi tweeted that the \"The Israeli embassy is disturbed by the trivialization of the significance of the Holocaust in the recent movie 'Bawaal'.\"[17] They also criticised the \"poor choice in the utilization of some terminology in the movie.\"[18]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee / work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2023\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nBest Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nVarun Dhawan\n\nNominated\n\n[19]\n\n\nBest Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nJanhvi Kapoor\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Story (Web Original Film)\n\nAshwiny Iyer Tiwari\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay (Web Original Film)\n\nNikhil Mehrotra, Shreyas Jain, Piyush Gupta, Nitesh Tiwari\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Background Music (Web Original Film)\n\nDaniel B.
