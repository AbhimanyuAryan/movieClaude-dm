Though Tarla's husband, Nalin, is all set to stand by her side with her choices, gender duties result in her imagination and desire taking a back seat. Despite being a pure vegetarian, Nalin's extreme liking for non-vegetarian food is a matter of surprise.\nShe started preparing vegetarian delicacies that followed non-vegetarian food items and gave them a run for their money. After teaching her neighbour's kid to cook, she started giving cooking classes, and this was the turning point in her journey to start a tribe in the world of cooking.[citation needed]\n\nCast[edit]\nHuma Qureshi as Tarla Dalal\nSharib Hashmi as Nalin Dalal[8]\nBharati Achrekar as Jaishree aunty, Tarla's  neighbor\nBhawana Somaaya as Tarla's professor\nAmarjeet Singh as Gafur\nRajeev Pandey as Makrand\nPurnendu Bhattacharya as Paragaon Textile CEO\nVeenah Naair as Renuka\nProduction[edit]\nThe shoots of Tarla started in April 2022.[9] Most of the film was shot in Mumbai.
