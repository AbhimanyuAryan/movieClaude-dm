The film is written and directed by Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah, in their directorial debuts, and produced by Maddock Films and Jio Studios.[5]\nPrincipal photography commenced in October 2022 and ended in April 2023. The film was released theatrically on 9 February 2024 to mixed-to-positive reviews from critics.[6] It became the seventh-highest-grossing Indian film of 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAryan Agnihotri is a Delhi-born smart robotics engineer based out of Mumbai, taking after his aunt, Urmila Shukla, who has a company of her own, E-Robotics, in California. She invites him to America, where he eventually meets the Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation alias SIFRA, Urmila's secretary, who looks and behaves like a human, a fact unknown to him. He falls in love with her but later learns that she is actually a robot and ploy used by his aunt to test if humans could tell SIFRA apart from themselves.\nHeartbroken, he returns to India and agrees to an arranged marriage. However, when he realizes his love for SIFRA, he decides to sneak out of the engagement ceremony and is caught by his grandfather, who suggests him to follow his heart and assures him that he will handle the family in his absence. Aryan wishes for SIFRA to be in India so that he could introduce her to his family; he calls up his aunt to ask her to send her to India for further \"testing\" against a traditional Indian family. She agrees for it and sends her to India, where Aryan introduces her as his girlfriend to his family leading to numerous comical situations.\nAryan's family, unaware that she is a robot, agree to their marriage. Before their wedding, she installs a faulty update ridden with a virus which corrupts her memory and causes her to forget everything. Aryan calls his aunt to ask for help, and she sends him a memory backup which Aryan installs, causing her to successfully recover her memory. Urmila, who was unaware of Aryan's intentions of marrying her, is against him after knowing the truth and orders him to return her as she is her company's IP. He manages to convince his aunt after an emotional conversation, who agrees to let him keep her.\nOn their wedding day, a blackout occurs while SIFRA is charging herself, which causes her to malfunction. Her speech becomes distorted and movements begin to glitch while she performs orders given to her previously that were taken back, one of them being \"setting Delhi on fire\". Looking at the destruction caused by her, a heartbroken Aryan is left with no choice but to stop her, ultimately by slashing her face with a sword, which reveals the inner technical workings of her, and realizes that even though she looks human, she can never truly be one.\nSometime later, Urmila launches a series of robots, including SIFRA 2.0. The new SIFRA has her memory and settings formatted and Aryan is no longer her admin. Jiah, a new intern, approaches Aryan and flirts with him. Looking at their bonding, the new SIFRA starts to feel jealous and Aryan notices her emotions, shocked of coming to the realization that she can have feelings of her own now.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nShahid Kapoor as Aryan \"Aaru\" Agnihotri\nKriti Sanon as SIFRA (Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation)\nDharmendra as Jai Singh Agnihotri (Aryan Agnihotri's GrandFather)\nDimple Kapadia as Urmila Shukla (Aryan Agnihotri's Aunt)\nRakesh Bedi as Papa\nAnubha Fatehpuria as Sharmila Agnihotri (Aryan Agnihotri's Mother)\nRajesh Kumar as Mama\nRaashul Tandon as Pappu\nGrusha Kapoor as Bua\nBrijbhushan Shukla as Foofa\nAshish Verma as Monty\nMaahi Raj Jain as Tim Tim\nShaunak Duggal as Chintu\nShivaani Sopuri as Pammi\nChittransh as Kapil\nAmisha Thakur as Myra\nRajan Kavatra as Inspector Gupta\nManish Kumar as Constable Gujjar\nAbhishek Gaikwad as Dubey Ji\nKamal Chellani as Vishal\nSuryansh Mishra as Kushal\nSnehal Shidam as Mangla\nRajan Tiwari as Pandit Ji\nJanhvi Kapoor as Jiah (special appearance)[7]\nProduction[edit]\nIn August 2022, Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon were signed to star in Dinesh Vijan's next robot rom-com.[8] Production began in October 2022 and ended in April 2023.[9] The film's title Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya was revealed in January 2024.[10]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nTeri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha JiyaSoundtrack album by Tanishk Bagchi, Sachin\u2013Jigar, Raghav, Mitraz, Talwiinder, MC Square and NDSReleased5 February 2024GenreFeature film soundtrackLength16:26LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesOfficial audioTeri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya (Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is composed by Tanishk Bagchi, Sachin\u2013Jigar, Raghav, Mitraz, Talwiinder, MC Square and NDS.
