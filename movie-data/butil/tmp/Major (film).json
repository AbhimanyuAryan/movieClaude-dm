The film focuses on the life of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan who was martyred in action in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, it stars Sesh as Unnikrishnan,which won him \nBest Actor at 11th South Indian International Movie Awards and co-stars Prakash Raj, Sobhita Dhulipala, Saiee Manjrekar, Revathi, Murali Sharma, and Anish Kuruvilla. Major is produced by G. Mahesh Babu Entertainment, Sony Pictures International Productions, and A+S Movies.\nFilmed simultaneously in Telugu and Hindi languages, it follows the personal and professional life of Sandeep Unnikrishnan. Principal photography began in February 2020 and ended in December 2021. Filming experienced delays owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Made on a budget of \u20b932 crores, it was shot in 120 days and was filmed in over 75 locations.\nMajor had limited theatrical release on 24 May 2022 in selected cities across India and it was released worldwide on 3 June 2022. The film received positive reviews from critics praising the direction, screenplay, writing, emotional weight, score, cinematography, action sequences, and cast performances (particularly that of Sesh) and eventually became a commercial success grossing \u20b964\u221266 crore worldwide and is one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2022. The Hindi version is featured at the 53rd International Film Festival of India in the Indian Panorama section.[4]In addition to being filmed in Telugu and Hindi, the film was also dubbed in Malayalam.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe movie starts with Sandeep Unnikrishnan entering the POK, which the Pakistani Army considers a threat and orders him to retreat. When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies \"It is ours\". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha. Sandeep applied to join the Indian Navy without telling his parents, much to the fury of Unnikrishnan. However, the Navy rejected Sandeep's application, causing Sandeep to ultimately join the army. As the years progressed, Sandeep rises  ranks to become an NSG training officer.\nIn 2008, Sandeep is well established in his career as a training officer for the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG and is married to Isha, but their marriage is in trouble. Sandeep asks for leave to try and save his marriage. On the same day as Sandeep's leave though, Pakistani terrorists arrive in Mumbai by boat and they proceed to orchestrate deadly attacks in the city. Desperately crowds start heading to the Taj Hotel for safety but the terrorists also enter the hotel and start shooting at staff and guests spontaneously. The local police are called to the scene but they are ill-equipped to deal with the threat. Upon discovering the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Sandeep requests Commander Shera to allow him to participate in the NSG mission to neutralize the terrorist threat. They leave for Mumbai and commence the military counterterrorism operation: Operation Black Tornado, but the NSG encounters numerous obstacles and problems upon arriving at the scene. They lack surveillance cameras to discover the number of people inside the building.\nThe terrorists have installed deadly booby traps and tripwires with bombs throughout the premises. Several hotel staff and guests end up crowded together in a locked room, all bound and gagged on the floor. To make matters worse there is an intrusive media circus swarming outside the hotel reporting the NSG's known operations and movements, information which the terrorists use. Meanwhile, a guest named Pramoda Reddy, who is trapped on the fifth floor, manages to keep herself hidden from the gunmen. She ultimately takes responsibility to rescue a British tourist's young daughter, named Shirley. Sandeep talks to Isha over the phone. She is applying for divorce and scolds Sandeep for not being there with her when she had a miscarriage, but she is horrified when she discovers that Sandeep is at the Taj Hotel. As the NSG rescue more hostages (several of whom remain tied up inside a locked banquet hall) and starts closing in on the remaining terrorists, Pramoda calls the downstairs lobby using a walkie-talkie from one of the dead security guards.\nSandeep ultimately decides to go to the 5th floor to save them, saying that he would never be able to forgive himself if he did not save her. His colleagues subsequently use tear gas and Sandeep races up to the 5th floor. He ultimately rescues Pramoda and Shirley and heroically kills almost all of the terrorists single-handedly but is shot and stabbed multiple times in the process. However, when his CO asks him whether he needs reinforcement or not, he refuses. His last words are \"Do not come up, I will handle them.\" But as fate would have it, he finally dies from his wounds, all alone, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action. They had thought that since Sandeep was a training officer he was not involved in the rescue mission at the Taj Hotel. After his death, there is a large military funeral and a crowd of well-wishers gather to mourn Sandeep's passing. Isha is devastated at Sandeep's death and discovers that he never signed the divorce papers. Later, a 10-year commemoration ceremony in 2018 honoring the lives taken during the attack is held at the Taj Hotel. During the commemorations, Pramoda is reunited with Shirley whose life she had saved. Mr. Unnikrishnan gives an impassioned speech in which he says that Sandeep should be remembered not for how he died, but for how he lived.\nAs Unnikrishnan recalls during his speech, a flashback shows the continuation of the beginning of the movie. It is shown that Sandeep was playing cricket with the children from PoK ( illegally occupied part of Kashmir by Pakistan ), and when he was called back, he waves goodbye and promises the children that he would come to play another time.\n\nCast[edit]\nAdivi Sesh as Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan\nAmancharla Rama Kausik as young Sandeep\nPrakash Raj as K.

Mahesh Babu Entertainment, in collaboration with Sony Pictures International Productions and A+S Movies.[7][8] Major is shot simultaneously in Telugu and Hindi languages. Despite consisting of a predominantly Telugu cast and crew, director Sashi Kiran Tikka said that they opted to shoot the film in Hindi as well since the film is set in North India where Hindi is the dominant language.[9]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPart of the film was shot at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020.

The screenplay and direction work for the film. This action-drama is not preachy, and the film does not lead with a patriotic tone\".[31] A critic for Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Major movie is a fitting tribute to Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan. It's a classic film version of a story that deserves to be told!\".[32] Manoj Kumar R of The Indian Express rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Major is far from being perfect.

It's a masterstroke at one level\".[35] Mayank Shekhar of Mid-Day rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"It recreates 26/11 with just enough creative liberties to remain believable still. It moves you, with a fine measure of empathy and patriotism\".[36] Shubham Kulkarni of Koimoi rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"With some flaws, you can give Major a chance for its gripping second half\".[37] Sukanya Verma (Suku) of Rediff rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Major is in a perennial state of exaggeration. The sighs, the misty eyes, the mushy speeches, its details are invested in highlighting all things in-your-face.\"[38]\n\nBox office[edit]\nMajor grossed \u20b964\u201366 crore gross worldwide.[2][3] The film amassed a huge distributor share of \u20b933.35 crore and emerged as a blockbuster at the box office.[2]\nOn its opening day, Major grossed \u20b913.10 crore with a distributor's share of \u20b97.12 crore.[27] According to trade analyst Taran Adarsh, the film made a net collection of \u20b94.66 crore domestically from the Hindi version in its first weekend.[39] As of 10\u00a0June\u00a02022[update] the film grossed \u20b950.7 crore (US$6.3\u00a0million).[40] After 13 days of its release, the film grossed \u20b960 crore worldwide as reported by The Times of India.[41][42]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nCeremony\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominee\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2023\n\nSouth Indian International Movie Awards\n\nBest Actor Critics \u2013 Telugu\n\nAdivi Sesh\n\nWon\n\n[43]\n\n\nBest Debut Producer\n\nA+S Movies (Sharath Chandra, Anurag Mayreddy)\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Film\n\nG.
