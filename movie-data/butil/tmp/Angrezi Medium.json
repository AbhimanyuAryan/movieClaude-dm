A standalone sequel to the 2017 film Hindi Medium, the film stars Irrfan Khan, Radhika Madan, Deepak Dobriyal and Kareena Kapoor Khan. Filming began in Udaipur on 5 April 2019 and was completed by July in London. This was Irrfan's final film to be released before his death on 29 April 2020.[4]\nThe film was theatrically released in India on 13 March 2020.[5] With its theatrical performance affected by the closing of cinemas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, plans for a re-release were cancelled and the film was made available digitally less than a month after its release on Disney+ Hotstar.[6]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nChampak Bansal is a widower and a sweet-shop owner in Udaipur, Rajasthan. He often fights with his half-brother Gopi, who runs a competing sweet-shop, but they're greatly fond of each other.\nChampak's daughter Tarika has always harboured a dream to travel and study abroad. Though she is poor in studies, Champak is strongly supportive of her dream, and, with some effort, she secures a high rank in her final school examinations, enough for her to secure a scholarship from London's Truford University, which has partnered with her school.\nOn the school's Annual Day, Champak notices that the chief guest is Judge Chheda, who had accepted a watch as a bribe from Gopi a few days before so that he could win the rights to the Ghasiteram name. He goes on stage and exposes the judge who had emphasised on honesty and values in his speech, not knowing that he is the principal's husband. The following morning, he meets the principal at her home and asks for forgiveness, only for her to tear Tarika's scholarship letter to pieces and throw it on his face. He vows to send Tarika to London, come what may.\nWith the help of a London-based acquaintance, Bablu, Champak and Tarika along with Gopi proceed to London so that Tarika can find accommodation there till college opens. However, Champak and Gopi are caught and interrogated by the airport police. When they inadvertently say that they have 'drugs', they are deported and their passports blacklisted. Tarika, who had been calling Champak, Gopi and Bablu to no avail, goes to a rented home, and starts enjoying the free-spirited London life while also trying to fund her education. Meanwhile, Champak and Gopi are referred to a fixer in Dubai, Tony, who gives them Pakistani aliases and forged passports. They return to London, under the names of Abdul Razzaq and Saqlain Mushtaq, and are briefly accosted by Naina, a cop. They find lodging in a house owned by Mrs. Kohli, who is Naina's estranged mother.\nWhen they meet Tarika, Champak is aghast at her lifestyle, and demands that she leave her lodgings or he will sever ties with her. Gopi asks him why he says so, to which he replies that this is in order to avoid getting caught by Naina. The two visit a police station, where Bablu is lodged; they pay for his bail, and he tells them that he is now penniless. One night, Mrs. Kohli has invited the Bansals for dinner on the eve of her birthday, when Naina suddenly barges in and says that since her mother has not cared for her, she can do whatever she wants. The next day, Champak and Gopi find the senior Kohli unconscious on the floor, and rush her to the hospital, narrowly saving her life. When Naina arrives on the scene, she breaks down and realises the value of caring for her.\nChampak, Gopi and Bablu hear of a fundraiser organised by Truford University and reluctantly agree to bid for its renovation, which costs 300,000 pounds. At their wits' end for arranging for such a large sum, they agree to sell the Ghasiteram family name. When Champak tells Tarika the news, she is nonplussed. The next day, as the three go to a scrapyard to collect the money, Champak pours his entire story to Tarika, who is convinced that she should not have put him and Gopi through so much trouble to fulfil her dream. Tarika later decides to give up her London scholarship and study back home in Udaipur, to which everyone agrees. The film ends with Champak and Gopi making peace over the Ghasiteram name.\n\nCast[edit]\nIrrfan Khan as Champak Ghasiteram Bansal\nRadhika Madan as Taarika \"Taaru\" Bansal\nMyrah Dandekar as Little Taarika\nDeepak Dobriyal as Gopi Ghasiteram Bansal\nKareena Kapoor Khan as Inspector Naina Kohli\nDimple Kapadia as Sampada Kohli\nRanvir Shorey as Bala \"Babloo\" Shankar Tripathi\nPankaj Tripathi as Travel Agent Tony Bansal\nKiku Sharda as Gajendra \"Gajju\" Ghasiteram Bansal\nManu Rishi as Bheluram Bansal\nZakir Hussain as Judge Indrabhan Chedda\nMeghna Malik as Principal Maalti Chedda\nManish Gandhi as Advait Raheja, Taarika's London friend\nTillotama Shome as College Consultant of Tarika\nPoorvi Jain as Rashi Bansal\nVipul Tank as Lagnesh\nAnkit Bisht as Anmol\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2017 in an interview after the success of his film Hindi Medium producer Dinesh Vijan told Mid-Day, \"There is definitely scope for a sequel.
