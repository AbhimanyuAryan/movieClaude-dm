He looks after his father Gurnam's dairy, but due to his raw mannerisms, he is unable to impress any girl proposed to his family for an arranged marriage. His friend Sukhi, a filmy buff, suggests that he should create a bad boy image to woe girls as shown in latest flicks. Both go on a bad boy drive, breaking many rules and giving rise to varying comical instances. Unknown to them, this is all recorded by a private detective Madhu Mangal Rane (Manoj Bajpayee), who is known to perform background checks on prospective grooms.\nWhen Suraj and his family meet the next prospective bride, her family shows them the photographs of his bad-boy drive and rejects his proposal. Gurnam (Manoj Pahwa) feels disgraced and leaves the house. Suraj then catches hold of Pandit Dubey (Neeraj Sood), who had earlier proposed this relation, and learns of Mangal's involvement. He decides to avenge the humiliation of his family and goes after Mangal.\nMangal belongs to a middle-class family and lives with his younger sister Tulshi (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and his mother Rekha (Supriya Pilgaonkar) in a chawl. Tulshi is considered the epitome of traditional girls with good moral values as per contemporary standards by one and all. Suraj and Sukhi first do a recce of Mangal's office in disguise, and then, late in the night, raid his office. Tulshi, who has just returned from her late-night tuitions, sees intruders in his office and enters to check out what is happening. Sukhi immediately runs away, but Suraj's coat gets stuck in the door. Their eyes meet for the first time and Suraj is immediately struck by her beauty. When her family and neighbours gather at the office, Mangal correctly suspects that Suraj has been here when he sees his photo and file missing from the office.\nTo avenge this nightly raid, Mangal mixes water in Suraj's milk cans the next day. Later, Suraj gets hold of a family photo featuring Mangal which they had earlier stolen from his office and learns that Tulshi is Mangal's sister. He chases her and they meet at a cosmetics store and they have a casual chat. Suraj had damaged her moped earlier, and he tells her that he would get it repaired. On this pretext, he drops her home and obtains her phone number. The next day he takes her on a date on the pretext of handing over her moped back. Tulshi also starts warming up to his romantic advances. Mangal meanwhile has found two suitors for her and most likely she would marry one of them. Tulshi reluctantly agrees with her brother as most traditional girls are expected to marry a suitor usually selected by someone elder in her family.\nAs their relation becomes stronger, Tulshi decides to reveal her profession to Suraj. She leads him and Sukhi to tuition class where she is supposed to teach, but exits from another door to a discotheque. Later they see her on stage in a fully modern avatar, completely contrary to her traditional personality, as a DJ. Suraj and Sukhi both enjoy her music, and Sukhi sees an opportunity for Suraj to get even with Mangal.\nThe next day the first suitor calls Mangal to reject his proposal after seeing Tulshi's DJ avatar in the newspaper. Mangal is thoroughly shocked and cannot come to terms that he was completely unaware of his sister's profession which is considered unacceptable in contemporary society and prohibits Tulshi from pursuing her DJ activity. She is deeply hurt by this and seeks solace with Suraj, whose confession pushes her into further grief. Suraj, with persistent efforts, is able to win back her trust. On the other side, Mangal comes to terms with his defeat and plans another act to get revenge. He meets Suraj's parents and proposes Tulshi's marriage with Suraj which everyone agrees to, despite Tulshi and Suraj doubting this sudden change of heart.\nOn the day of their engagement, Mangal tricks Gurnam into talking about dowry, which he records, and has the Dhillons arrested for dowry. Tulshi is heartbroken yet again as she cannot approve Suraj asking for dowry and resigns her fate to Mangal, who arranges her meeting with the second suitor he had spoken earlier and their marriage is fixed in haste.\nAfter seeking bail, Suraj discovers that Mangal is in a romantic relation with a woman, Kavya (Neha Pendse), who is married to a OCD-esque maths professor Chinmay Godbole (Vijay Raaz). Seeking revenge, Suraj produces evidence of adultery to Chinmay and asks him to press charges of adultery on Mangal, which he refuses because he hates the courts where nothing is in order. Suraj realises Kavya's plight and then tortures Chinmay by putting everything in sight out of order, forcing him to sign the divorce papers.\nOn the day of Tulshi's marriage, Kavya rushes to Mangal and tells him that Suraj made her husband sign the divorce papers. Mangal, who was unsure of the match from the beginning, realises his mistake and apologies to Tulshi and Rekha, and they flee from the marriage. They go to the railway station where Suraj is returning with his parents to their native place forever to escape from the humiliation of their dowry charges. Out of desperation, Mangal pulls the emergency chain to stop it and searches for Suraj. He is able to finally reunite Tulshi and Suraj, but the TTE charges him for stopping the train. As Mangal has forgotten to carry his wallet, he is unable to pay the fine; when the Dhillons refuse as well, Mangal is sent to jail.\n\nCast[edit]\nManoj Bajpayee as Detective Madhu Mangal Rane\nDiljit Dosanjh as Suraj Singh Dhillon\nFatima Sana Shaikh as Tulsi Rane aka Tina\nAnnu Kapoor as Shantaram Kaka\nSupriya Pilgaonkar as Rekha Rane\nVijay Raaz as Chinmay Godbole\nSeema Pahwa as Yeshodha Dhillon\nManoj Pahwa as Gurnam Singh Dhillon\nNeeraj Sood as Pandit Dubey Ji\nNeha Pendse as Kavya Godbole\nAbhishek Banerjee as Dinesh\nUjjwal Gauraha as DJ Chetas\nKarishma Tanna in a special appearance in the song \"Basanti\"\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nMumbai Mirror wrote,\" If you\u2019re in the market for a feature film that doesn\u2019t employ your brains too much but leaves you largely satisfied, this one won\u2019t disappoint.\"[6]\nTimes Now says, \" \u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0939\u093e \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0924\u094b \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u0938\u0942\u0930\u091c \u092a\u0947 \u092e\u0902\u0917\u0932 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u090f\u0915 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u092a\u0932 \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u091c\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0947 \u0906\u092a \u0906\u0930\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0941\u0915\u0942\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902.\"[7]\nBox Office Worldwide wrote, \"Though Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari was set in the 90s it was quite confusing at times. The characters don\u2019t look like they are in the 90s mostly because of their appearance. The makers tried to do some political satire which is decent. SPMB is one such film that we can enjoy with the entire family.\"[8]\nCinestaan wrote, \"The love angle between Suraj and Tulshi, an important pillar of the story, turns out to be the only major weak link since the two fall in love in a jiffy. Of all the creative liberties taken here, this is one that you find most hard to accept. But with the negatives vastly outnumbered by the positives, the end result is an ideal Diwali entertainer. Go for it, but without forsaking safety.\"[9]\nTimes of India reporter Pallabi Dey Purkayastha wrote,\" Suraj Pe Mangal Bhaari\u2019 is a witty satire \u2013 on the gori-kaali hangover, what qualifies as good or bad behaviour in today\u2019s world and how little soothsayers know about marriages.\"[10]\nThe Hindu entertainment journalist wrote, \" Perhaps, it is time that film industries in India woke up to the fact that COVID-19 has brought in the acceptance among audiences on the type of films that deserves to be watched on the big screen. The ones that bet on witty dialogues and entertainingly sketched scenes for success can very well stand the test of time even if they are viewed on a mobile screen.\"[11]\nIndia Today entertainment editor wrote, \" Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari offers some genuine laughs and some equally genuine performances by a stellar cast.\"[12]\nDNA India entertainment editor said, \"Go watch it in theatres and take your family along. You won't be disappointed. Also, wait for the credit scenes, for they will keep you longing for more.\"[13]\nAnna MM Vetticad from First Post said,\" Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari is funny \u2013 very funny \u2013 up to a point. It is also intermittently political, inconsistent and not half as sharp as it set out to be.\"[14]\nBollywood Hungama says,\"Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari is a decent entertainer and a clean family film that works because of its plot, the depiction of the mid-90s era and the performances.\"[15]\nZee News wrote, \" Full to Dhamal, this movie will give feel good experience to audience. This is a gift for movie lovers.\"[16]\nKhaleej Times entertainment news editor wrote, \"If it\u2019s laughs you are looking out for then Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari is bound to give you a rollicking time at the cinemas.\"[17]\nMagzter says, \"Barring a few glitches, Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari offers a different take on situational comedy. See it for the performances and for Diljit and Manoj's comic timing. The film's climax is a send-off to the iconic railway scene of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.\".[18]\nWhizbliz, \"What a come back of Bollywood in Cinemas with Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari. The movie is simply fun to watch and filled with a lot of surprising elements!!!\"[19]\nSpotboyE, \"Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari Is Fun While It Lasts.
