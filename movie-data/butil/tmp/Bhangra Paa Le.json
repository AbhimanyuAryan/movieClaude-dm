He continues to perform Bhangra after being recruited in the army. On the battlefield as well, he motivates his comrades to get up by beating a drum and performing Bhangra. Unfortunately, Kaptaan loses a leg in the war, and feels dejected and refuses to go home. Back home, Nimmo, the girl he loves, is about to get married.\nKaptaan had met Nimmo at a neighbouring wedding and wooed her family by performing Bhangra in the duel. Her brothers order Kaptaan to come ask for Nimmo's hand after the war, but as he fails to come, they arrange her alliance elsewhere.\nIn the camp, Kaptaan's comrades cheer him up by beating the drum, and motivate him to return home. He goes to Nimmo's house in the middle of her wedding preparations, and dances on one leg to woo her family again. Nimmo enters with the drum and provides him with support, and the family agrees to their wedding.\nIn the present, Jaggi Singh is a Bhangra aspirant from Khalsa college who wants Bhangra to make it big in the world. Kaptaan is Jaggi's idol, and he believes that in order to perform the main move in Bhangra, the \"jhoomar\", one has to be in love. He meets Simi Kohli in a wedding and they immediately hit it off. Later, they find out they are from rival colleges Khalsa and GNDU, in the international Bhangra competition, and part ways. Both teams get through the semi-finals, and Jaggi and Simi come closer. Simi falls in love, and dances her heart out in the qualifier round, which leads to GNDU winning the ticket to the finals in London. The qualifier round results lead to a crowd clash between the two teams, and Jaggi gets injured in the leg while trying to break off the fights. Upset, Jaggi then ignores Simi, breaks it off with his team, and returns to his village, where he eventually reunites with the village Bhangra group, Pendu Club, run by his father.\nPendu Club starts making dance videos and enters the competition in London through crowdfunding.\nBoth GNDU and Pendu Club are able to clear the semi-final rounds. Jaggi and Simi meet again, and spend time together near the London Eye. He tells her about Kaptaan and Nimmo, and she tells him about her father who had abandoned her, who she recently met in London. They grow closer.\nLater, in the final round, Jaggi finds his leg collapsing. Simi enters in the wings with a drum, motivating Jaggi to keep dancing. He also performs \"jhoomar\" with the same energy now, and Pendu Club wins the competition. Simi and Jaggi finally unite as lovers.\n\nCast[edit]\nSunny Kaushal as Jaggi and Kaptaan Singh\nRukshar Dhillon as Simi Kohli\nShriya Pilgaonkar as Nimmo\nSwasti Kapur as Kiran\nSarthak Kakar as Pappi\nParmeet Sethi as Jaggi's father\nJayati Bhatia as Jaggi's mother\nSamir Soni as Simi's father\nSheeba Chaddha as Geeta Kohli, Simi's mother\nMahavir Bhullar as Kaptaan's father\nSeema Kaushal as Kaptaan's mother\nKamlesh Gill as Nimmo's grandmother\nNaila Grewal as Heer\nVarun Narang as Bhangra competition judge\nMark Bennington as Henderson\nSunit Razdan as Subedar Karim\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was scheduled to be released theatrically on 1 November 2019, but got delayed, and finally released in India on 3 January 2020.[1] The film was later released on Netflix on 1 March 2020.[8]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nBhangra Paa LeSoundtrack album by JAM8, Rishi Rich, Yash Narvekar and A BazzReleased16 December 2019[9]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength38:43LanguageHindiLabelTips MusicExternal audio Official Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThe music of the film is composed by Shubham Shirule, Keeran, \nAakashdeep Sengupta, Kaushik - Aakash - Guddu (KAG), Ana Rehman, Nilotpal Munshi, Kiranee for JAM8, Rishi Rich, Yash Narvekar and A Bazz with lyrics written by Shloke Lal, Kiranee, Shubham Shirule for JAM8, Siddhant Kaushal, Mandy Gill, Raftaar, Yash Narvekar, Manisha and A Bazz.
