The film stars Kartik Aaryan and Alaya F.[1] Filming started in August 2021 and wrapped in September 2021.[2] The film premiered 2 December 2022 on Disney+Hotstar.[3]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nDr. Freddy Ginwala is a shy and socially awkward dentist in Mumbai. He goes on multiple dates with women, only to get rejected every time. His only friend is his pet tortoise, Hardy, and he also spends his leisure time working on his miniature planes. When he was a child, his father killed his mother and then committed suicide. His aunt, Persis, has been his guardian since then.\nAt a relative's wedding, Freddy sees a girl named Kainaaz and awkwardly approaches her to talk to her, but is pushed away by her husband, Rustom, who was handling the catering for the wedding. Kainaaz meets Freddy at his clinic the next day, saying she wants to extract her wisdom tooth, and he carries out the surgery the next day. Freddy soon falls in love with her and cannot stop thinking about her. He goes near her house to catch a glimpse of her and sees her being beaten by Rustom. Freddy calls her the next day, insisting she visit him so that he can check if she is healing properly post-surgery. He questions her about the wounds on her face, and she reveals that Rustom is abusive towards her and would kill her if she ever leaves him. They start dating secretly, and she reciprocates his feelings. They plan to get married and get rid of Rustom by killing him.\nFreddy kills him by running him over with his car and goes straight to his farmhouse in Karjat and stays there for a week, also getting the damage inflicted upon the vehicle repaired. The police cannot find any evidence related to Rustom's death. On returning, Freddy meets Kainaaz at her home but is shocked to see her with Raymond, a chef. Kainaaz reveals to Freddy that she never loved him and only used him to get her husband killed so that she and Raymond could be together and become the owners of the restaurant previously owned by her husband. Freddy is devastated and decides to seek revenge. He sneaks into Kainaaz's house and replaces her facewash with liquid dishwasher detergent, as Kainaaz had previously mentioned being allergic to sodium sulfate. He also removes the brake fluid from Raymond's car. Kainaaz wakes up to find her skin covered in rashes due to the allergy. Raymond drives her to the hospital, but due to the brakes being faulty, they suffer an accident and are injured.\nThe next day, they find that someone has posted an online review of her restaurant, complaining of a lizard being found in the food, tarnishing its reputation. An obscene photo of them has also been leaked online. Kainaaz is convinced that Freddy is behind all this. They go to his house and beat him, but the police arrive there, as Freddy had informed them beforehand. They reveal to the police that Freddy had killed Rustom but cannot provide any proof, as Freddy had sneaked into Kainaaz's house and secretly deleted all his photos and messages from their phones while they were asleep. They later break into Freddy's house while he is away and kill Hardy, leaving him heartbroken. An eyewitness to Rustom's murder reveals Freddy's car number to the police, though he had not seen the driver's face. When the police come to interrogate Freddy, he lies that in order to frame him, Raymond had taken his car to kill Rustom and proves it by showing false messages that he had himself secretly sent from Kainaaz's phone to his phone and the CCTV footage of them breaking into his house.\nFreddy calls Kainaaz and Raymond and says that the police will be coming for them and that he will spare them if they come and apologize to him at his farmhouse. He also asks them to bring a suitcase along with them. The police see the CCTV footage of them leaving the house with the suitcase and assume they have absconded. At the farmhouse, they attempt to kill Freddy, but he overpowers and captures them. He then violently extracts both of their teeth without anesthesia, which results in their deaths. As Freddy buries Kainaaz (who was miraculously still alive after the teeth extraction), he tells her a final joke, saying he \"still loves her.\" He lies down between the two buried bodies and smiles creepily at the audience as the screen goes black.\n\nCast[edit]\nKartik Aaryan as Dr. Freddy Ginwala: An introvert Dentist\nAlaya F as Kainaaz Cruz Irani: Rustom's wife\nKaran A.

Watch out for Kartik\u2019s unusual performance\".[21] Eshita Bhargava of The Financial Express rated the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote \"From the screenplay and cinematography to the direction and acting, Freddy is a must-watch. Kartik Aaryan has once again given us an excellent performance, proving that he can play any character and cannot be stereotyped\".[22] Pragya Jha of ABP News rated the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote \"After watching this movie, one can say that there has been a welcome shift in recent Hindi films toward crime thrillers. Watch this film to see Kartik Aaryan in a whole new light!\".[23] Chirag Sehgal of News 18 rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Freddy is worth watching. You\u2019ll enjoy the curiosity that the film invokes. You will surely like Kartik Aaryan in an entirely new avatar. Alaya F is the cherry on the cake. By the end of the film, you might fear visiting a dentist ever again, but that\u2019s the fun!\".[24] Ankita Bhandari of Zee News rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and praised the suspense drama for \"Kartik's brilliant acting, gripping tale, edgy plot, amazing direction and unpredictable climax!\".[25] Mehak Sabharwal of Zoom rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and termed the film as \"good watch\" and wrote, You get to see a new version of Kartik, which is very different from the films he has done before. The film deserves your time.[26]\nRenuka Vyavahare of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Freddy is fairly engaging and unsettling but it wavers to go all out. The film starts off well but doesn\u2019t reach its full potential\".[27] Tushar Joshi of India Today rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Freddy is dark and twisted. Watch it if you want to take a break from the candy floss version of Kartik Aaryan and see him attempt something different\".[28] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The film is a slow burner for sure. A lot of time is spent building up Freddy\u2019s character. He\u2019s shown to be most comfortable around his tools, losing himself in his job and earning the trust of his patients\".[29] Avinash Lohana of Pinkvilla rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Freddy rides on performances and the gripping second half of the movie\".[30] Umesh Punwani of Koimoi rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"From \u2018Pyaar Ka Punchnama\u2019 To \u2018Nafrat Ka Punchnama\u2019, Kartik Aaryan masters the art of balancing being an actor & a star.\"[31]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"\"A film that's been close to my heart, long before it began\"-Kartik Aaryan shares his excitement for Freddy\".
