The film is directed by Kanwal Sethi and produced by Mohit Chhabra and Ajay Rai. It is created by S. Hussain Zaidi and stars Mouni Roy and Purab Kohli. The film is about R&AW agents in London investigating China's role in the pandemic with a ruthless mole in their midst.[1][2] A Sequel titled Lahore Confidential was released on ZEE5 in 2021.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nR&AW officials stationed in London have gathered strong evidence through their sources which indicate the involvement of Chinese Communist party in the spread of the virus and are very close to getting the final evidence. However, Chinese authorities get wind of this through a mole in the Indian embassy. In order to have a low-key presence the R&AW uses a grocery store as their outpost to execute and coordinate operations.[3][4]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nMouni Roy as Uma Kulkarni\nPurab Kohli as Arjun Manish Kumar\nKulraj Randhawa as Nirupama Das\nSagar Arya as Sharad\nParvesh Rana as Azaad\nJas Binag as Jeevan\nDiljohn Singh as Biren Ghosh\nKiren jogi as Mrs Anju Mehta\nRoxane Cabassut as Angelie\nLaura fontamara as Dancer girl\nDandan Liu as Yuki\nMohan Kapoor as RK Goyal, Jt. Secretary\nSharad Kelkar as Tanmay Kulkarni (Cameo)\nRelease[edit]\nLondon Confidential was premiered on ZEE5 on 18 September 2020.[5]\n\nReception[edit]\nSamrudhi Ghosh from Hindustan Times stated, \u201cLondon Confidential is a crisp espionage thriller, at one hour and 14 minutes, but the trite and predictable climax does not live up to the interesting premise.[6] India Today stated, \u201cThe screenplay is gripping and Kanwal Sethi\u2019s direction does justice to it. The cinematography captures the London cityscape in an interesting hue. The editing is crisp and has ensured there are no dull moments in the film. All-in-all, \u2018London Confidential\u2019 is worth the full 1 hour and 17 minutes of your time\u201d.[citation needed] Scroll.in mentioned, \u201cThe film is based on a concept by tireless conspiracy thriller churner S Hussain Zaidi. Written by Akshay Singh and Prateek Payodhi and directed by Kanwal Sethi, London Confidential doesn\u2019t indulge in much Chinese-bashing. The focus is on sending Uma and Arjun on a wild-goose chase before they stumble upon the truth that is staring them in the face.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Farzeen, Sana (25 August 2020). \"Purab Kohli and Mouni Roy starrer London Confidential to stream on ZEE5\".
