In 1998, Dhanush Sawant aka Dodo (Divyenndu), Pratik Garodia aka Pinku (Pratik Gandhi) and Ayush Gupta (Avinash Tiwary) of Mumbai are in Class 10 and they dream of going to Goa after their board examinations. Due to their parents' reluctance, they are unable to do so. In 2003, they once again plan the trip after their graduation. Sadly, the car meets with the accident as soon as they begin their journey. The plan is yet again put on the backburner. A few years later, Pinku moves to Cape Town while Ayush migrates to New York. Both succeed in life and their pay package also increases. Meanwhile, Dodo is not able to have a steady job. He keeps in touch with Pinku and Ayush on social media and sees that they have become stinking rich. Hence, Dodo uses Photoshop to paint a false picture that he resides in a penthouse and is having the time of his life. In 2015, Pinku and Ayush decide to fly down to Mumbai. They inform Dodo about it and also tell him that they'll stay at his 'penthouse'! Dodo obviously gets tense and hence, he suggests that as soon as they land, the three of them should fulfil their plan of going to Goa. Pinku and Ayush agree. Since Dodo can't afford expensive flight tickets, he books three tickets in Madgaon Express under the pretext that they should travel like they would have, had they gone to the beach state in 2003! Pinku and Ayush hate the idea but give in. Sadly, for them, things go wrong even before they board the train and soon, they find themselves being confronted by dangerous criminals like Kanchan Kombdi (Chhaya Kadam) and Mendonza Bhai (Upendra Limaye). What happens next forms the rest of the film.\n\nCast[edit]\nDivyenndu as Dhanush (Dodo) Sawant\nPratik Gandhi as Pratik (Pinku) Goradia\nAvinash Tiwary as Ayush Gupta\nNora Fatehi as Tasha\nKunal Khemu as drug peddler (Cameo appearance)\nRemo D'Souza as Dr Danny (Special appearance)\nUpendra Limaye as Mendoza Bhai\nChhaya Kadam as Kanchan Kombdi\nUmesh Jagtap as Constable Santosh Sathe\nRaviraj Kande as Ganpat\nSameer Patil as Dodo\u2019s father\nVipul Deshpande as Police inspector\nJewel Narigara as Young Pinku\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced in August 2022[7] and wrapped in February 2023.[8]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMadgaon ExpressSoundtrack album by Sharib-Toshi Ankur Tewari, Kunal Khemu, Sagar Desai, Sameer Uddin and Ajay\u2013AtulReleased13 March 2024[9]Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength20:20LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioMadgaon Express - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Sharib-Toshi, Ankur Tewari, Kunal Khemu, Sagar Desai, Sameer Uddin and Ajay\u2013Atul.

The film is deliriously funny as it moves effortlessly and incessantly between slapstick and sparkling silver-tongued wit.\"[16]\nShubhra Gupta od The Indian Express gave 1.5 stars out of 5 and stated that \u00a0Too many of the jokes end in a clunk. A song line about not having fun attempts to spice up a scene when the bad guys are sleeping and the good men are trying to get away. That may have served as a summary of the entire movie.[17]\nDhaval Roy of The Times of India gave 3.5 stars and said in his review that \"With its sharp dialogue and spot-on performances, Madgaon Express is a comedy worth watching. The mad ride will leave you laughing out loud!\"[18]\nRahul Desai of the Film Companion writes in his review that \"Kunal Kemmu\u2019s directorial debut sparkle with hat-tip to a legion of buddy movies, from The Hangover to Dil Chahta Hai.\"[19]\nSana Farzeen of India Today gave 4/5 stars and stated that \"Overall, 'Madgaon Express' is a much-needed escape from all the heavy-duty actioners, biopics, and even films with a social message. It reminds you of simpler times when movies were all about having a fun time with your families and friends at the theatre. So, grab that box of popcorn and get on board for a side-splitting, crazy ride.\"[20]\nPratikshya Mishra of The Quint praises the film and said that \" It has been a while since Bollywood delivered the kind of buddy comedy we deserve and it is almost fate that Kunal Kemmu would bring it back to the screens with Madgaon Express.\"\"[21]\nLachmi Deb Roy of the Firstpost writes in the review of film that \"Madgaon Express is a funny ride filled with laughter. This is a movie which will entertain you to the fullest.\"[22]\nRajiv Vijayakar from Koimoi rated the film 3.5/5 stars and mentioned that \"I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed this voyage into a vacation that was an anti-climax for the heroes but goofily entertaining for viewers\".[23]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Madgaon Express (15)\".
