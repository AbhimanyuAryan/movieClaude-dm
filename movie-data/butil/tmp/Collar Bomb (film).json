As he races against time, he's confronted by an evil that is hell-bent on striking raw, primal terror.\n\nCast[edit]\nJimmy Sheirgill as SHO Manoj Hesi\nSparsh Srivastav as Shoeb Ali\nRajshri Deshpande as Rita\nAsha Negi as ASI Sumitra Joshi\nAjit Singh Palawat as Ratan Negi\nNaman Jain as Akshay Hesi\nAjay Purkar as Commander Bhaskar Chandra\nShashi Bhushan as Inspector Mohan Rawat\nAmbarish Deshpande as Deputy Commandant Satyan\nVidushi Mehra as Sarah Fernandes\nSuman Singh as Peter Fernandes\nShantanu Bhamare\nReception[edit]\nJyoti Kanyal of India Today gave the film a negative review and stating, \"Dnyanesh Zoting's Collar Bomb is a disappointing thriller, which is devoid of logic and depth. Watch it if you don't have much else to do.\"[3] Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film 1.75 out of 5 stars and expressing, \"Will the Nikhil Nair who wrote her with such finesse and the Dnyanesh Zoting who directed her with such confidence please raise their hands and tell us what went wrong with the rest of Collar Bomb?\"[4] Archika Khurana of Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"As Jimmy Sheirgill says in the end, \u201cLife is a chain that is built from the decisions we make.\u201d This perfectly summing up this 87-minute riveting drama. It will have you hooked to your seat the entire time.\"[5]\nPankaj Shukla of Amar Ujala gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"The film is fine for passing the time on weekends but its director Dnyanesh Zoting has raised a hope that if given a chance, he will definitely do a big bang.\"[6]  Russel D'Silva of BollywoodLife gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated, \"Collar Bomb is a quite a taut, tight thriller for three quarters of the way until the final quarter ergo the climax almost brings everything crashing down. Thankfully, Jimmy Sheirgill and surprise package Asha Negi prevent the movie from ending with too sour an aftertaste.\"[7] Madhuri V of Filmibeat gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"The cop thriller keeps you majorly hooked until you foresee the climax from a distance. Later, when the big reveal is made, it simply fails to make a loud blast.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jain, Vaishali (14 July 2021). \"Jimmy Shergill on shooting 'Collar Bomb' during pandemic: 'We didn't let our guard down'\". www.indiatvnews.com.
