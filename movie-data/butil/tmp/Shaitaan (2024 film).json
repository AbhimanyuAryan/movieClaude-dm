(March 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nKabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with their kids Janhvi and Dhruv. They schedule a vacation at their farmhouse in a remote hill station. Midway, they stop by a roadside eatery and acquaint themselves with an enigmatic mid-aged man, who introduces himself as Vanraj Kashyap. Janhvi undergoes an incomprehensible change after gulping down a Laddu given by Vanraj and craves to do everything he asks for. Before they depart, Vanraj gives Janhvi a packet of biscuits to eat after reaching the farmhouse and she takes them before joining her family at the swimming pool.\nSubsequently, Vanraj inexplicably arrives at the farmhouse and citing that his phone's battery has died, he asks them to let him stay over till it gets charged. Though Kabir agrees, Jyoti remains suspicious. Vanraj and Janhvi engage in a conversation and she discloses about her boyfriend when Dhruv interrupts and insists on playing with Janhvi; Vanraj instructs her to frighten him. Janhvi gets on a swing with her brother and swings swiftly, petrifying Dhruv. Kabir and Jyoti reprimand Janhvi for her mischievous deed while Vanraj interferes too much in their personal discussion, infuriating Kabir, who tells him to leave. When Vanraj vehemently refuses, Kabir starts dragging him out but Janhvi, upon being asked by Vanraj to resist her father, stops Kabir violently and declares that Vanraj will not go anywhere; she even breaks up with her boyfriend at Vanraj's behest, stunning her parents. Vanraj reveals to Kabir and Jyoti that he has hypnotised Janhvi through black magic and states that she will obey every command of his and asks them to give her away to him. When they deny, Vanraj dictates Janhvi to laugh, then cry, to break all the mobile phones, eat teapowder, slap Kabir and bang her brother's head on the staircase; she complies to all the instructions, leaving Kabir and Jyoti shattered.\nHaving received a phone call from Jyoti through a cellphone she has kept hidden, two police officials arrive at the farmhouse to check upon the family. Vanraj instructs Janhvi to explode the gas cylinder in the kitchen if her parents disclose the truth to the police, prompting Kabir and Jyoti to cover it up in the police's presence. They hide Dhruv, who is profusely bleeding, in the bedroom and lie to the police that the phone calls were made to them by Dhruv for fun. The police leave upon corroborating no suspicious activity. Kabir offers to give all the money he has to Vanraj in exchange for sparing Janhvi and he agrees; after Vanraj exits with the money, Kabir and Jyoti realize that he hasn't yet freed Janhvi from the spell and rush outdoors to see him setting the money on fire. Declaring that he is not submissive to materialistic things and aims to achieve something superior. He reenters their farmhouse and orders Janhvi to slap herself and then to dance continuously. He instructs her to slit Jyoti's throat with a knife when she tries to comfort her, prompting her to back off. He goes to sleep, commanding Janhvi to guard him. Janhvi involuntarily urinates in her shorts and Jyoti abundantly pleads with Vanraj to let her clean Janhvi up and change her pants but Vanraj orders her to do the latter only.\nKabir and Jyoti manage to subdue Janhvi and pounce on Vanraj but the latter orders Janhvi to keep laughing and threatens Kabir that even if he is killed, Janhvi will keep on laughing till she dies. This compels Kabir to spare him but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill Dhruv. She goes after Dhruv and repels her parents' attempts in desisting her and throws him off the terrace, almost fatally wounding him. Vanraj then pressurises Kabir and Jyoti to give Janhvi away and takes her away; unbeknownst to him, Kabir follows them to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone's settings while Jyoti takes Dhruv to a hospital. Vanraj has kept 100 other girls in his lair and prepares to sacrifice them by making them jump into a huge pyre to acquire something superhuman. Kabir intrudes on the ritual, cuts Vanraj's tongue off and throws it into the pyre; when the girls try to assault him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's words to them, in which he declares their freedom, which is actually uttered in another context. Thus, all the girls escape Vanraj's control and return to their normal selves. Kabir's family reconciles at the hospital. All the other girls safely head to their homes with the police's help. The police assure Kabir that they'll catch Vanraj soon, but he's still running.\nA year later, Kabir heads to an isolated place where he has held Vanraj captive. He tells Vanraj that a father can go to any extent to protect his family and exits the place, ignoring Vanraj's plea, who can no longer speak.\n\nCast[edit]\nAjay Devgn as Kabir Rishi\nJyothika as Jyoti Rishi, Kabir's wife\nR.

It\u2019s  a poorly made remake and the story is just not believable. Making the hero win at the end makes the film just too predictable\".[19] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 1.5/5 and wrote \"Jyothika is the only one in the cast who is able to rise a bit above the sheer absurdity of the proceedings. The two male characters and the actors playing them don't stand a chance\".[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"CBFC grants U/A certificate to Ajay Devgn-starrer Shaitaan while the original version Vash was passed with an 'A' certificate, that too with 8 cuts\".
