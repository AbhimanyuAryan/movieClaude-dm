It employed virtual production technology for a scene set in London.\nOriginally planned for a release on 30 July 2021, it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Radhe Shyam was theatrically released on 11 March 2022 and received mixed reviews from critics, praising music, direction and production values, but criticised its screenplay and narration. The film grossed \u20b9250 crore (US$31\u00a0million) \u2013 \u20b9300 crore (US$38\u00a0million)  worldwide to become the second highest-grossing Telugu film of the year.[b]\nThe film also marked Tollywood actor, Rebel Star Krishnam Raju\u2018s last Telugu film before his death in September.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1978 Italy, Vikramaditya aka Aditya is a young world-renowned astrologer. After having read the palm of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and mentioned about The Emergency (India), he runs to Rome. Dubbed as the \"Einstein of palmistry,\" he is a disciple of the saint Paramahamsa. Aditya does not believe in romantic relationships, but instantly falls for Dr. Prerana, a gorgeous and clumsy young doctor. They meet on a train but separate thereafter. One day, Vikramaditya reads the palm of Anand Rajput, an aspiring politician and businessman. When Aditya predicts that Rajput cannot be a politician, Rajput's men chase him which results in him having an accident. He is admitted into the hospital where Prerana works and is treated there. After recovering, Aditya proposes to Prerana to be in a flirtationship with him. Prerana, however feels insulted and leaves town but Aditya follows her all the way. She accepts his proposal and they begin to date. Prerana's uncle, Dean Chakravarthy, however, asks her not to develop any deep feelings toward Aditya.\nWhen Aditya and Prerana are traveling on a train, a stranger requests him to read the palm of his daughter, Tara, an aspiring archer. He predicts that she does not have any future in sports, and she should instead focus on education. Amazed by Aditya's skill, everyone in the coach ask for predictions by showing their palm but Aditya hesitantly gets down along with Prerana. However, he realizes that everyone on the train is destined for immediate death. He chases the train to stop it but in vain. Later that evening, the train meets an accident, leading to several casualties. Prerana, who starts to believe in palmistry, asks Aditya to read her palm. He predicts that she would have a long life with a bright future but she faints immediately with a bleeding nose. Prerana is admitted to the hospital where her uncle, who is also a doctor, reveals that she is suffering from an incurable tumor and may die within months. Aditya disagrees since he predicted otherwise but is expelled from the hospital.\nPrerana is now hopeful of her life. Her uncle, on the other hand, believes Aditya is a fraud and that only medicine can change her fate. He tests Aditya with five dead people's palms, and Aditya deduces all of them correctly. Her uncle changes his mind and trusts Aditya's prediction. When a cure for Prerana's disease is found, an elated Prerana proposes to Aditya. However, he rejects her by saying he cannot love her as he does not possess a \"love line\" and would be leaving the country soon. Dejected, Prerana attempts suicide but comes across Aditya's diary. She learns that Aditya was prepared to sacrifice his life to save her. Before leaving, Aditya takes Prerana to a ballroom dance as per her wish and the couple spends the night intimately. Prerana leaves a note in the diary that she'd choose to give up her life instead when such situation arises. She willingly meets a car accident and is admitted to the hospital.\nAditya, who is in London for his mother's dance show, reads Prerana's note in the diary. He calls the hospital and is shocked to know the condition of Prerana. He urges Prerana to live, promising to meet her soon. When Aditya is in a dilemma about his prediction, he comes across Tara who has lost her hand in the accident. She tells Aditya that since she does not have a palm now, she can write her destiny. Aditya, who is now in hurry to meet Prerana, boards a cargo ship to Italy which is captained by a person he met in the hospital. However, the ship is caught by a storm in the sea and everyone abandons the ship on the captain's orders. Aditya, however, is trapped on the ship alone. Overwhelmed by the force of nature, Aditya struggles to survive. He recalls his guru Paramahamsa's assertion that palmistry is only 99% accurate, and there are 1% of the people script their own destiny. Determined to survive, he uses all his strength to reach a high point and fires a flare gun. The captain returns with a lifeboat. The ship sinks but the drowned Aditya remains afloat. Later, Aditya arrives at the hospital and reunites with the recovered Prerana. Aditya proposes to Prerana and she accepts. The film ends with Tara winning in paralympic archery and Aditya and Prerana's marriage.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nPrabhas as Vikramaditya \"Aditya\"\nPooja Hegde as Dr. Prerana Chakravarthy\nKrishnam Raju as Paramahamsa (in Telugu)[c]\nSathyaraj as Paramahamsa (in Hindi)\nBhagyashree as Girija Rani\nKunaal Roy Kapur as Vedant\nSachin Khedekar as Dean Dev Chakravarthy\nPriyadarshi as Subbarao\nMurali Sharma as Jagat Chakravarthy\nRiddhi Kumar as Tara\nSathyan as Anand Rajput's assistant\nBeena Banerjee as Prerana's grandmother\nAnuradha Patel as Madhuri\nFlora Jacob as Indira Gandhi\nSasha Chettri as Nithya\nSurya as a scientist (in Telugu)\nThalaivasal Vijay as a scientist (in Hindi)\nSpecial appearances\n\nJagapathi Babu as Anand Rajput\nJayaram as the ship captain\nNarrator\n\nAmitabh Bachchan (in Hindi)\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nRadhe Shyam was originally conceived by director Chandra Sekhar Yeleti. He worked with his assistant Radha Krishna Kumar to develop the story but the idea was dropped after they failed to give it a conclusion. Kumar borrowed the storyline from Yeleti, and worked on it for eighteen years to give the story a satisfactory ending. He narrated the script to actor Prabhas while he was shooting for the Baahubali series (2015\u201317). Prabhas liked the script and signed up for the project.[11][12]\nKumar initially wanted to set the story in the backdrop of a hill station in India. However, the story was moved to Europe following Prabhas' suggestion.[11] Radha Krishna Kumar revealed that the protagonist Vikramaditya's character is inspired by real life European palmist Cheiro.[13] Several titles including Jaan and O Dear were considered for the film but the makers finalized Radhe Shyam as the film's title.[14]\nThe film was formally launched on 5 September 2018 in Hyderabad, tentatively titled as Prabhas 20. Pooja Hegde was cast opposite Prabhas.[15] Hegde called the film a \"fresh and mature love story\".[16] Veteran actress Bhagyashree is cast in a crucial role in the film.[17] The film is a romantic drama set in 1970's Europe.[18]\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe film is shot simultaneously in Telugu and Hindi languages.[19][20] Principal photography commenced on 6 October 2018.[21] Filming took place in Hyderabad, Turin (Italy) and Georgia, after which it was suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.[22] Filming resumed in Italy in October 2020.[23] In December 2020, several scenes were shot at the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad.[24] Final schedule of the film began on 25 June 2021 in Hyderabad.[25][26][27] While much of the film was shot on location in London, a particular scene featuring Prabhas in London was shot in India using virtual production technology.[28] Filming was completed on 28 July 2021.[29]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Radhe Shyam (soundtrack)\nThe film has distinct Hindi and Telugu albums.[30] The Hindi soundtrack is composed by Mithoon and Manan Bhardwaj while Justin Prabhakaran is composing the songs in the Telugu version (in addition to Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam versions).

The VFX deserves an applause, and adds to the visual quality of the film.\"[49] Janani K of India Today gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Prabhas and Pooja Hegde's Radhe Shyam has great potential in its premise. However, apart from brilliant visuals and production design, the film lacks soul\".[50] A reviewer from Pinkvilla gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Prabhas is sincere in some scenes but looks demotivated when the writing fails him. Thaman's background music lacks novelty.\"[51]\nA Deccan Chronicle critic gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Perhaps better and stronger writing could have taken Radhe Shyam to a different level.\"[52] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 2/5 and wrote \"Prabhas and Pooja Hegde are saddled with a screenplay that allows them little room for manoeuvre. The end result is calamitous.\"[53] Siby Jeyya of India Herald gave the film a rating of 2/5 and wrote \"The first half of the film is artistically and visually stunning. The second period is slow and complex on the surdata-face. Even though the film isn't genuinely bad, it still felt like wasting our money and time.\"[54] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 1/5 and wrote \"Prabhas-starrer expects us to swallow, hook, line and so many sinkers, and we are constantly collecting our jaws off the floor.\"[55]\nSangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu stated \"A shallow story and lacklustre screenplay make Radhe Shyam a colossal bore.\"[56] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times stated \"Prabhas and Pooja Hegde's film is packed with romance, songs, VFX, grand outdoors but not a lot of logic or good writing.\"[57] Sonil Dedhia of News18 stated \"The Prabhas and Pooja Hegde starrer ends up as one of those big budget attempts that's highly ambitious and silly at the same time.\"[58]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAccording to the makers, the film had a total worldwide gross of \u20b979 crore on its opening day.[59] On the second day the film had a worldwide gross of \u20b940 crore making the worldwide gross of 2 days to \u20b9119 crore.[60] On the third day the film had a worldwide gross of \u20b932 crore making the opening weekend collection \u20b9151 crore gross.[61] IB Times stated \"Among the overseas centres, Radhe Shyam did well at the US box office where it minted Rs 13.8 crore with a distributors' share of Rs 6.9 crore in the three-day first weekend\".[62]\nAs of 14\u00a0March\u00a02022[update], the film had a total worldwide gross of \u20b9165.18 crore.[63] Jatinder Singh of Pinkvilla wrote that \"The film is a big disaster at the box office as the film netted \u20b999.50 crore from 4 days in India and it is even difficult for the film to reach even \u20b9125 crore\".[64] The makers claimed that the film grossed \u20b9200 crore at the box office in 10 days, however, The Indian Express reported, \"the other estimates put the film's worldwide collection so far well below the Rs 150 crore mark.\"[65] The film had a huge dip in its collections on its first Monday with \u20b91.5 crore (nett).[66]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The Indian Express, and Outlook reported it to be \u20b9300 crore.[2][3] India Today, News 18 and The Times of India said that the budget was \u20b9350 crore.[4][5][6]\n\n^ a b News18 said that the collection was \u20b9200 crore.[7] The Times of India and India Today said that the collection was \u20b9214 crore.[8][9]\n\n^ Krishnam Raju appears in place of Sathyaraj in the regional version for Telugu whereas Sathyaraj appears in both versions in the United States.[10] \n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Radhe Shyam\".
