The restrain in the storytelling has mostly been done to give the film a brooding mood, but it needed more moments of liveliness and spirit. It needed as much depth as the sea it shows, and as much spark as the name of the central character. But only for the beautiful and breathtaking locales and the severely underrated and underutilized Milind Soman, the film almost manages to sail through. Hallelujah it didn\u2019t drown.\"[13]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nThe film was theatrically released on 24 November 2023.[7]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was digitally released on Netflix on 19 January 2024.[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Starfish (15)\".
