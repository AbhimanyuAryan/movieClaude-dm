The film tells the story of a woman from Srinagar in Kashmir, who tries to find her husband who is abducted by the Indian army.[1] Jointly produced by Bhola and Renzu, the film stars Neelofar Hamid, Shahnawaz Bhat, Mir Sarwar and Haseena Sofi.[2] Because there are no theaters in Kashmir, the film was screened at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre.[2] \nThe title of the film refers to the namesake term used for Kashmiri women whose husbands have disappeared mostly in custody of security forces in the Kashmir conflict.[3] The film's official trailer was released in May 2017.[3] The characters in the film talk in Urdu, with some Kashmiri.[4] The film received a favourable review on Cineblitz.[5] The film was released theatrically on 6 January 2020 in India.[6]\n\n\nCast[edit]\nNeelofar Hamid\tas Neela\nShahnawaz Bhat as Zakir\nMir Sarwar as Khalid\nHaseena Sofi as Khala\nRhonda Leal as Eva\nYasmeena Wani as Zumba\nAyaan Sikander as Faizan\nProduction[edit]\nDirector Danish Renzu was doing a job at AT&T in the United States.[7] He came back to India in 2015 as he wanted to \"tell stories from my world and the place I grew up in\" that need attention and platform.[1] The film was shot in the valleys of Kashmir with local cast and crew. Sheikh Neelofar handled the casting part and approached some actors including a Bollywood actor Mir Sarwar.[2][7]  Due to the local people involved Renzu was able to shoot the film in several unexplored locations.[7] The last schedule of filming was delayed due to the 2016 Kashmir Uprising in the valley.[8] The film's dialogue writer Sunayana Kachroo, who is a poet, said that she felt the need to tell this story as \"men in conflict zones are celebrated, decorated, and revered for their heroism\", but the women and children are referred to as \"the bystanders of the discord\". She further said: \"The first and the last victims of war are always the women and the children and, due to this, they are also the torchbearers of change and progress.\"[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nNiyati Bhat of The Hindu wrote: \"'Half Widow' does not fall into the Bollywood trap of the formula Kashmir film\"[9] Aakansha Naval of Cineblitz gave it 4 stars out of 5 and wrote \"it's a hard look at the harrowing and emotional trauma of half widows in Kashmir, Danish Renzu\u2019s directorial debut is storytelling at its best and not to be missed. Danish Renzu\u2019s Half Widow differs. In fact, not just from these two films, but also from every other film that\u2019s either been made, based, set or shot in Kashmir!\"[10] Keyur Seta of Cinestaan gave it 3 stars out of 4 and write: \"It is a more intimate portrayal and captures the lives of ordinary Kashmiris. The simple and realistic dialogues are an example. The use of the local language in a number of places adds to the realism.\"[11] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll in praised the lead actors performance and wrote: \"Neelofar Hamid\u2019s sensitive and affecting portrayal accommodates the spectrum of Neela\u2019s emotional experiences, from loneliness to comfort in family and community, and from despair to hope. Neela\u2019s dilemma, articulated through a voiceover by dialogue writer Sunayna Kachroo, moves away from politics towards the direction of poetics. There is immense poignancy and wistfulness in Neela\u2019s ruminations. The seasons change, but no season brought you back, Neela says to herself as she remembers Khalid.\"[12] Sanjana Bhagwat of Shorted wrote: \"This is just what the film is \u2013 grounded, honest and real, without any glossiness of romanticism or manipulation. Familiar songs like \u2018Dilbaro\u2019 and \u2018Ae Watan\u2019 sound starkly different without the sheen of being in a Bollywood film; they can be heard in Half Widow through the static of radios or the off-key, asynchronous hum of a children's choir.\"[13]\n\nAwards and festivals[edit]\nFestivals \n\nCAAMFest , San Francisco\nSeattle International Film Festival, Seattle\nAsian Film Festival of Dallas, Dallas [14]\nIndie Meme International Film Festival, Texas\nVancouver South Asian Film Festival, Canada\nSouth Asian International Film Festival, New York\nInnovative International Film Festival, Bangalore\n2nd New Delhi Film Festival, Delhi\nLe Festival des Films Indiens de Toulouse, France\nJaipur International Film Festival, Jaipur\nTasveer South Asian Film Festival, Seattle\nChicago South Asian Film Festival, Chicago\nHouston Asian American Pacific Islander Film Festival (HAAPIFest), Houston\nUN Women, Los Angeles chapter (SPECIAL SCREENING)\nBoston Indian and International Film Festival, Boston\nMustard Seed Film Festival of Philadelphia, Philadelphia\nSan Luis Obispo International Film Festival, San Luis Obispo\nDC South Asian Film Festival, Washington DC\nNew Jersey Indian & International Film Festival, New Jersey\nCaelesdoscope International Film Festival, Rhode Island\nHyderabad Bengali Film Festival, Hyderabad\nIndian Film Festival of Cincinnati, Ohio\nNational Film Festival of Kerala, Kochi\nThird Eye Asian Film Festival, Mumbai\nIndian Film Festival Of Prague\nNominations  \n\nBest Actress (Neelofar Hamid) - Boston Indian and International Film  Festival\nBest Film - Boston Indian and International Film Festival\nLe Festival des Films Indiens de Toulouse - Film Critics Circle of India Award for the Best Debut Director Danish Renzu [15]\nIn Competition at Asia Pacific Screen Awards, Australia\nAwards\n\nAudience Choice, Best Feature Film - 2017 South Asian International Film Festival, New York (world premiere)[2]\nAudience Choice, Best Feature Film - 2018 Vancouver South Asian International Film Festival, Canada\nBest Film Award - 2018 New Jersey Indian and International Film Festival[16]\nBest Director Award  Danish Renzu - 2018 New Jersey Indian and International Film Festival[16]\nBest Actress (Neelofar Hamid) - 2018 Caelesdoscope International Film Festival\nBest Cinematography (Antonio Cisneros) - 2018 Boston Indian and International Film  Festival, Boston\nBest Film Critics Choice - 2019 Indian Film Festival of Cincinnati, Cincinnati\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Sarkar, Sonia (5 November 2017). \"If there is paradise on earth, it is not here\".
