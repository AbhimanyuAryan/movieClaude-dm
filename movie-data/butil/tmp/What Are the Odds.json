In the process, it trades superficial dazzle for a deep, lasting enchantment.\"[13] Ashameera Aiyappan of The New Indian Express called it a \"charming new age fairy tale\", lauding the film's use of an outlandish screenplay, staging and narration to present a package that is colourful, vibrant and innocent.[14] The film has been praised for its performances, cinematography, music and eccentric visual style.[citation needed]\nHowever, a few have criticized the film for preferring flash over substance. Pankhuri Shukla of The Quint felt that the film \"has the ambitious drive of a cute slice-of-life YA film that is also visually fascinating, but barely dips its toes in the genre.\"[15] Rahul Desai of Film Companion called the film a \"pretty but pointless flight of fancy\" comparing it to an over-playful bundle of puppy energy \u2013 chasing its own tail, and eventually accomplishing nothing while wanting to be a bit of everything.[16] On this note, Devansh Sharma of Firstpost pondered if the \"lack of coherency\" was an intentional aspect of the film's eccentric narrative vocabulary, eventually dismissing the notion because its \"narrative tilts towards logic whenever it is convenient, and distances itself from insanity whenever it pleases.\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jhunjhunwala, Udita (20 May 2020). \"In Netflix film 'What Are the Odds?', love, hope, music and the magic of the wonder years\".
