Known for modern relationship dramas such as Jab We Met (2007), Love Aaj Kal (2009), Rockstar (2011) and Tamasha (2015).[5] The film follows the journey of Punjab's original rockstar of the masses, Amar Singh Chamkila, who was assassinated at a young age.[6] Ali termed the film \"a unique journey\" for him and further added, \"Shooting for Chamkila felt like a very different experience as a filmmaker. The film follows the crazed popularity of Chamkila's daring songs that society could neither ignore nor swallow. It helped me reconnect with a different side of myself.\"[5][7]\nThe film was initially titled Chamkila and was later changed to Amar Singh Chamkila.[8] Parineeti Chopra and Diljit Dosanjh have sung a total of 15 songs for the film. On this, Chopra stated, \"One of the main reasons I did this film was because I was getting to sing some 15 songs for it.\"[9] The film marks Ali's return as a director after four years, and his films to not release in theatres.[7]\n\nCasting[edit]\nDiljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra were cast as the leads because of them being actors who can sing too.[10]\nDiljit Dosanjh was cast to play the titular role of Amar Singh Chamkila. Dosanjh said, \"Playing Amar Singh Chamkila has been one of the most challenging experiences of my life.\"[11]\nParineeti Chopra was cast as Chamkila's second wife, Amarjot Kaur. Chopra left Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal, to be a part of the project, due to schedule conflicts. Chopra stated, \"It's one of the most exciting films that I've ever worked on.\"[12][13] For her role in the film, Chopra gained 15 kilos.[14]\nOn casting Dosanjh and Chopra, Ali stated: \"I could not have asked for better actors than the immensely talented Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra to play in this film, especially since it involves some live singing.\"[7] Later, filmmaker Rahul Mittra was cast in a pivotal role by Ali.[15]\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe principal photography was started in December 2022.[16] Set primarily in Punjab, the film was shot at real locations throughout the state. Both Chopra and Dosanjh completed the shooting in March 2023, and the filming was wrapped up by the end of March.[17][18] Shooting locations in Punjab including Sangrur, Ludhiana and Mehsampur. A portion has also been shot in Mumbai.[19]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nMain article: Amar Singh Chamkila (soundtrack)\nThe film's soundtrack is composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Irshad Kamil. The first song, \"Ishq Mitaye\" was released on 29 February 2024.[20] The second song, \"Naram Kaalja\" was released on 14 March 2024.[21] The soundtrack received positive reviews and response from the critics.[22][23]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film's premiere was held in Mumbai on 8 April 2024.[24] The film was released on 12 April 2024 on Netflix,  coinciding with Baisakhi.[25][26]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nAmar Singh Chamkila received critical acclaim with critics praising Diljit\u2019s performance, film\u2019s soundtrack and  Ali\u2019s direction.[a] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com rated 4/5 stars and observed \"Diljit Dosanjh's switch in singing style as he smoothly assumes Amar Singh Chamkila's vocal persona highlights the brilliance of his artistry.\"[30] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and noted, \"The film is mournful and festive, animated and pensive, consciously crafted and seemingly spontaneous.\"[31] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 3/5 and wrote, \"Diljit Dosanjh internalises Amar Singh Chamkila\u2019s hard-scrabble life and pain, and distills it into his fine-grained performance, playing an artiste who lived and died by his beliefs.\"[32] Pooja Darade of Koimoi praised the film saying \"The movie leaves such a wonderful impact on you and leaves you with a lingering question\u2014why do some of the best, innovative and distinctive artists have to pay the price because of society\u2019s hypocrisy?\" She rated the film 4 out of 5 stars.[33]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Attributed to multiple references:[27][28][29]\n\n\n\n\n^ \"Amar Singh Chamkila teaser out.
