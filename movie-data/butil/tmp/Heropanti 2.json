RJ leaves for a job interview where Inaaya, a self-made millionaire from the gaming industry, sees RJ and alleges that he is her ex-boyfriend Babloo Ranawat. RJ makes it clear that he doesn't know her at all. However, Inaaya's suspicion turns out to be true. Babloo was an infamous hacker recruited by CBI officer Azaad Khan, who offers him a handsome reward to help them in thwarting the plans of Laila, who is a psychopathic magician and cyber-criminal. Laila has designed an app which steals the data of the users and also usurps the money from their bank accounts. \nBabloo infiltrates Laila's gang by wooing Laila's sister Inaaya and begins into getting a good impression of Laila and also gets lured by the money offered by him and betrays Azaad, but soon realizes that the latter is achieving to destroy lives when he meets an ambulance driver's wife Hema where he learns that her husband had saved money for his grandson's education and their dreams, but learns that their bank account had been hacked and the money went missing. Due to this, the driver committed suicide. Due to guilt, Babloo rejoins Azaad and subdues the henchmen and destroys the app's transaction. He fakes his identity as RJ and leaves to start a new life along with his adopted mother Hema. \nIn the present day, Laila learns that Babloo is hiding in Yorkshire and sends his men to nab him, but Babloo subdues them and fakes his death again. Babloo reveals to Inaaya about Laila's crimes, who joins him in the fight. Babloo leaves for Egypt, Russia and China where Laila had established his crime syndicate and kills the syndicate members. Babloo and Inaaya leaves for Heathrow Airport to receive Hema (Hema had left Bablu to visit Kedar Ghat, India). Laila orders his henchmen to kidnap Babloo's mother and Laila challenges Babloo to stop the extraction of money by throwing various challenges. Babloo overcomes various challenges where he defeats Laila and stops the extraction and leaves with Inaaya and Hema. Humiliated by the defeat, Laila commits suicide. 6 months later, Babloo, Inaaya and Babloo's mother are living in Vietnam where a mission awaits for Babloo.\n\nCast\n\nTiger Shroff as Babloo Ranawat / RJ\nNawazuddin Siddiqui as Laila\nTara Sutaria as Inaaya\nZakir Hussain as Azaad Khan\nAmrita Singh as Hema, Babloo's mother\nNaresh Gosain as Dogra\nKecha as Wong\nOliver as Zahid Malik\nVikas Verma as Ustad\nUdayabhanu Maheshwaran as Hussain\nMark Smith as Mark\nSajjad Delafrooz as Ranjit Shenoy\nSaharsh Kumar Shukla as Babloo\u2019s friend\nKanwalpreet Singh as Babloo\u2019s friend\nNikul Bhupinder Singh Sachdev as Babloo\u2019s friend\nPankaj Kansara as Babloo\u2019s friend\nNavneet Malik as Inaaya\u2019s boyfriend\nKriti Sanon Special appearance in song \"Whistle Baja 2.0\"[11]\nProduction\nPrincipal photography began in the first week of June 2021.[12][13] and first schedule was wrapped up in October 2021.[14][15]\n\nSoundtrack\nHeropanti 2Soundtrack album by A.R.
