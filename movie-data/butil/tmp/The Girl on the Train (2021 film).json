The film stars Parineeti Chopra, Avinash Tiwary, Aditi Rao Hydari and Kirti Kulhari and was released worldwide on 26 February 2021 on Netflix.[1] The film revolves around Mira Kapoor (Parineeti Chopra), an alcoholic and troubled divorcee who gets embroiled in a big murder investigation.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nNusrat is chased by someone in the forest and Mira is standing at the station. In a flashback it is shown that Mira met her husband Shekhar at a wedding where they fell in love. They both get married and Mira is pregnant. Mira is fighting a case against Jimmy Bhagga where she successfully wins and Jimmy has to go to jail. A few months later she is hit by a car. Mira suffers from anterograde amnesia caused by a car accident. She is also an alcoholic, which doesn\u2019t exactly help the memory loss either. She and Shekhar have separated and Shekhar married someone else.\nObsessed with a seemingly perfect couple she sees from the train window on her commute to London, one drunken night Mira follows the young woman into the forest but doesn\u2019t recall what happens next.\nThe police have a decent amount of circumstantial evidence against her and even move to make an arrest but Mira escapes out the window and calls in a favour from the family member of a former client and asks him to get her a phone, some cash, and a gun.\nMira discovers that the missing girl Nusrat wasn\u2019t as happily married as she looked and that she was having an affair.  It\u2019s entirely plausible that Mira is the killer \u2013 in a drunken rage which she accidentally records on her phone, Mira fantasizes about smashing Nusrat\u2019s head in, angry that she is ruining her own marriage.\nThere are plenty of other suspects too, though, including Nusrat\u2019s sex pest dance teacher, a blackmailing private eye, and more than one aggressive and abusive husband.\nIn the story, we learn that Mira\u2019s philandering ex-husband Shehkar has been gaslighting her for years. She\u2019s a blackout drunk but she isn\u2019t the violent, offensive brute that he\u2019s been claiming, and she isn\u2019t responsible for him losing his job. \nThough Nusrat was unhappy in her marriage to abusive Anand and was pregnant by someone else, Anand didn\u2019t kill her. Nor did the kindly therapist who was trying to help Nusrat. It turns out the Nusrat\u2019s baby was Shehkar\u2019s, and the night Mira followed Nusrat into \u201cGreenwich Forest\u201d Shehkar was there too and it was him who bashed Mira over the head with a rock and left her there. Nusrat told him of the pregnancy, they fought, and Shehkar strangled Nusrat, leaving her for dead.\nBut, she wasn\u2019t dead, and here\u2019s where the film diverts. It turns out there were two other people in Greenwich Forest that night. These are the police woman in charge of the case, Inspector Dalbir, and a private detective named Walter, who was hired by Anand to follow Nusrat.\nWalter\u2019s pictures from the night reveal that, unbelievably, Dalbir killed Nusrat. The daughter of an organized crime boss Mira had sent down and who had killed himself in jail(Jimmy Bhagga), Dalbir had a vendetta against Mira. It was she who crashed the jeep into Mira and Shekhar, causing Mira to lose her baby and get amnesia. It\u2019s Dalbir who later mows down and kills Walter.\nDalbir had been tailing Mira for a time, and followed her into the forest. Finding her unconscious having been hit by Shekhar, Dalbir saw an opportunity to murder her in revenge. But Nusrat, who had just woken up, caught Dalbir trying to off Mira. Dalbir can\u2019t leave a witness, so instead she decides to kill Nusrat and frame Mira for the murder.\nFollowing the trail to Walter\u2019s house, Mira solves the crime, and when Dalbir turns up to kill her and destroy the evidence ,a fight ensues and Mira ends up shooting Dalbir.\nThen there\u2019s a musical montage, a voiceover about a train where Mira decides to quit alcohol and begin a new life.\n\nCast[edit]\nParineeti Chopra as Mira Kapoor\nAditi Rao Hydari as Nusrat John Joshi\nKirti Kulhari as Inspector Dalbir Kaur Bagga\nAvinash Tiwary as Dr. Shekhar Kapoor, Mira's ex-husband\nTota Roy Chowdhury as Dr. Hamid, the psychiatrist [3]\nSuresh Sippy (Mira's Doctor)\nNisha Aaliya as Piya, Mira's friend\nSharik Khan as Wasim, Piya's friend\nDiljohn Singh as Rajiv [4]\nShamaun Ahmed as Anand Joshi, Nusrat's husband\nMonisha Hassen as Zehra, Shekhar's boss\nVaunisha Kapoor as Party Guest\nNina Kumar as Zehra's friend\nKrishan Tandon as Jimmy Bagga, Dalbir's father\nPersephone Hulewicz as Pri\nVishakh Vadgama as Officer Kunal\nNatasha Benton as Anjali Kapoor, Shekhar's second wife\nRichie Lawrie as Walter\nMatthew Park as actor\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was announced on 24 April 2019.[5] In May 2019 it was revealed that first schedule will be in England.[6] Kirti Kulhari was roped in to play a British cop.[7]\nPrincipal photography began in early August 2019 in London.[8]  Railway scenes were shot on location on the Mid-Norfolk Railway.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe Girl on the Train was scheduled for release on 8 May 2020.[10][11][12] The release was delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic.[13] The film was released on 26 February 2021 on Netflix.[1]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nThe Girl on the TrainSoundtrack album by Sunny and Inder Bawra and Vipin PatwaReleased9 February 2021[14]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength17:00LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioThe Girl on the Train - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's music was composed by Sunny and Inder Bawra and Vipin Patwa while lyrics written by Kumaar.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Chhal Gaya Chhalaa\"Sunny and Inder BawraSukhwinder Singh4:102.\"Matlabi Yariyan\"Vipin PatwaNeha Kakkar4:063.\"Mahi Mera Ranjha\"Sunny and Inder BawraNavraj Hans, Jonita Gandhi4:144.\"Matlabi Yariyan\" (Unplugged)Vipin PatwaParineeti Chopra4:30Total length:17:00\nReception[edit]\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
