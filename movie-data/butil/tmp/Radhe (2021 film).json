He kills a man for not returning the money he borrowed from him. The man is an accomplice of Mansoor Bhai. Rana starts selling drugs to not only to college students but to school children as well. Due to this, 12 people committed suicide in the last 3 months due to drug addiction. Mumbai Police send two senior officers to stop Rana but they were heavily drugged and killed. The police force decides to send Radhe, an undercover police officer to the case. He accepts the job. Radhe meets Diya Abhyankar, a model, and falls in love with her. Radhe tells her that he is an aspiring model and that his name is Bholu. Diya slowly falls in love with Radhe. Radhe finds out from fellow officers that there are two gangs that operate under their jurisdiction. The first gang is led by Dilawar and the second gang is led by Dagdu Dada. Both the gangs are at war with each other.\nRadhe defeats all the men in Dagdu Dada's gang including Dada. Radhe arrests one of Dada's men and question him. He tells him that Dilawar's brother Mansoor deals with drugs. Radhe goes to Dilawar's area and threatens them to bring him Mansoor. Dilawar agrees but Radhe arrests Dilawar. He makes Dilawar and Dada find peace with each other. Rana teams up with Mansoor and they lure Dilawar to them. Rana and his men brutally stab Dilawar to death. Later, Radhe finds out that Diya is the sister of Radhe's senior officer Avinash Abhyankhar. Avinash approves of their relationship. Rana and his guards kill Dada's gang members.  In the next two days, Rana sells more drugs. Radhe gets information that Rana and his guards will be going to the Allied PD club. Radhe goes to the pub and fights Rana in the restroom. Radhe gets beat up by Rana and his guards. They escape just as the police arrive.\nDiya finds out that Radhe is a police officer and confesses her love to him. Radhe arrests Mansoor and convinces him to join his side. Radhe beats up Rana's guards with the help of Dagdu but one of them escapes and informs Rana. Rana kills Dagdu for revenge. Radhe is deemed incompetent and another officer is handed the case. Radhe, with the help of Avinash, continues his job covertly. Meanwhile, one of Rana's guard, who was arrested, meets with two police officers. They make a deal. The officers will let the guard escape if he supplies them with drugs. The guard accepts the deal. The two officers are revealed to be hired by Radhe as a ruse. Rana's guard meets up with the officers later and gets captured by Radhe. Rana finds out that Mansoor works with Radhe and kills him.\nRadhe seeks the help of school students. They accept and start taking photos of Rana's gang and the people they supply drugs to Radhe, who along with his fellow police officers, arrests all of them. One of the police officer named Nikisha gets caught by Rana. Rana is about to kill her but Radhe saves her. Rana escapes and Radhe chases after him but loses sight of him after a while. The next day, some of Rana's guards who were arrested, escape. Radhe kills most of them except for one of the guard who gets in a helicopter with Rana. Rana plans to move away from Mumbai and create a drug business elsewhere. Radhe jumps onto the helicopter and fights Rana and the guard. Due to their fight, the helicopter crashes, killing the guard.  Avinash arrives and tries to kill Rana but Rana thrashes Avinash and is about to kill him. Radhe saves Avinash and fight Rana. Radhe gets the upper hand and kills Rana.\n\nCast\n\nSalman Khan as Radhe, Diya's love interest\nDisha Patani as Diya Abhyankar, Radhe's love interest and Avinash's sister\nRandeep Hooda as Rana, the main antagonist[13]\nJackie Shroff as ACP Crime Branch Avinash Abhyankar, Radhe's senior officer and Diya's brother[13]\nSudhanshu Pandey as Dilawar\nMegha Akash as Nikisha[14]\nBharath as Inspector Sarvesh[15]\nGautam Gulati as Girgit[16]\nGovind Namdev as Joint Commissioner (Operations) I.

This was a limited second release post a successful reception as an OTT release at Zee5 garnering over 14 million views.\n\nCritical response\nThe film received highly negative reviews from critics and audience. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 9% based on 11 reviews and an average rating of 1.6/10.[78] IMDB gave the film 1.9/10, the lowest rated film of Khan on the website.[79]\nAnna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave Radhe a rating of 0/5 and wrote \"This film is so generic that it would be a challenge to write down the plot from A-Z after a single viewing. Salman Khan's performance reiterates the fact that he is not looking at gaining any validation from the audiences taking them for granted\". She also criticised  the movie for not giving the lead actress enough screen time by stating, \"The movie treats its \u2018heroine\u2019 as nothing but a body on display whose sole job is to give the hero someone to fall in love with, dance with and protect\".[80] Stutee Ghosh from The Quint gave Radhe a rating of 0.5/5. Calling it a \"cringefest\" she wrote, \"Radhe is a loud, senseless and offensive film that has little regard for women, the police force and the audience's intelligence in general\". She further stated, \"Radhe is frustratingly tone deaf to how it promotes police brutality and the almost suffocating toxic masculinity that is sprayed on like a cheap deodorant\".[81] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave Radhe a rating of 0.5/5 and wrote, \"Radhe is a mindless, moronic mess of a movie in which Salman does every single thing he's done a zillion times\".[82] Soumya Srivastava from The Hindustan Times called Radhe a torture of a film and one of Khan's worst movies. She described Radhe as a \"cringeworthy movie\" and stated, \"The movie is nothing but a collection of action sequences piled upon each other as Disha's tight dresses, some dance numbers, and goons saying 'apun' a lot act as fillers\".[83]\nSaibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave the film a rating of 2/5 and opined that \"The film dumps a whole lot of dross on us with a certain degree of surface stink.\" He concluded by saying \"Radhe has no inducements for diehard Salman Khan fans to keep them interested\".[84] Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh gave Radhe a rating of 2/5 and called it \"Disappointing\". Calling its screenplay and writing \"lackluster\" he wrote,  \"Radhe doesn't meet the sky-high expectations, The film has a clich\u00e9d plot and a predictable formula remodelled with new packaging\".[85] Anupama Chopra of Film Companion wrote, \"The Salman Khan starrer is so free of craft that it hurts; Prabhudeva delivers yet another loud, numbing, pointless paean to the cult of Salman Khan\".[86] Namrata Joshi from The National Herald wrote, \"Radhe is an empty vessel of a film that tries to sail through by making a lot of loud noise that signifies nothing\". Criticising the framing of Patani's character she further wrote, \"Diya itself is acutely offensive. It just shows the acutely conservative mindset of the makers and of the Salman Khan universe itself, where men and women are hardly ever in a relationship of equals, where the man is this self-anointed \u201cprotector\u201d of the woman and the woman is seen as some kind of a property or possession\".[87] Sushri Sahu of Mashable criticised Radhe for glorifying police brutality, gun violence and toxic masculinity. She further wrote, \"Radhe is repetitive with not just the dialogues but the rogue cop-on-a-cleaning-spree formula. It doesn't even spare the minimum of one rape assault trope. The film, in fact, looks like a brochure to sell Khan's already popular brand. It is out-and-out \u2018bhai\u2019 porn\".[88]\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Parashar, Shivam (27 January 2021). \"What is Radhe story? Salman Khan goes the South Korea route one more time after Bharat\".
