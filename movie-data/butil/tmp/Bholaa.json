An undercover officer Abbas Ali, known as Raunak, has joined Ashwathama alias Ashu, who is co-leader of the Sikka Gang. Raunak gives information about Ashu to Diana, while Ashu seeks help from corrupt NCB officer Devraj Subramaniam, who instructs another officer Deep Singh to add rohypnol to drinks made for police officers at the farewell party of IG Jayant Malik. Diana does not partake due to medication, but everyone else falls unconscious.\nA prisoner named Bholaa has been released from prison and Joseph tries to convince him to drive a truck taking the sedated officers to the hospital then on to Laalganj police station. Although reluctant at first, Bholaa agrees. Meanwhile, Ashu hires a bounty on Joseph and the rest of her police force. As Joseph, Bholaa and sidekick Kadchi drive they are attacked by various gangs. Deep Singh, who has hidden with the sedated officers, provides them with the location updates. A cat-and-mouse game ensues in which Bholaa kills all the goons. Ashu also sends his gang to attack the police station and to free his brother Nithari, who was caught with the cocaine. \nInspector Angad Yadav, who was recently transferred to Laalganj, gets assigned by Joseph to defend the police station. When Ashu arrives with his gang, they try to breach the police station which is barricaded by Yadav and some students. Joseph is nearly tricked into ordering the release of the prisoners, but she realizes that it was a trap set by Nithari. Ashu manages to get inside the police station, but Yadav and the students manage to arrest him. One of the student Chetan gets strangled to death by Ashu's gang and Yadav, fuming with rage, kills Ashu. Joseph contacts medics to provide an emergency ambulance at a temple of Lord Shiva. \nAs they wait, Bholaa narrates his past in which he was a notorious gangster in Uttar Pradesh and fell in love with a doctor Swara, who reciprocated his love after he saved her from being assaulted. Before their marriage, Bholaa gave up his gangster life, but Swara was killed by a ruthless gang leader known as Chomu Singh. Before dying, Swara gave birth to their daughter Jyoti, but Bholaa got separated from her after receiving a long-term prison sentence. Joseph shares her story about how she lost her unborn child when she was pregnant. An ambulance finally arrives and takes the sedated officers to hospital. After this, Ashu's henchman Bhoora also arrives. Before Bholaa is able to fight, Deep Singh stabs him and Bholaa is brutally injured. \nWhile Joseph and Kadchi are taken away, Abbas is killed when he is discovered as the mole. Bholaa later regains consciousness and single-handedly kills the whole gang, including Deep Singh, using the Trident of Lord Shiva. After this, Bholaa chases after Bhoraa, rescuing Joseph. After driving all night, Bholaa, Kadchi and Diana arrive in the police station using a secret passage and help the students along with Yadav to escape safely. Joseph burns the cocaine and after Ashu's reinforced gang finally breaches station, Bholaa destroys them all using a M134 Minigun. Shortly after, Nithari dies of shock after learning about Bholaa and Devraj Subramaniam shoots himself after knowing that Bholaa was behind everything. Bholaa is reunited with Jyoti and they drive off happily in the truck with Kadchi and a puppy. \nIn the mid-credits scene, Chomu Singh learns about Bholaa's release and sets out to hunt him down.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAjay Devgn as Bholaa\nTabu as SP Diana Joseph\nSanjay Mishra as Constable Angad Yadav\nDeepak Dobriyal as Ashwathama 'Ashu', Nithari's younger brother\nGajraj Rao as Devraj Subramaniam\nVineet Kumar as Nithari, Ashu's elder brother\nKiran Kumar as IG Jayant Malik\nMakarand Deshpande as a prisoner\nArpit Ranka as Bhoora\nAmir Khan as Kadchi\nKhan Jahangir Khan as Sarangi\nLokesh Mittal as Deep Singh, police officer\nHirva Trivedi as Jyoti, Bholaa's daughter\nArzoo Soni as Rachna\nTarun Gahlot as Abbas Ali aka Raunak\nDeepali Gautam as Naina\nMukund Ramesh Pal as Baingan\nChetan Sharma as Chetan aka Chashmish\nPriyank Tiwary as Shekhar\nAmit Pandey as Nithari's Man\nBachchan Pachera as Orphanage guard\nJyoti Gauba as Dr. Surbhi\nAkhilesh Mishra as Arpit Mishra\nSima Pari as Orphanage teacher\nYuri Suri as a harasser\nRaai Laxmi as a bar dancer (cameo appearance in the item song \"Paan Dukaniya\")\nAmala Paul as Dr. Swara, Bholaa's wife and Jyothi's mother (cameo appearance)\nAbhishek Bachchan as Chomu Singh, Bholaa's rival (cameo appearance)\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography for the film commenced on 13 January 2022.[7] Filming took place in Hyderabad, Madh Island, Kharghar, Mumbai and Varanasi.[8] The entire filming for Bholaa was wrapped up on 6 January 2023.[9]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nBholaaSoundtrack album by Ravi BasrurReleased9 April 2023Recorded2021-22GenreFeature film soundtrackLength23:00LabelT-SeriesSaregama (1 song)Official audioBholaa (Audio Jukebox) on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Ravi Basrur while lyrics are written by Irshad Kamil.
