It stars Radhika Madan, Rajat Barmecha and Ayush Mehra in the lead roles. The film explores about the life of siblings-brother and sister who are cricket crazy mad siblings and their bond.[1]\nThe film was premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival and received rave reviews.[2] The film was also screened at the World Film Festival of Bangkok and International Film Festival of Kerala.[3] The film began streaming on JioCinema on 19 May 2023.[4][5]\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nAditi, who has grown up in the shadow of her brother who was often sidelined earlier due to social norms and restrictions for a typical Indian girl. Meanwhile, Aditi initially wanted to be a fashion designer but her father wanted her to study medicine and become doctor. Aditi makes a challenge to his elder brother Aakash which eventually is going to decide the future pathway of his life as Aditi bets if she wins against him in the gully cricket tournament, Akash has to obey his father's wish of attending regular corporate job interviews thereby putting his cricket dream away. Initially, Akash got the green light from his father who encouraged him to take up the sport from childhood but later opposed it as he gave up the hope that his son wouldn't be better if he chooses to stick with gully cricket and forced Akash to attend job interviews. Akash clearly had one goal in his life which was to play for Indian cricket team one day.\nHence the challenge is set to be a make or break moment for Akash and he accepts to play against his sister in the gully cricket tournament, with perspective-altering results.[6] Aditi somehow manages to assemble a team of rookies and new fresh faces to battle in the gully cricket league known as Underarm Premier League (UPL) against her brother. Aditi even pulls one of his brother's former teammates to form her team and she names her team as Kacchey Limbu. Initially Kacchey Limbu team looked clueless and looked thin on paper but eventually became a competent team which gave a run for its money to other teams in the league.[7]\n\nCast[edit]\nRadhika Madan as Aditi Nath, Aakash's younger sister\nRajat Barmecha as Aakash Nath, Aditi's elder brother\nAyush Mehra as Kabir Saini\nMahesh Thakur as Ajit Nath, Aakash and Aditi's father\nPurva Parag as Anjali Nath, Aakash and Aditi's mother\nJaywant Wadkar as Sudhakar Uncle\nFaiz Khan as Zakir\nVedaansh Jaju as Yuvi\nAisha Ahmed as Sara\nSukhita Aiyar as Kavita Ma'm\nShreya Kapoor as Charvi\nTanushree Das as Ira\nPradeep Nigam as building secretary and commentator\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kacchey Limbu Review: Radhika Madan's light-hearted sibling rivalry is an entertaining watch\".
