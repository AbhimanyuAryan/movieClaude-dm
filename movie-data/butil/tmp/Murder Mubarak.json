The members of club include: \n\nLeo Matthews: A lecherous gym trainer, who has relationships with all women at the club\nYash Batra: A drug addict who has returned from rehab, but still cant overcome his addiction\nMaharaja Rannvijay Singh: A descendant of a Royal Family who likes to show off his wealth. He is competing for the post of President at  club\nRoshni Batra: Yash's mother, who likes to talk nonsense and brag about everything\nThe Dogras: A middle-aged couple whose son is in a relationship with a Bengali girl\nAakash Dogra: The son of Dogras, who has just returned from Kolkata\nShehnaaz Noorani: An actress, who is also vying for the post of President at the club.\nBambi Todi: A young widow, Aakash's love interest\nCookie Katoch: An alcoholic sculptor\nBhatti: The current president of the club\nAnd the servants and other working staff:\n\nGuppie Ram: A dementia ridden old servant\nThinsuk: A gym trainer from Arunachal Pradesh\nTheju: A gym trainer from Karnataka\nMinu Dimri: Theju's girlfriend who is also having an affair with Leo\nGanga: The beauty parlor lady\n\nThe film starts with Tambola night, where an introduction to every character is given. The next day gym trainer Leo Matthews dies from a heavy barbell falling on his windpipe and ACP Bhavani Singh is assigned the case with SI Padam Kumar. President Bhatti believes it to be an open and shut case, but Bhavani Singh believes it to be a murder due to party balloons covering the CCTV camera and a pet cat, Prince Harry, showing signs of sickness. Investigation undergoes with the first characters who saw the dead body: Roshni Batra, Cookie Katoch and Bambi Todi, when they visited the gym. They point towards Aakash Dogra, who claimed to be Leo's lawyer during a fight between Rannvijay Singh and Leo on Tambola Night. \nOn investigation with Aakash, he reveals that he helped Leo during a drug case. The ladies also claimed Shehnaz Noorani, the actress having an affair with Leo and Rannvijay Singh having an affair with Ganga, the beauty parlor lady. During investigation, Rannvijay Singh becomes defensive about Ganga further strengthening Bhavani's doubts about Rannvijay being the murderer. \nLeo's forensic reports reveal presence of a drug named Pinko Haathini in his body in absurd amounts, that makes a human unable to lift even lightest items, let alone a barbell. Bambi overhears this. Interrogation with Guppie Ram, Thinsuk, Theju and Minu all lead to nothing. \nA love story between Bambi and Aakash re-ignites and it is revealed Yash Batra, a drug addict and Aakash are best friends. Bambi reveals to Aakash, that after the death of her husband, Anshul, she became kleptomaniac again and Leo knew this, so he was blackmailing her. They report this to ACP Bhavani Singh and it leads them to an orphanage: Shepherd's Orphanage where Bambi had made the donations. The orphanage's donation list contains names of multiple people from the club, which renews interest in them.\nRoshni, Rannvijay and Shehnaaz discard the allegations of Leo blackmailing them, whereas flashbacks show something else. The orphanage's limp warden Rakesh sings praises for Leo for bringing in so many donations. Bambi reveals the involvement of the drug Pinko in Leo's death and so Bambi and Aakash go to a club to find dealers who are selling the drug. A dealer reveals that Ganga's husband, Ajay Kumar was involved in dealing drugs to members of the Royal Delhi Club. They also catch Yash buying drugs from the same dealer and so decide to break into his home. Bambi finds packets of the drug in his drawer, of which she captures photos. \nAt Leo's funeral, Shehnaaz reveals that she gave birth to her daughter during Mumbai Riots. Guppie Ram did not attend the funeral. On questioning Guppie Ram on why he did not attend the funeral, he says that Leo had committed many sins and so his time had come, just like the person before. Bhavani asks which person he was mentioning, but Guppie's dementia kicks in and he does not answer. \nOn the day of Elections for president of club, Cookie gifts her sculpts of Shehnaaz and Rannvijay. There is a fight between Yash and Aakash over some unknown topic. Guppie Ram cannot find his cat, Hariya and later finds Hariya burnt inside the kitchen oven. Overriden by guilt, Guppie Ram commits suicide using Rannvijay's flare gun. After their fight, Aakash gives the evidence against Yash to Bhavani Singh, but Bhavani Singh finds nothing at Yash's house. He also mentions an absconded Ajay Kumar, which leads to questioning with Ganga, who says that the only person who knew about Ajay Kumar being violent with her was Rannvijay Singh. \nOn investigating Rannvijay, it is revealed that he is a poor heir of a declining royal descent and cannot even afford to eat meals twice a day, which he packs from Royal Delhi Club. It is also revealed that he is gay and in a relationship with gym trainer Thinsuk, which Leo knew. Rannvijay Singh is also against excavating the kitchen garden site, named after his late wife. On suspicion, where Bhavani Singh knows that Guppie Ram was pouring acid on kitchen garden, he gets the site excavated. It reveals a human skeleton. They assume it to be of Ajay Kumar, Ganga's absconding husband and send it for forensics. Rannvijay Singh is to be arrested. \nThe revelation of human skeleton kicks things into action, as Bambi finds footage of Aakash returning to her first anniversary party, the day after which Ajay Kumar is absconding. She also finds footage of Rannvijay Singh beating up Ajay with Ganga by Rannvijay's side. She saves the footage on her phone and deletes it. Leo's tablet is procured by warden Rakesh of Shepherd Orphanage and he calls Aakash to the orphanage. \nThere are shards of blue crystal found in the left eye socket of the skeleton which are revealed to be rare crystals. Bhavani Singh knows that only one person of club uses such rare crystals and that is Cookie Katoch who sculpts. Cookie reveals she gifted two busts of Indira Gandhi to Rannvijay Singh and the Dogras respectively. The bust is found intact at Rannvijay's house, whereas the bust at Dogra's house is missing. Bhavani Singh also gets to know that Aakash returned to the first anniversary party on the day Ajay Kumar went missing. \nBhavani Singh starts suspecting Aakash behind the murders. Aakash and Bambi share an intimate moment, but Aakash finds the earrings he gifted to Bambi in possessions of Leo, which drives a rift between them. Bhavani Singh gets to know of the intimate moments that Bambi shared with Leo and asks her to stay away from the case as she is also a suspect. Meanwhile, Yash tries to commit suicide by overdosing himself and drowning in a bathtub and he leaves behind a letter that says that he loved Bambi so much that he could not bear Bambi getting close to Aakash again.\nIn a shocking turn of events, Ajay Kumar is captured alive and he says that Aakash wanted him behind bars, that was the reason he was absconding. Bhavani Singh gathers everyone at the club and reveals that the skeleton found in Kitchen garden was not of Ajay Kumar, but of Anshul, Bambi's dead husband, who was supposed to be dead in an accident on way to Uttarakhand. He also reveals that the warden of Shepherd Orphanage, Rakesh was Shehnaz's son, whom she gave birth during Mumbai Riots. Bhavani Singh first claims that Yash killed Anshul because he loved Bambi and he could not bear Bambi marrying Anshul. Guppie Ram was Yash's associate. Roshni, Yash's mother becomes defendant of her son saying that he will never commit such a heinous act. Bhavani Singh puts forward another theory that Aakash killed Anshul on the day of Anshul and Bambi's first anniversary. There is missing evidence due to footage being deleted and the bust missing from Dogras, which was the weapon. He also claims Aakash killed Leo because Leo knew about this and was blackmailing Aakash and Bambi. Aakash is defiant of claims but gives in and accepts prison sentence.\nLooking at the love of her life getting prison sentence, Bambi makes confessions. She confesses that Anshul was having an affair with Ganga and wanted to divorce Bambi and marry Ganga. Bambi wanted to keep the image of their perfect marriage infront of the club and asked Anshul not to divorce her, but Anshul did not budge. In anger, she used the bust, gifted to her by Aakash's grandmother as a weapon and it killed Anshul. She told Guppie Ram that Anshul had raped Ganga and so Guppie Ram helped Bambi hide his body in the kitchen garden and that was why he was pouring acid on the kitchen garden. One night, Leo made Guppie drunk and Guppie revealed the secret of Bambi. Leo started blackmailing Bambi and so Bambi decided to kill Leo with the drug Pinko. She tried to frame Yash for the murder but Yash cleaned up the planted drugs before police could reach there. She kept Hariya in the oven and sent Guppie on a guilt trip which killed him. She also tried to kill Yash by overdosing him and drowning him in the bathtub, but Yash was saved. Bambi is incarcerated and Aakash walks out free as Bambi's lawyer. \nAt the end of the movie, Bhavani Singh advises Aakash to stay out of Bambi's case. It is also revealed that Aakash has no girlfriend in Kolkata.\n\nCast[edit]\nPankaj Tripathi as ACP Bhavani Singh\nSara Ali Khan as Bambi Todi\nVijay Varma as Kaashi / Aakash Dogra\nKarisma Kapoor as Shehnaz Noorani\nDimple Kapadia as Cookie Katoch\nTisca Chopra as Roshni Batra\nSanjay Kapoor as Rannvijay Singh\nSuhail Nayyar as Yash Batra\nTara Alisha Berry as Ganga\nAashim Gulati as Leo Mathews\nDeven Bhojani as Devendra Bhatti\nRohit Rajvansh as Movie Director\nAshok Chhabra as Shaan Thakur\nAlok Panwar as Ajay Kumar\nBrijendra Kala as Guppie Ram\nRajat Malhotra as Chef\nSuhaas Ahuja as Staff Manager\nPurnendu Bhattacharya as Brigadier Balbir Dogra\nGrusha Kapoor as Mrs. Dogra - Mala\nTrilochan Kalra as Anshul's father\nBeila Gupta as Anshul's mother\nVarun Mitra as Anshul\nPriyank Tiwary as PK, Sub Inspector Padam Kumar\nKiara Sadh as Little Girl\nHardeep Gupta as Bambi's Mother\nHitesh Sejpal as Bambi's Father\nHardika Sharma as Young Bambi\nAbeer Jain as Young Kaashi\nBobby Singh as Minister Gagan Ruia\nBalakrishnan Natarajan as Police Chief Commissioner Samir Faruqui\nProduction[edit]\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced in February 2023[9] and wrapped  in April 2023.[10]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released on Netflix on 15 March 2024.[11]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMurder MubarakSoundtrack album by Sachin\u2013JigarReleased22 March 2024[12]Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength12:36LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanySachin\u2013Jigar chronology\n\n\nFarrey(2023)\n\nMurder Mubarak(2024)\n\n\nOfficial audioMurder Mubarak - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music is composed by Sachin\u2013Jigar.
