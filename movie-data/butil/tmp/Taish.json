The film stars Pulkit Samrat, Jim Sarbh, Harshvardhan Rane, Kriti Kharbanda and Sanjeeda Shaikh. It is produced by Deepak Mukut, Bejoy Nambiar, and Nishant Pitti.[1][2][3] The film was released on ZEE5 on 29 October 2020 as a feature film and six episodic series, simultaneously.[4][5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nRohan Kalra(Jim Sarbh), an Indian General Practitioner lives with his girlfriend Aarfa Khan(Kriti Kharbanda), a Pakistani Orthopaedic Surgeon in the UK. Rohan receives an invitation to attend his brother, Krish's (Ankur Rathee) wedding. This creates a tense situation between Aarfa and Rohan, since Aarfa is a Pakistani Muslim and Rohan fears his parents never accepting her. So, he eventually leaves for the wedding by himself. At the wedding, his mother is eager for Rohan to get married as well and forces him to consider some marriage proposals. The atmosphere changes when Sunny Lalwani(Pulkit Samrat), Rohan's best friend, arrives at the wedding. Later that evening, it is revealed that Krish's fiance, Mahi, had cheated on him with one of her exes, a month before the wedding.\nSimultaneously, a crime family head, Kuljinder, marries Jahaan forcibly, who is in love with Kuljinder's younger brother, Pali(Harshvardhan). Pali wants to leave the family and run away with Jahaan(Sanjeeda). Pali arrives at the venue on the day of the wedding and threatens Kuljinder with a gun. However, Pali gets dragged out of the venue before he could do anything. The marriage infuriates Pali who vows not to kill Kuljinder until Kuljinder fires the first bullet. A few days later, Jahaan escapes home to be with Pali. She later informs him that she's pregnant with his child. Pali decides to run away with Jahaan and start a new life, however, his dreams shatter after Jahaan's sister, Sanober, discovers the truth and forces Jahaan to abort.\nThe two families collide with each other after Sunny discovers that Rohan's childhood molester is Rohan's father's friend, Kuljinder. Sunny beats Kuljinder badly, paralysing him forever and damaging his vocal cords such that he can't speak. When this gets to Kuljinder's family they blame Pali because of his earlier threat to Kuljinder on his wedding with Jahaan. To prove his innocence, Pali vows to avenge his brother's state resulting in Sunny and Krish being kidnapped at Krish's wedding where Krish is killed, and Sunny badly injured. Pali and Sukhi, his best friend, are arrested after Rohan and his family file a case against them. Pali is jailed, and Rohan moves to somewhere remote after blaming Sunny for Krish's death.\nTwo years pass by and Rohan is contacted by Sunny's sister through Aarfa, who informs him of Sunny's disappearance. It turns out that Sunny is in the same jail as Pali to exact revenge for Krish's death. Here we learn that one year after Krish's death, his fianc\u00e9e Mahi committed suicide in Bristol leading to Sunny taking this step. Rohan along with Aarfa and Shozi gets him out of jail before he commits anything. It is revealed that Kuljinder's business is now run by his wife Sanober and Pali from jail who gets to know of Sunny's plan to kill him. Meanwhile Rohan and Aarfa patch things up and get engaged.\nAt Rohan's residence he and Aarfa along with Sunny's sister get attacked by Sukhi, who threatens them to tell him about Sunny's location. After a brief argument, Sunny's sister is held at knife point so Rohan is forced to tell him about Sunny's whereabouts. They later escape and save him. Sunny threatens Pali that he is going to kill his younger brother Jassi. Later Sunny and Rohan go to a bar where Sunny gets drunk and shoots Jassi. Watching his brothers dead body Pali swears revenge and plans to get out of jail to staging an injury. Rohan then decides to directly confront Pali and get things over, Pali is shocked to know about Kuljinder's deeds and confirms the same with Sanober. He escapes on the way to hospital and along with Sukhi goes to his home where he asks Jahan to run away with him.\nThe final episode ends with a chase sequence between Sunny- Rohan and Pali- Sukhi. This results in Pali having an accident where Sukhi is killed instantly. Then Sunny and Rohan fight Pali together who is weak due to his accident. They manage to bring him down but Sunny is shot in the process and he later dies. The series ends with a clip of Jahan waiting for Pali at an airport.\n\nCast[edit]\nHarshvardhan Rane as Pali Brar\nPulkit Samrat as Sunny Lalwani\nKriti Kharbanda as Aarfa Khan, Rohan's love interest\nJim Sarbh as Rohan Kalra, Sunny's childhood friend\nAnkur Rathee as Krish Kalra, Rohan's brother\nZoa Morani as Mahi, Krish's fiance\nSanjeeda Sheikh as Jahaan Brar, Pali's love interest, Sanober's sister\nMelissa Raju Thomas as Simmi, Sunny's love interest (cameo appearance)\nSaurabh Sachdeva as Sukhi\nAbhimanyu Singh as Kuljinder \"Kulli\" Brar, Pali and Jassi's brother\nViraf Patel as Shozi\nArmaan Khera as Jassi Brar, Pali's brother\nSaloni Batra as Sanober Brar, Kulli's wife\nKunika as Beeji\nIkhlaque Khan as Rohan's father\nMohnisha Haseen as Rohan's mother\nMahavir Bhullar as Gyaan ji\nShivanshu Pandey as Ismail\nEkansh Kumar Sharma as Sattu\nSoundtrack[edit]\nTaishSoundtrack album by Raghav Sachar, Prashant Pillai, Govind Vasantha, Enbee and Gaurav GodkhindiReleased20 October 2020[6]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength32:52LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioTaish - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's music was composed by Raghav Sachar, Prashant Pillai, Govind Vasantha, Enbee and Gaurav Godkhindi, while lyrics were written by Rohit Sharma, Hussain Haidry, Armaan Khera and Enbee.[7][8]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Kol Kol\"Rohit SharmaRaghav SacharJyotica Tangri3:362.\"Roshni Si\"Hussain HaidryPrashant PillaiAshwin Gopakumar, Preeti Pillai3:183.\"Re Bawree\"Hussain HaidryGovind VasanthaPrarthana Indrajith, Govind Vasantha5:004.\"Shehnaiyan Wajan Do\"EnbeeEnbeeEnbee, Raahi3:455.\"Rage Infinity\"InstrumentalGaurav GodkhindiInstrumental1:436.\"Re Bawree\" (Jahaan Lost In Love)Hussain HaidryGovind VasanthaSona Mohapatra4:577.\"Kol Kol\" (Reprise)Rohit SharmaRaghav SacharMohan Kannan3:398.\"All I See Is The\" (Roshni Si - Reprise)Hussain Haidry, Armaan KheraPrashant PillaiPreeti Pillai, Armaan Khera3:209.\"Kol Kol Mix\"InstrumentalRaghav SacharInstrumental3:34Total length:32:52\nCritical reception[edit]\nAnna MM Vetticad from Firstpost rated Taish 3.25 out of 5 and stated \"Taish the series is fair enough, but it is the film that manages to effectively convey the wrath and passion of the title, making it Nambiar\u2019s best work yet\".[9] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express wrote \"The web series goes back and forth in time, and then leaps to the present, leading to some amount of confusion. And then there is Nambiar\u2019s old nemesis, the lack of substance which you end up missing in all the style\".[10]\nPallabi Dey Purkayastha from The Times Of India wrote \" Taish is timely, stylish and has an important life lesson to impart \u2013 that revenge is never the answer and rage triggers rage \u2013 but the execution and storytelling technique should have been much tighter, and with a climax that would have taken the viewers by total surprise\".[11]\nAdithya Narayan Taish from The Hindu reviewed \"Taish\u2019s failure lies in its inability to exploit one of the luxuries afforded by the medium: scope for character development.[12] Scroll.in stated Taish always looks poised to say something deep and memorable about the need to process old wounds and think before you act. It\u2019s often loud and unwieldy, but it\u2019s flashy and good-looking too in its own way\".[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Taish: Bejoy Nambiar's upcoming film will star Jim Sarbh, Amit Sadh, Harshvardhan Rane in lead roles\".
