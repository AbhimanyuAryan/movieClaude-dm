It is unlike anything you would have seen before.\"[6] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu said \"Fairy Folk begins like an urban fantasy that demands suspension of disbelief but, by the end, you feel like wanting to willingly surrender to its discomforting spell of magic realism that lingers.\"[7]\nToshiro Agarwal of Times Now said \"Karan Gour\u2019s attempt to blend reality with fantasy is truly praiseworthy. The film, despite its evidently limited budget, features really high quality of production and a well-researched script.\"[8]\nRohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal said \"The film raises certain questions about modern-day relationships, people, and their alter egos. Away from big stars and big-budget marketing campaigns, Fairy Folk is a silent and honest film.\"[9]\nRahul Desai of Film Companion stated in his review that \"Evidently, Fairy Folk is a weird film. But it\u2019s a poignant and funny kind of weird. The parables fly thick and fast.[10]\nSreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India said \"Fairy Folk\" is worth seeing for its original concept and methodology alone, as much as the impromptu, moving performances.\"[11]\nMayur Sanap rediff.com said \"The premise is incredibly wacky and yet simple, and thus, smart writing, direction, and acting are necessary for the film to be convincing. It certainly is, thanks to Gour's skillful hold on the subject matter.\"[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Firstpost (2022-08-17). \"Mukul Chadda and Rasika Dugal's Fairy Folk to screen at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne\".
