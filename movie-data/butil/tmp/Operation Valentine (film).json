This bilingual project is set for a release in both Telugu and Hindi.[2]\nOn 19 October 2023, the makers announced principal photography of the film was wrapped up.[4]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nThe soundtrack and background score were composed by Mickey J Meyer. Saregama acquired the audio rights. The film's first single, \"Vande Mataram,\" was unveiled at the Wagah Border.[5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on 8 December 2023, but was rescheduled to 16 February 2024, owing to a delay in post-production work.[6]\nLater, the film was released on 1 March 2024 in theaters worldwide.[7]\nThe film's post-theatrical streaming rights were acquired by Amazon Prime Video, and the film started streaming on Prime from 22 March 2024.\n\nReception[edit]\nOperation Valentine received mixed reviews.\nArjun Menon of Rediff.com gave 3/5 stars and notes \"Operation Valentine follows the templates of similar air force narratives to deliver some rousing, harmless fun time.\"[8]\nPaul Nicodemus of The Times of India also rated 3.0 out of 5 stars and stated that \"Operation Valentine is a respectful nod to the bravery of the Indian Air Force, offering audiences a mix of action, patriotism, and drama. While it may not reach the emotional or cinematic heights of its preceding aerial combat and air force films, it remains a decent watch for its spirited portrayal of heroism and sacrifice in the face of adversity.\"[9]\nThe film received flak for abandoning craft in favour of jumping \"on the patriotism bandwagon\" and milking the Pulwama episode.[10][11]\nSangeetha Devi of The Hindu writes that the writing \"fails to offer anything new\", with an underwritten relationship between the lead actors, and forgettable characters. [12] Raghu Bandi of The Indian Express gave the film 1.5/5 stars, writing that the film \"lacks a human story\", \"graphic work appears patchy\" and production values leave a lot to be desired\", while praising Varun Tej's performance.[13] The New Indian Express gave the film 2/5 stars, criticising the writing, stating that it \"doesn\u2019t have the novelty or invention to grab our attention\". The review displays disappointment with Varun Tej's acting, calling it discomforting, while remarking that Chhillar brings \"a certain understated intensity to her character\" despite the poorly-written role.[10]\n\nSee also[edit]\nFighter, another 2024 Indian film with a similar theme\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Operation Valentine (2024)\".
