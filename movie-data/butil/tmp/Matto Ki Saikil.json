Gani.[2] The story is based on 'Matto' portrayed by Prakash Jha, who is a daily-wage laborer and his attachment to his bicycle.[3]\nThe film stars Prakash Jha, Anita Choudhary, Aarohi Sharma, Idhika Roy, Dimpy Mishra, Chandra Prakash Sharma, and Aryan Madar. It was theatrically released in India on 16 September 2022.[4]\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nMatto is a daily wage construction laborer, responsible for the livelihood of his family which includes his wife and two young daughters. Every day, he takes a long distance journey from his rural life to the city, riding his heavily worn out bicycle to work. One day, his bicycle is damaged beyond repair in an accident, causing his work and his family to suffer.  He manages to buy a new one with great effort. Will the new bicycle bring his life back on track, or will he and his family keep compromising on necessities and life\u2019s simple pleasures?\n\nCast[edit]\nPrakash Jha[5]\nAnita Choudhary\nAarohi Sharma\nIdhika Roy\nDimpy Mishra\nChandra Prakash Sharma\nAyaan Madaar\nAryan Madaar\nKaleem Zafar\nGaurav Chaturvedi\nRelease and Reception[edit]\nMatto Ki Saikil was released theatrically on 16 September 2022.[6][7]\nThe movie received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On IMDB, it has a rating of 8.9 out of 10. Critics praised Jha's performance while questioning the pacing and screenplay of the film. Dhaval Roy for The Times of India wrote \"The bicycle symbolises the cyclical poverty that Matto is stuck in. M Gani\u2019s direction is good, but the movie seems to stretch unnecessarily, and not much happens... Prakash Jha and all the other actors get the twang and dialect perfectly but it also becomes tough to follow the dialogue and loses its charm after a point\", while rating the movie 3 out of 5.[8] Shubhra Gupta, giving a similar rating for The Indian Express observed, \"The film observes its characters going about their business, inviting us to be participants, and we are happy to ride along, like Matto does\".[9]\nNDTV's Saibal Chatterjee observed with a more positive review that, \"On the big screen, we hardly ever get to see those who toil to construct our houses, lay our roads, and produce the goods we buy and the food we eat. In a modest, minimalist manner, Matto Ki Saikil trains the spotlight on the pitiable reality of India's unorganized labour force.\", rating the movie 3.5 out of 5.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Prakash Jha: 'Matto Ki Saikil' represents half of the country's population\".
