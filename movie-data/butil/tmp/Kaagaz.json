The spiritual sequel Kaagaz 2 was released to positive reviews on March 1 2024.[7]\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nThe film depicts the struggle and fight of Bharat Lal Bihari against the Indian bureaucracy who was declared dead on government records, his fight with the government went on for 19 years.\n\nCast[edit]\nPankaj Tripathi[8] as Bharatlal Bihari\nMonal Gajjar as Rukmanii\nSatish Kaushik as Advocate Sadhoram Kewat\nMita Vashisht as MLA Asarfi Devi\nBrijendra Kala as Highcourt Judge\nAmar Upadhyay as MLA Vidhayak Jaganpal Singh\nLankesh Bhardwaj as Sr. Inspector\nNeha Chauhan as Journalist Sonia\nGarrvil Mohan as Pablo\nPranay Narayan as Devilal\nAmit Pathak as Harilal\nSharat Sonu as Rampal\nRatan Lal as Motiya\nMahesh Chandra Deva as typist\nArun Shekhar as Chaman Lal\nDinesh Sharma as Panditji Pandey\nYogesh Kumar Shukla as Shukla Ji\nSandeepa Dhar Special appearance in Laalam Laal song[9]\nAjay Singh as Tyagi peshkaar of High court judge\nLal Bihari in a cameo appearance as the man cycling beside Bharatlal\nSoundtrack[edit]\nKaagazSoundtrack album by Pravesh Mallick, Rahul Jain and ceAzerReleased6 January 2021[10]Recorded2018\u201319GenreFeature film soundtrackLength24:26LanguageHindiLabelSalman Khan Films\nThe film's music was composed by Pravesh Mallick, Rahul Jain and ceAzer while lyrics written by Aseem Ahmed Abbasee, Rashmi Virag, Kunaal Vermaa and Shweta Raj.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Laalam Laal\"Aseem Ahmed AbbaseePravesh MallickRajnigandha Shekhawat4:212.\"Bailgadi\"Rashmi ViragPravesh MallickUdit Narayan, Alka Yagnik4:283.\"Jug Jug Jiyo\"Aseem Ahmed Abbasee, Kunaal VermaaRahul JainRahul Jain4:574.\"Jug Jug Jiyo\" (Reprise)Aseem Ahmed Abbasee, Kunaal VermaaRahul JainRahul Jain5:145.\"Bulaave\"Shweta RajceAzerPapon3:566.\"Poetry of Kaagaz\"Aseem Ahmed AbbaseeRahul JainSalman Khan, Rahul Jain2:30Total length:24:26\nRelease[edit]\nIt premiered on 7 January 2021 on ZEE5.[1]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical reception[edit]\nManoj Vashisth of Dainik Jagran[11] and Neeraj Verma of Navbharat Times[12] had given the film three and half stars out of five. Akanksha Sridhara of Xappie[13] also gives three and half stars out of five to the film.\nPallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India[14] had given the film three stars out of five by summing with 'Kaagaz' could have been the go-to movie for those seeking a burst of inspiration, but it ends up being a uni-dimensional masterclass on one man's acting prowess\".\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV[15] had given the film three stars concluding \"Satish Kaushik plays a more extended role with customary aplomb. It is however left to Pankaj Tripathi to keep Kaagaz afloat even when it appears to be wilting a touch under the burden of its solemn purpose. He doesn't let the film down.\"\nGautaman Bhaskaran of News18[16] had given the film two and half stars out of five stating that Kaagaz is a satire narrated with sincerity and passion, and takes on the bureaucracy by its horns, so to say. The film is a movingly powerful reflection of how India's poor continue to be treated even today \u2013 almost 74 years after the country won its independence from decades of foreign dominance, first by the Mughals and then British. In a way, India's poor, most of whom live away from urban conglomerations, remain as poor as they were and still face the brunt of a largely unfeeling and corrupt administration.\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee / work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2021\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nBest Web Original Film\n\nKaagaz\n\nNominated\n\n[17]\n\n\nBest Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nPankaj Tripathi\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nSatish Kaushik\n\nNominated\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Pankaj Tripathi's 'Kaagaz' to release on ZEE5 in January\".\n\n^ \"Satish Kaushik's next directorial titled 'Kaagaz'\".\n\n^ \"Salman Khan to produce Satish Kaushik's directorial Kagaz\".\n\n^ \"Salman Khan lends his voice for the first time for a pensive poem in Pankaj Tripathi starrer Kaagaz; WATCH\".
