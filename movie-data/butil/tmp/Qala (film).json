Viswanath's Swathi Kiranam, and Milo\u0161 Forman's Amadeus.[8]\nAt the 2023 Filmfare OTT Awards, Qala received 6 nominations, including Best Web Original Film, Best Actress in a Web Original Film (Dimri) and Best Supporting Actress in a Web Original Film (Mukherjee), and won Best Production Design (Web Original Film) (Meenal Agarwal).\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nSet in 1940s, Qala is about the tumultuous relationship between an aspiring singer and her domineering mother.\nThe movie begins with Qala Manjushree who has just won the \"Golden Vinyl\". She is being interviewed by several journalists who mention her brother. Distraught, Qala replies that she does not have a brother. In a flashback, her mother Urmila, who was pregnant with twins, gives birth to Qala, but her stillborn brother does not survive. In a fit of rage, Urmila attempts to smother Qala.\nUrmila teaches Qala the art of music but warns her against being a courtesan. Qala is haunted by visions of her brother who accuses her of taking what is rightfully his, for which a doctor advises her to rest. In another flashback, Qala is being taught music for a performance in 3 days but Urmila chides her and accuses her of not working hard enough. To punish her, Urmila locks Qala out in the snow. At the performance, few people show up and Qala is upstaged by an orphan, Jagan. Urmila takes a liking to his music and brings him home to live with her, to the dismay of Qala, who is jealous of him. In the present, a renowned singer, Sanyal, dies. It is revealed that her mother seduced Sanyal to obtain a chance for Jagan to sing with him. To further Jagan's career, Urmila attempts to marry Qala off but she refuses. Urmila hosts a party and invites several influential people. At the party, Qala feels invisible but is noticed by Sanyal, whom she kisses.\nJagan falls sick and cannot sing so Qala sings instead, impressing the guests. Jagan's sickness worsens to the point of being unable to sing but is cared for by Urmila. Qala seduces Sumant Kumar to obtain a chance at recording a song, taking Jagan's place. That night Jagan talks to Qala one last time before he hangs himself in the forest. The next day, Qala discovers his body and hugs his corpse. Her mother is distraught and cradles Jagan in her hands. Urmila and Qala have a fight during which Qala calls Urmila a courtesan, after which she forbids Qala from coming back to their house ever again. Qala leaves for Calcutta for her recording session. She is nervous and cannot sing even on the 11th take. For a last chance, she is forced to provide oral pleasure to Sumant. She recalls Jagan, who said that he always sung for himself. Using this mindset, she successfully records the song. Qala slowly rises to fame as a singer, becoming close with Majrooh, the songwriter who advises her to cease her arrangement with Sumant.\nWhile being interviewed by journalists again, she sees another vision of Jagan. While recording a song, she breaks down and sees snow falling all around her. Her mother hears her interview being broadcast over the radio. In a flashback, Qala is shown dropping a globule of mercury into Jagan's milk before his performance, leading to his sickness. She attempts to kill herself by overdosing on sleeping pills. Her doctor calls her mother and informs her of Qala's suicide attempt. Her mother comes to Calcutta to visit her, but finds that she has hanged herself. Later, she tearfully listens to Qala's vinyl which Qala had sent to her in Tanuku.\n\nCast[edit]\nTripti Dimri as Qala Manjushree\nAadhya Jha as 10 year old Qala\nSwastika Mukherjee as Urmila \"Urmi\" Manjushree[9]\nBabil Khan as Jagan Batwal\nAmit Sial as Sumant Kumar\nSameer Kochhar as Chandan Lal Sanyal\nGirija Oak as Sudha\nSwanand Kirkire as Mansoor Khan Sahab\nTasveer Kamil as Naseeban Appa\nVarun Grover as Majrooh\nVeera Kapur EE as Rani Mandira\nAbhishek Banerjee as Dr. Banerjee\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was announced by Netflix on 10 April 2021, Tripti Dimri was cast in the title role, and was joined by Babil Khan.[10][11][12][13] The film marks the second collaboration between Tripti Dimri, Anvita Dutt and Clean Slate Filmz after Bulbbul (2020).[14]\nPrincipal photography started in April 2021, in Kashmir.[15][16] Filming was completed in October 2021.[17][18]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nQalaSoundtrack album by Amit Trivedi, Sagar DesaiReleased24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)[19]Recorded2021GenreFeature film soundtrackLength25:24LanguageHindiLabelNetflix, Sony Music India\nThe music for the film was composed by Amit Trivedi, the background score was composed by Sagar Desai, while guest-composed one song \"Udh Jaayega\" and lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Swanand Kirkire, Varun Grover and Kausar Munir.

From Amit Trivedi\u2019s music to Siddharth Diwan\u2019s cinematography, Qala weaves a beautiful but harrowing and tragic tale of loss, grief, and desire that starts off in the snowy moors of Shimla and ends in a burnished manor of Calcutta.\"[39]\nRenuka Vyavahare of The Times of India wrote, \"A fictitious period drama about a playback singer, Qala treads an unfamiliar, unspoken path in terms of relationships. It looks beyond the obvious to explore the underlying complexities of a mother-daughter equation, a rare sight in Hindi cinema. The latter has either overlooked or villainised the conflict for the gallery. Qala dares to observe the raw, even ugly insides of a seemingly normalised relationship with heart aching longing and regret at its core.\"[40]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee / work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2023\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nBest Web Original Film\n\nQala\n\nNominated\n\n[41]\n\n\nBest Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nTriptii Dimri\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nSwastika Mukherjee\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Background Music (Web Original Film)\n\nSagar Desai\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design (Web Original Film)\n\nMeenal Agarwal\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Cinematographer (Web Original Film)\n\nSiddharth Diwan\n\nNominated\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Netflix original films\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Psychological drama 'Qala' to release on Dec 1\".
