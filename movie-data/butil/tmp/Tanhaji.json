Tracing the life of Maratha warrior Tanaji Malusare, it stars Ajay Devgn as the eponymous lead, Kajol and Saif Ali Khan. It also features Neha Sharma, Sharad Kelkar and Luke Kenny in supporting roles.[6] Set in the 17th century, it revolves around Tanaji's attempts to recapture the Kondhana fortress once it passes on to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who transfers its control to his trusted guard Udaybhan Singh Rathore.\nThe film was originally named Tanaji: The Unsung Warrior but the name was later changed to Tanhaji.[7][8] The film was launched on 20 July 2017, with Raut making his directorial debut in Bollywood. Raut, who previously directed Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush (2015), for which he received acclaim, the film was simultaneously dubbed in Marathi following popular demand.[9] Principal photography commenced on 25 September 2018,[10][11] and completed within May 2019. Filming took in mostly across the Film City in Mumbai, and few scenes shot at Pune. The cinematography and editing were handled by Keiko Nakahara and Dharmendra Sharma. The background score was composed by Sandeep Shirodkar; the soundtrack album was composed by Ajay\u2013Atul, Sachet\u2013Parampara and Mehul Vyas and released under the label T-Series.\nTanhaji was released in India in 3D and conventional formats on 10 January 2020.[12] The film received wide critical and public praise for Devgn and Khan's performances, the visual effects, cinematography, action sequences, art direction, music, score, and editing.[13] The film grossed \u20b9367.65 crore (equivalent to \u20b9433\u00a0crore or US$54\u00a0million in 2023) worldwide and was declared a major success at the box office, thus becoming the highest grossing Hindi film of 2020 as well as highest grossing Indian film of 2020.[5] The film was selected as one of the Best Foreign Film to be screened at the 78th Golden Globe Awards.[14] At the 68th National Film Awards, the film won the awards for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, Best Actor (Devgn) and Best Costume Design. At the 66th Filmfare Awards, Tanhaji received 13 nominations, including Best Film and Best Actor (Devgn), and won 4 awards, including Best Director (Raut) and Best Supporting Actor (Khan).\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1647, Tanhaji's father, Kaloji Malusare, trains him in sword-fighting, only to succumb to a Mughal plunder in Umrat. 17 years later in 1664, a now-adult Tanhaji, with his younger brother Suryaji, commands Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maratha army to attack an intruding Mughal cavalry.\nIn 1665, the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, dispatches his uncle and trusted general, Maharaja of Amber, Jai Singh, to capture Shivaji, which will stop his rapid imperial expansion into the Deccan Plateau. He successfully captures Shivaji, alongside his 23 forts that are under his control, in the Battle of Purandar. Later the Mughal general, Beshak Khan, orders a quick seize of Shivaji's strategic fortress, Kondhana, insulting Jijabai, Shivaji's mother. She swears to remain barefoot until the Marathas recapture the fort. Tanhaji is informed about the treaty as well. Five years later, in 1670, Shivaji's spy informs him about Aurangzeb's plan to assign Kondhana to his Rajput general, Udaybhan Rathod, and use it as a base for Aurangzeb's southern imperial expansion. Shivaji plans to recapture Kondhana, considering himself to lead the campaign as Tanhaji, though an able general, cannot be employed due to his son, Rayba's upcoming wedding.\nMeanwhile, Tanhaji celebrates Holi with his family. The Marathas begin their preparations for war and Shivaji warns his generals to keep Tanhaji from knowing about the campaign. Tanhaji arrives at Rajgad, to invite Shivaji and Jijabai to Rayba's wedding. Chandraji Pisal, a Maratha general, who is attempting to usurp Shivaji's throne, discloses the secret plan to Tanhaji at his nephew, Chultya's recommendation. Tanhaji convinces Shivaji and Jijabai to permit him to lead the campaign, who reluctantly agree. He postpones Rayba's wedding.\nElsewhere, Udaybhan reaches Burhanpur, while the Marathas discuss the possibilities of his route. Tanhaji coins an attack plan, but Pisal sends Chultya to warn Udaybhan about the plan. Pisal schemes of sabotaging Tanhaji's mission and getting him killed, so that Shivaji would then appoint him in-charge of the campaign. Pisal intends to become influential enough to overthrow Shivaji and join hands with Udaybhan. Udaybhan is also bringing the imprisoned Kamla Devi, en route, the sister of his Rajput general, Jagat Singh. Chultya informs Udaybhan about Tanhaji's plan. He successfully tricks Tanhaji into attacking Maratha soldiers disguised in Mughal attire. Elsewhere, Udaybhan reaches Kondhana and aims a huge cannon, named Naagin, at Rajgad, threatening Shivaji's safety. Dejected, Tanhaji reaches Kondhana alone to learn about a secret thief-entrance inside. Udaybhan kills a guard for disobeying the security protocol. Tanhaji recovers the remains of the guard and motivates the villagers to retaliate against Udaybhan.\nHe is invited to participate in Shivratri celebrations, on Kondhana, where he kills Chultya for betraying the Marathas. Tanhaji is imprisoned and tortured by Udaybhan, as a result. Jagat Singh secretly releases Tanhaji, revealing Udaybhan's plan to marry his sister. Tanhaji promises to release them from Udaybhan's clutches. Tanhaji escapes from the thief-entrance and returns to Umrat where he informs his people about the upcoming war. Savitri Bai, Tanhaji's wife, worries about her husband's life and son's impending wedding. Tanhaji convinces Savitri Bai that the campaign will be a success for the Marathas, to which she replies by asking him what he wants from her, when he returns from the campaign. Tanhaji makes Savitri Bai promise to him that she will don Marathi bridal attire, while waiting for him.\nUdaybhan hangs the guards responsible for Tanhaji's escape and Jagat Singh agrees to get Kamla Devi married to him, on Ashtami's eve. He convinces her to fake the wedding preparations until Tanhaji and his army arrive. Tanhaji now plans to directly attack Kondhana during Ashtami night on 4 February 1670. He scales the fort through various entrances and begins the attack on the Mughal army. The ensuing confusion allows Jagat and Kamla Devi to escape. Udaybhan is alerted, who prepares to fire Naagin directly at Rajgad.\nTanhaji and his army wipe out most of the Mughal soldiers. Just as Udhaybhan lights Naagin, Tanhaji arrives on horseback to stop the cannon from being fired. Though successful, Udhaybhan hacks off Tanhaji's arm in the process, gravely injuring him. With his remaining strength, Tanhaji fights Udhaybhan to death. It culminates with Tanhaji tying Udhaybhan to Naagin and pushing it off a cliff, ending Udhaybhan's brief reign. Before collapsing from his injuries, he plants the flag of the Marathas, successfully capturing Kondhana. Shivaji and his army arrive and conquer Kondhana, but Shivaji ends up breaking into tears over Tanhaji's death, uttering \"Gad Aala, Pan Sinh Gela\" (the fort has been captured, but we lost the lion). Later, Shivaji personally oversees Rayba's marriage, while Savitri Bai fulfill's her promise to Tanhaji by adorning herself as a bride behind closed doors, as she awaits his return. Aurangzeb's aim of ruling southern India remained unfilled for 18 years, until he himself came to try to claim it from the Marathas.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAjay Devgn as Subhedar Tanaji Malusare\nKajol as Savitri Bai\nSaif Ali Khan as Udaybhan Singh Rathore\nSharad Kelkar as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj\nNeha Sharma as Kamla Devi\nLuke Kenny as Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb\nVipul Gupta as Jagat Singh\nPadmavati Rao as Rajmata Jijabai\nElakshi Gupta as Soyarabai\nSanjay Mishra as Narrator\nShashank Shende as Shelaar\nDevdatta Nage as Suryaji Malusare\nAjinkya Deo as Chandraji Pisal\nYuri Suri as Mirza Raja Jai Singh\nJagannath Nivangune as Kaloji Malusare\nTrisha Patil as Parvati Bai\nHardik Sangani as Gondya\nNissar Khan as Beshak Khan\nPrasanna Ketkar as Ghersarnaik\nKailash Waghmare as Chultiya\nHarsh Sharma as Young Tanaji\nRanav Sharma as Young Suryaji\nArush Nand as Rayaba Malusare\nDhairyasheel Gholap as Shrubhau\nNilesh Lalwani as Tatya\nPramod More as Leader of Gondia\nBhagyashree Nhalve as Suryaji's wife\nDevendra Gaikwad as Rayaba's father-in-law\nRajesh Ahir as Raja Sangram Singh\nAngad Mhaskar as Pant\nNikhat Khan as Udaybhan's mother\nAntima Sharma as Nafeesa\nNiranjan Jadhao as Trimbak Rao\nShivraj Walvekar as Pratap Rao\nRajveer Ankur Singh as Khaibar Khan\nRamchandran Singh as Raja Kaka\nMyrah Dandekar as Rayaba's wife\nTufali Khan as Munawar Khan\nMridul Kumar as Noor Khan Baig\nSandeep Juwatkar as Gujar\nAjay Kumar Nain as Rajput Vakil\nRakesh Bhavsar as peshwa\nNitesh Kalbande as Divya Malusare\nTareeq Ahmed Khan as Mughal Soldier\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nAfter completing his work on the directorial venture Shivaay (2016), Ajay Devgn, announced his next film on 29 July 2016, titled Sons of Sardaar: Battle of Saragarhi,[15][16] a big-budget war film based on the 1897 Saragarhi battle between 21 Sikhs and 10,000 Afghans.[17] Made on a huge scale, Devgn planned to start the production work in late 2016, and decided to release the film on Diwali next year;[18] However, when Karan Johar announced Kesari, another film based on the battle of Saragarhi, Devgn decided to postpone the project after September 2017.[19] In late February 2019, it was reported that Devgn had shelved the project.[20]\nMeanwhile, Ajay Devgn, decided to do another period film with Om Raut, based on the life of Maratha warrior Tanaji Malusare,[21] which was titled officially as Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior.[22] The first look of Taanaji was released on 20 July 2017,[23] through Devgn's official Twitter account,[24] and pre-production work commenced the following day. In August 2017, a report from Asian Age, claimed that the film will also be made simultaneously in Marathi language, due to the demand of the story, and also Raut's popularity in Marathi, after the success of Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush (2015).[25]\nA source claimed that the film's pre-production work will go on for 6\u20138 months, and Ajay Devgn will start the shoot of the film in March 2018.[26] However, the team undertook heavy VFX works for the film for 6\u20138 months, and Devgn's NY VFXWAALA was brought on board for the film,[27] whereas filmmakers planned to release the film in 3D formats, thus delaying the film's shoot to September 2018.[28] On 2 August 2018, Bhushan Kumar of T-Series,[29] undertook the project in collaboration with Ajay Devgn's production company and planned to start the shoot in end of September.[30] In March 2019, the film's title Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior was changed to Tanhaji,[31] due to numerological reasons.[32][33]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn October 2018, Kajol was reported to play the role of Taanaji's wife in the film.[34][35] In January 2019, Saif Ali Khan was reported to play the role of Udaybhan Singh Rathore, one of the main antagonists of the film.[36] For his role, Khan had to prepare for sword fighting and horse-riding, as a part of the character, In an interview with Mid-Day, he stated \"A chunk of the research has been done by Om, who has done a thorough job. Since it is an action-packed film, I was required to look leaner. I had to be adept in horse riding. The fact that I was coming straight off Navdeep's [Singh] film (Laal Kaptaan) made it easier. The physical prep has been rigorous for this film.\"[37]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on 25 September 2018,[38] with a muhurat shot given by Om Raut.[39][40] The film's first schedule was commenced in October 2018, with Kajol filming her portions in Mumbai.[41]\nTanhaji was filmed mainly at the Film City in Mumbai. Director Om Raut claimed that in the movie, the visual effects have played a major part. The director also said that making the Sandhan Valley set was the biggest challenge for them. The makers had to create a 300-foot (91\u00a0m) long set to make it look like the Sandhan Valley.[citation needed] In the making video of the film, Raut stated: \"Creating the 300-foot (91\u00a0m) long gorge inside a theatre was extremely difficult,\" adding that the production designers \"went and took moulds of the stones and rocks which are there in the valley and they built a wall. And what we did in the effects after that is we put in effects on it.\"[42]\nThe team of the film also shot some parts at Chitrakoot Ground in Andheri. Some parts of the film were also filmed at Pune.[citation needed] In January 2019, the team kicked off a song shoot which has been mounted on a lavish scale and that a special set was erected for this number.[43] Kajol, however, shot for this number last year, in the last week of December. As the song was so elaborate that the shooting schedule for the same was as long as a week and the number will feature some amazing diya and rangoli setup representing that era. Keeping in the mind the period that the film is set up in, Kajol sported wearing a traditional Maharashtrian outfit in the song.[43]\nIn March 2019, a source claimed that 60% of the shoot was completed, and the team took a break, after Devgn being busy for the promotions of his film Total Dhamaal (2019).[44] In April 2019, a climax shoot featuring Devgn and Khan was filmed in a huge scale, and the stunt sequence was choreographed by Ramazan Bulut, who worked in the stunt department for Hollywood films Rush (2013) and Inferno (2016).[45] The principal photography wrapped up in May 2019.[45]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nTanhajiSoundtrack album by Ajay\u2013Atul, Sachet\u2013Parampara Mehul Vyas and Prasenjit KosambiReleased8 January 2020[46]Recorded2018\u20132019GenreFilmiLength17:27LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesExternal audio Official Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThe film's soundtrack album was composed by Ajay\u2013Atul, Sachet\u2013Parampara Mehul Vyas and Prasenjit Kosambi with lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire Anil Verma and Abhijit Kosambi.

They had also taken objection to the dialogues of Kajol who plays the role of Savitribai Malusare.[58] The organization had also demanded a special screening of the film ahead of its release.[59] Later, Nationalist Congress Party leader Jitendra Ahwad, threatened the makers of the film to make several changes to the trailer of the film,[60] also accused filmmaker Om Raut of depicting history inaccurately and unethically and showing the Maratha warrior Tanaji Malusare in a wrong way.[61][62] The Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Koli Rajput Sangh had filed a petition in Delhi High Court on 13 December 2019, claiming that its director Om Raut has concealed the true lineage of the great warrior Tanaji Malusare in the movie.[63][64] In January 2020, the Central Board of Film Certification deleted controversial references in the film, and ensured multiple disclaimers in the beginning to avoid controversies.[65]\nTanhaji opened up to 4,540 screens worldwide, which included 3,880 screens in 3D and conventional formats in Hindi and Marathi versions and 660 screens overseas.[66] A day before its release, the makers premiered a special screening of the film on 9 January,[67] featuring Devgn and his family, along with the cast and crew.[68] Later on 13 January, Devgn hosted special screening of the film, for 600 school children at the Inox Megaplex in Mumbai, to know about the history of Tanaji Malusare.[69] Another special screening was held on 20 January for the army and navy officials.[70] The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation had tied up an association with the Directorate of Tourism and the film's team to attract tourists to know about the history of Tanaji Malusare and its legacy.[71] The film was declared tax-free in Uttar Pradesh,[72] Haryana[73] and Maharashtra.[74] This film was also released dubbed in Marathi-language following popular demand.[9]\nTanhaji's world television premiere took place on 26 July 2020 at Star Plus,[75] and registered 1.2 crore impressions on its first airing.[76] The film released on Disney+ Hotstar on 6 March 2020.[77]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of 12 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10.[78]\nA review over the Hindustan Times noted it to be a magnificent work, which had exceptional individual performances, a captivating story-line and excellent virtual effects.[79] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu noted of the film to have started off well, before floundering in the middle but regaining brilliance at the end, delivering a catharsis and adrenaline rush.[80] Uday Bhatia of The Mint noted it to be a silly cartoon history, which borrowed its physics from Prince of Persia, but nonetheless consisted of fluent actions and interesting individual performances.[81] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV noted it to be a historically inauthentic work that ironed out any and all nuances in its portrayal of a saffronized Hindu-Muslim binary; however, he noted the overall production to be crisp and backed by powerful individual performances.[82] Tanul Thakur of The Wire noted it to be a work that had excellent cinematography but was intensely buoyed down by its ahistorical religio-nationalist propaganda, catering to the overall saffronization of India.[83]\nShubhra Gupta over The Indian Express noted it to offer a \"simplistic, dressed-up slice of the past\" that painted hyperbolic tales of Maratha bravery with a Hindu fervor.[84] Sukanya Verma of Rediff noted it to be a mythical retelling of history with a bout of saffron fervor; individual performances and choreography of combat sequences were praised.[85] Rajeev Masand noted it to be a dubiously stereotyped fictional work, which appealed to the hyper-nationalistic climate but had robust filmography, visceral battle scenes, and superb individual performances.[86] A critic from The Economic Times praised the visual effects, computer graphics and editing of the film, making it a must-watch film.[87] Stutee Ghosh of The Quint noted it to be a visually stunning film with strong individual performances, despite its broad liberties with historical accuracy and problematic prejudices.[88] Jyoti Kanyal of India Today gave two-and-a-half out of five stars stating \"Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is an exaggerated and slow-paced ode to the great Maratha warrior Tanaji Malusare.\"[89]\nWriting for the Firstpost, Devanesh Sharma gave two-and-a-half out of five stars and praised Kajol and Khan's performance while criticizing Devgn's characterization as the review stated \"The leading man, though undoubtedly an unsung warrior, as the title suggests, comes across as rather one-dimensional, as Devgn fails to take his character beyond the written word.\"[90] Harshada Rege of The Times of India gave four out of five stars and stated \"Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior scores on various counts \u2013 superior performances, powerful action, visual impact, and most of all, it unfolds a story from the pages of history that deserved to be told, with just this kind of intensity, passion and vigor.\"[91] Sify gave the film 3 out of 5 stars stating \"Tanhaji is substantially enriched by its technical crew that has worked to create a splendid canvas for the cast to shine upon. It tells the story of a lesser known hero from the chapters of Indian history, which makes this an intriguing film.\"[92]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times wrote in her review stating \"Tanhaji is a complete package. It\u2019s magnificent, high on visual effects and has powerful action backed by rock solid performances.\"[93] Rohit Vats of News18 gave three-and-a-half out of five stars stating \"Devgn and Khan ensure that the viewers get enough dose of high-voltage dialogues, along with fascinating action scenes.\"[94] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll stated \"Tanhaji loudly sings its hero\u2019s praises, creating a spectacle that is thrilling when in battle mode and troubling when considering the dynamic between the Marathas and the Mughals.\"[95]\nAvinash Ramachandran of The New Indian Express gave three out of five stars stating \"In Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, we get to see iconic warriors of India shed tears copiously. We get to see jingoism masked as Maratha valor. There are a lot of things going for Tanhaji, but, deep inside, it is unsettling to see such polarizing historical dramas.\"[96] A critic from Bollywood Hungama rated four out of five stars and stated Tanhaji is an entertaining and a paisa-vasool film that would be loved by the masses as well as classes.[97] Suparna Sharma of Deccan Chronicle gave three out of five stars stating \"Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, whose plot is essentially a march towards the battle, is not a bad film. It is, in fact, quite entertaining when it is at war.\"[98] A critic from Daily News and Analysis gave three out of five stars stating \"Watch it for the magnificent performances by Kajol and Khan who clearly outshine this Devgn-led vehicle.\"[99]\n\nBox office[edit]\nTanhaji earned \u20b915.10 crore (US$2.04 million) at the domestic box office on its opening day. On the second day, the film collected \u20b920.57 crore (US$2.78 million). On the third day, the film collected  \u20b926.26 crore (US$3.54 million), taking total opening weekend collection to \u20b9619.3\u00a0million \u20b961.93 crore (US$8.36 million).[5][100] On the fourth day (13 January), the film collected \u20b913.75 crore (US$1.86 million), and film's collection stood at \u20b975.63 crore (US$10.21 million).[101] On the fifth day (14 January), the collection stood much higher after the long holiday weekend owing to Makar Sankranti and the film collected \u20b915.28 crore (US$2.06 million), totalling the first five-day collection to \u20b990.96 crore (US$12.28 million).[102] On 15 January, the film hit the \u20b9100-crore mark,[103] as the six-day collections stood up to \u20b9107.68 crore (US$14.53 million).[104][105] At the end of the first week (16 January),[106] the film collected \u20b9118.91 crore (US$16.05 million).[107] The film collected \u20b9128.97 crore (US$17.4 million), on the eighth day of its release,[108] with a strong opening on the second Friday.[109]\nThe film crossed the \u20b9150 crore mark on the tenth day of its release.[110][111] On 25 January, the film crossed the \u20b9200 crore mark,[112] as the overall collection stood up to \u20b9202.83 crore (US$27.37 million).[113] On 3 February, the film collected \u20b9250 crore (US$33.74 million) at the box office.[citation needed] At the end of its seventh week, the film collected \u20b9276.90 crore (US$37.37 million).[114] The film managed to earn \u20b9279.60 crore (US$37.73 million),[115] at the domestic box office, within 50 days of its release.[citation needed] As of 13 March 2020, with theatres closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film had accumulated \u20b9332.8 crore (US$44.91 million),[116] in India and \u20b934.85 crore (US$4.7 million) overseas,[116] thus collecting \u20b9367.65 crore (US$49.62 million) worldwide, it became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2020.[116][5]\n\nHistorical accuracy[edit]\nIn the final fight against Udaybhan Rathod, Tanhaji lost his shield, not his arm.[117] Tanhaji's brother Suryaji Malusare also fought bravely. Tanhaji never a threw stick at Chhtrapati Shivaji Maharaj as depicted in this film. This incident is inaccurate and has no historical backing. Tanhaji had high respect for Chhtrapati Shivaji and it is highly unlikely that he threw something to his king. In 17th century Maratha warriors used shields made up of the back of tortoise, they did not use shields made up of metals as shown in this movie. In one scene a barber helps Udaybhan but this incident has no historical truth. Tanhaji was never captured and held captive by Udaybhan Rathod as depicted in this film. Moreover, some sources reveal that Udaybhan was killed by Shelar Mama, and not by Tanhaji, as depicted in the movie.[118][119]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward[a]\n\nDate of ceremony[b]\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n27 March 2021\n\nBest Film\n\nAjay Devgn FFilms, T-Series\n\nNominated\n\n[120][121]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nOm Raut\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nAjay Devgn\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nSaif Ali Khan\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nPrakash Kapadia, Om Raut\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Dialogue\n\nPrakash Kapadia\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nKeiko Nakahara\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nSriram Kannan Iyengar, Sujeet Sawant\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nNachiket Barve, Mahesh Sheria\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Action\n\nRamazan Bulut, Rp Yadav\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Choreography\n\nGanesh Acharya \u2013 (\"Shankara Re Shankara\")\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Special Effects\n\nPrasad Sutar\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Background Score\n\nSandeep Shirodkar\n\nNominated\n\n\nIIFA Awards\n\n4 June 2022\n\nBest Film\n\nAjay Devgn FFilms, T-Series\n\nNominated\n\n[122]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nSaif Ali Khan\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Sound Design\n\nLochan Kanvinde\n\nWon\n\n\nNational Film Awards\n\n22 July 2022\n\nBest Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment\n\nAjay Devgn FFilms\n\nWon\n\n[123]\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nAjay Devgn[c]\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nNachiket Barve & Mahesh Sherla\n\nWon\n\nSocial impact[edit]\nTanhaji became the highest most-rated film of the year, at a survey report by Book My Show.[125] A report from Google Trends, stated that the film is the third most searched films of Google.[126][127] The film was selected as one of the Best Foreign Film to be screened at the 78th Golden Globe Awards which was held in January 2021.[128]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Awards, festivals and organizations are in alphabetical order.\n\n^ Date is linked to the article about the awards held that year, wherever possible.\n\n^ shared with Suriya for Soorarai Pottru (2020).[124]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Tanhaji (2020)\".
