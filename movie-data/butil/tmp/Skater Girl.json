The cast includes newcomers Rachel Sanchita Gupta and Shafin Patel, and also stars Amrit Maghera, Jonathan Readwin and Waheeda Rehman. It was written by Manjari and Vinati Makijany, who co-produced the film through their Indian production company Mac Productions.[3] It was released on 11 June 2021 by Netflix.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn the present day in a remote village called Khempur near Udaipur in Rajasthan, teenager Prerna is living a life bound by tradition and duty to her parents.\nWhen London-bred advertising executive Jessica arrives in the village to learn more about her late father's childhood, Prerna and the other local children are introduced to an exciting new adventure thanks to Jessica and her old friend Erick who cruises into town on a skateboard.\nThe kids become infatuated with the sport, skating through the village, disrupting everything and everyone around them.\nDetermined to empower and encourage their newfound passion, Jessica sets out on an uphill battle to build the kids their own skatepark, leaving Prerna with a difficult choice between conforming to society's expectations of her or living out her dream of competing in the National Skateboarding Championships.\n\nCast[edit]\nRachel Sanchita Gupta as Prerna\nShraddha Gaikwad as Gunjan\nAmrit Maghera as Jessica\nWaheeda Rehman as Maharani\nShafin Patel as Ankush\nAnurag Arora as Mahesh\nJonathan Readwin as Erick\nSwati Das as Shanti\nAnkit Rao as Vikram\nAmbrish Saxena as Ramkesh\nVivek Yadav as Tipu\nSohan Suhalka as Vishwinath\nSahidur Rahaman as Police Officer\nProduction[edit]\nProduction of the film under the title Desert Dolphin took place in Khempur, a village near Udaipur, Rajasthan which was also the location for the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. As the central set of the film, the producers built Rajasthan's first and India's largest skatepark in Khempur. The film brought together crew from the US, Canada and India.[5] Production on the film completed in early 2020.[6]\nThe production employed approximately five hundred cast and crew including over three hundred and fifty village locals. Over three thousand children were auditioned, many of them skaters from skate communities across India.[7] The filmmakers spent over a year researching, writing and meeting with teenage girls and boys in Rajasthan to write Prerna and Ankush\u2019s characters as authentically as possible. Fifty-five skaters from across India featured in the movie including thirty-four local skaters from Khempur.[8]\n[9]\nPost Production was completed in Los Angeles at Warner Bros. facilities.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released by Netflix on 11 June 2021.[10][4]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical reception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of 18 critics\u2019 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.[11]\n\nWriting for RogerEbert.com, critic Sheila O\u2019Malley said the film \u201ccaptures the iconoclastic freedom and rebellion skateboarding has so often represented, and it joins a long line of rousing skate films.\u201d O\u2019Malley added,Newcomer [Rachel Sanchita] Gupta is a revelation, as is [Shafin] Patel, who plays her mischievous and sweet younger brother. Both understand all of the complexities of this story and give beautiful and powerful performances. There may be one too many obstacles placed in Prerna's way\u2026stacking the deck against her so there will be an even bigger payoff. But overall \"Skater Girl\" is so gratifying it doesn't matter.[12]\nSource of inspiration[edit]\nFollowing the release of the film's trailer, netizens familiar with the story of Ulrike Reinhard's skatepark and Asha Gond's rise as one of India's top skateboarders, found similarities between the movie and Gond's life.[13] While Gond was auditioned for the film, director Makijany denied that the movie was about Gond stating, \"the film is not a biopic based on anyone's life story nor is it a documentary. It is not Gond or Reinhard's story.\"[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Skater Girl (2021)\". British Board of Film Classification.
