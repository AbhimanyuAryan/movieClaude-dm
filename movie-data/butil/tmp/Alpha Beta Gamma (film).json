Shankar introduces a fresh twist to the classic theme of triangular relationships, relying heavily on how characters respond to various situations. He manages to keep viewers engaged, navigating the complexities adeptly. [1]\nDevesh Sharma of Filmfare gave 3.5/5 stars, called it a relationship hurricane and a modern take on urban relationships, and wrote \"Alpha Beta Gamma was shot amidst the pandemic with limited resources and that kind of works in the film\u2019s favour. The sound design is raw and minimal, and gives the feel of something captured inside an actual apartment, rather than being recreated in a studio. The camerawork helps create the feeling of claustrophobia. The characters and their quarrels, angst, as well as the stories they share with each other seem like something carved from life. The dialogue reeks of real conversations.\"[22]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\n\nInternational Film Festival of India\n\n24 November 2021[23]\n\nFeature Film - Indian Panorama[24]\n\n\nAmerta Festival [25]\n\n24 September 2021\n\nFeature Film\n\n\nTasveer South Asian Film Festival[26]\n\n16 November 2022\n\nFeature Film\n\n\nREAKTOR International Film Festival[27]\n\n19 September 2023\n\nFeature Film\n\n\nREAKTOR International Film Festival\n\n19 September 2023\n\nBest Actor\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Unique and engaging stories create stars: Director of 'Alpha Beta Gamma' Shankar Srikumar at IFFI52\". pib.gov.in.
