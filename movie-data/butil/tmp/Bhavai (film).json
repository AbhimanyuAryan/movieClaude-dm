Praising the performance of Pratik Gandhi he wrote, \"[he] delivers a wonderful performance as Raja Ram [and] convincingly portrays the conflict and the myriad emotions of his character\". Appreciating the cinematography of Chirantan Das, he stated, \"cinematography is beautiful, pleasing to the eyes and enhances the scenes.\" Kotwani liked the music and said, \"Shabbir Ahmed\u2019s wonderful soundtrack inspired by Gujarati folk music, adds to the narrative.\" Concluding he opined, \"Bhavai also has some old-world charm: ... the treatment of opening credits with a golden touch to the black-and-white animation and ear-pleasing classical score.\"[8] Jai Arjun Singh reviewing for Firstpost gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Bhavai is a determinedly inoffensive work, almost to the point of being a soporific \u2013 and as harmless as a Kumbhkarna who has just swallowed that soporific.\"[9]  For The Indian Express, Shubhra Gupta gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 and stated, \"[The film] should have been an entertaining, thought-provoking watch, especially because it is done in the colourful folksy Bhavai style.\" Gupta further added, \"But the whole thing is so dated, with everyone being made to declaim loudly, that the tone the film wishes to achieve gets lost.\"[10] Joginder Tuteja of Rediff rated it 3 out of 5. He praised the performances but criticised the length and narrative.[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Raavan Leela teaser: Scam 1992 star Pratik Gandhi delivers powerful monologue as demon king, fan says 'what performance'\".
