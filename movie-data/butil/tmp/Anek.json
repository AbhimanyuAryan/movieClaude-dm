Thankfully, it isn't\".[23] Swati Chopra of The Quint rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Anek is preachy in parts, but the film has its heart in the right place and it could have done better if the film didn't feel rushed, leading to less clarity\".[24] Fengyen Chiu of Mashable rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Anek tries very hard to bring forth the problems of North-east people in India but the message doesn't quite reach properly\".[25]\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Anek is sharper playing principled dissenter than uninvited saviour of the North East.[26] Sukanya Verma of Rediff rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"There's too much going on in Anek, and a lot of it is terribly disjointed\".[27] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Ayushmann Khurrana and the film stay woolly, being careful to stay in the middle of the while-on-the-one-side, but-also tightrope. Anubhav Sinha dips his toe into relatively unexplored territory, with mixed results\".[28] Bharathi Pradhan of Lehren rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The cinematic effort to mainstream the North-East, ends up in a mess that further alienates instead of integrating\".[29] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Visually spectacular, politically blurred, well-meaning and yet Anek fails to reach out across the barrier of the screen\".[30] Umesh Punwani of Koimoi rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Anubhav Sinha had so much to showcase, but he chose the wrong platform to do so\".[31] Monika Rawal Kukreja of The Hindustan Times stated \"Anubhav Sinha's latest political-social drama starring Ayushmann Khurrana fails to keep up with the expectations sets by Thappad, Mulk, Article 15\".[32]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear[a]\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2023\n\n68th Filmfare Awards\n\nBest Female Debut\n\nAndrea Kevich\u00fcsa\n\nWon\n\n[33]\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nEwan Mulligan\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Sound Design\n\nKaamod L Kharde\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Background Score\n\nMangesh Dhakde\n\nNominated\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Hindi films of 2022\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Refers to the year in which the ceremony was held.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Anek\".
