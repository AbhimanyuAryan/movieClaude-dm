Devi wants nothing to do with the family business and is in love with his childhood friend Parveen alias Pari, who is the daughter of his father\u2019s close associate Anwar. When Kalidas refuses to get involved in smuggling drugs with another drug lord Francis D'costa, an assassination attempt is made on him and Anwar becomes the suspect. Before proving his innocence, Anwar is killed by Kalidas's son-in-law Ranjeet Venkat Shankarnarayanan. Pari vows to avenge his death and swears on her unborn child that she will wipe out the entire Thakur bloodline, including Devi. \nWhile Kalidas is in coma, Devi takes over Kalidas' business and shuts down their illegal activities, where he kills Francis for attacking his father. Pari sides with Kalidas' rival Vishambhar Rana and sets out to annihilate the Thakur family. Ranjeet, who wants to take over Kalidas' position, sides with Rana to finish Kalidas, Devi and his brother Ramdas Thakur. Ranjeet gets thrashed by Ramdas for thrashing his wife and Ramdas's sister Rathna, where Ranjeet traps and kills Ramdas with a chainsaw. During a resulting gang war, Kalidas fakes his death and learns about Ranjeet and Rana's involvement in Anwar and Ramdas' death. \nRana makes Pari assume that Devi kidnapped her child Ishan, where Pari and Rana heads to the shrine where Devi is completing Kalidas' fake ritual. Despite injuries, Devi finishes Rana and clears the misunderstandings with Pari. Devi soon dies to his injuries, where Pari gets devastated and dies with Devi. Kalidas, Uma, Rathna and Ranjeet leave for Goa. Kalidas reveals Ranjeet's wrongdoings and Rathna kills him, where they burn down their car and leave to another city to start a new life.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nVidyut Jammwal as Devidas Thakur\nShruti Haasan as Parveen / Pari\nMahesh Manjrekar as Kaalidas Haridas Thakur\nJisshu Sengupta as Ramdas Thakur\nZakir Hussain as Anwar\nSachin Khedekar as Vishambhar Rana\nSonal Chauhan as Chandini\nMedha Manjrekar as Uma Kaalidas Thakur\nPrateik Babbar as Ranjeet Venkat Shankarnarayanan\nMrunmayee Deshpande as Ratna Thakur\nSudhanshu Pandey as Rocky\nYuvika Chaudhary as Shaila Thakur\nSalil Ankola as Robert\nSameer Dharmadhikari as Francis Dcosta\nChetan Hansraj as Fakira\nAham Sharma as Charlie\nVidyadhar Joshi as Bhau\nSavita Malpekar as Thakur's Maid\nGanesh Yadav as Potya\nAjay Purkar as Anna\nReception[edit]\nThe Power received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its acting, action sequences and technical aspects, but criticised its pace, script and direction.\n\nCritical response[edit]\nPallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"With a tighter, finer screenplay and more consistent performers, The Power could have been a befitting response of this decade to the Sarkar franchise, but a lacklustre narrative, among other things, brings the power down to level zero.\"[7] Joginder Tuteja of Rediff gave 2.5/5 stars and noted \"If the film had been crisper with solid drama in the second half too, The Power could have been more powerful.\"[8] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave 1.75/5 stars and wrote \"'The Power' is engaging to begin with, but as it rolls along it becomes clear that it falls in the \u2018if you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen \u2019em all\u2019 category of underworld dramas.\"[9] Samrudhi Ghosh of Hindustan Times wrote \"The Power, with its creative bankruptcy, brings nothing new to already done-to-death iterations of The Godfather.[10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe PowerSoundtrack album by Salim\u2013SulaimanReleased21 January 2021GenreFeature film soundtrackLength5:47LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanySalim\u2013Sulaiman chronology\n\n\nCoolie No.1(2020)\n\nThe Power(2021)\n\n\nOfficial audioThe Power - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music for the film was composed by Salim\u2013Sulaiman with lyrics written by Kumaar .
