They always pray to their close friend 'Raaka', a statue, to help them alleviate their poverty. They decide to host a ghost Halloween party. At midnight, Raaka's glowing eyes shut down. In the process of mending it, Major and Gullu are electrocuted and enter the realm of dead, where they meet Ragini, a benevolent ghost who promises to help them achieve their dream in return for a favour. Major and Gullu agree to the deal. The deal is to help attain moksha (salvation) for depraved souls by exposing the criminals who'd wronged them in life. In return, Ragini will help Major and Gullu earn money.\nInspired by her, the duo start a \"Phone Bhoot\" company and she helps them. Their business eventually grows and attains fame. Atmaram, an evil tantrik becomes jealous as Phone Bhoot is destroying his business and tries to destroy them but his efforts are thwarted by Ragini. Atmaram learns that Ragini is none other than the deceased lover of the late king Raja Dushyant Singh. Both were murdered in a car crash that was orchestrated by Atmaram himself in order to end Dushyant's reign as king. In the present, Atmaram captures Ragini in a bottle during the lunar eclipse when Ragini's powers are weakest. Major and Gullu feel deceived, realizing that Ragini manipulated them to seek revenge on Atmaram. Dushyant's soul is now held captive by Atmaram in his treasury of magic bottles.\nThe duo is confronted by another benevolent ghost that they'd previously helped with Ragini. This ghost reveals that Ragini is in dire trouble and requires their help in order to free many souls from Atmaram, including Dushyant's. Major and Gullu has a change of heart and confront Atmaram's, soon they are joined by their now animated Raaka, and free Ragini. Later other souls they have helped, liberated or helped attend salvation join them too in defeating Atmaram and throw him into the underworld's hellfire. Dushyant is now free. Ragini and Dushyant reunite in their metaphysical form and assure Major and Gullu that they'll help whenever it is needed.\nThe film ends with a hint of sequel.\n\nCast[edit]\nKatrina Kaif as Ragini Maheshwari\nIshaan Khatter as Galileo Parthasarthy aka Gullu\nSiddhant Chaturvedi as Sherdil Shergill aka Major\nNaufal Azmir Khan as Raghu Jadhav\nJackie Shroff as Atmaram Dhyani\nSheeba Chadha as Chikni Chudail\nNidhi Bisht as Lady Diana (Daayan)\nAnuksha Suguna Pushparaj as Lavanya\nManu Rishi Chadha\nArmaan Ralhan as Dushyant Singh\nPulkit Samrat as Hunny (cameo)\nVarun Sharma as Choocha (cameo)\nManjot Singh as Lali (cameo)\nManuj Sharma as Rahu\nShrikant verma as Ketu\nMohit Thakur as Jonny Dushman\nMD Abu Yousuf\nVipul Deshpande as Mr.Kulkarni\nSoundtrack[edit]\nPhone BhootSoundtrack album by Tanishk Bagchi, Rochak Kohli, Mikey McCleary and RoyReleased18\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-10-18)[9]Recorded2021-2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength16:19LabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioPhone Bhoot - Full Album on YouTubeSingles from  Phone Bhoot \n\"Kinna Sona\"Released: 13 October 2022\n\"Kaali Teri Gutt\"Released: 18 October 2022\n\n\nThe first song \"Kinna Sona\" released on 13 October 2022.[10] Sung by Tanishk Bagchi and Zahrah S Khan.

For that itself this one deserves a visit to the theatre\".[20] Nairita Mukherjee of India Today rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Bhoot is heavily dependent on Katrina Kaif and she honestly does her best to pull the film. Where she fails, the makers have strategically placed Ishaan and Siddhant, both known for their spunky comic timing, to add a redbull boost\".[21] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Bhoot is perhaps the silliest horror comedy you\"ll ever see\".[22] Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Bhoot has a fine first half with all the ingredients of a youthful, fun horror comedy. However, the second half could have been better. At the box office, the film will appeal to an audience who love horror\u00a0comedies\".[23] Soumyabrata Gupta of Times Now rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Bhoot\u00a0is a trippy horror ride which could have done better with a few more episodes on the chopping block.[24] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Booth\u00a0isn't an earth-shattering, game-changing deal for the genre but it has the feel of a full-on mad hatters' party where everything goes\".[25] Pratikshya Mishra of The Quint rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The film\u2019s own, original comedy, rarely works except when stars like Jackie Shroff and Sheeba Chaddha are at work\".[26] Sukanya Verma of Rediff rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Bhoot\u00a0would be a lot more memorable if it wasn't merely a costume ball doffing its hat at Hollywood, Bollywood,\u00a0Fukrey, Thalaivaa, a heroine who drinks mango juice like few can or a hero who can't stop playing his flute\".[27] Sanyukta Thakare of Mashable rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Phone Bhoot\u00a0isn't the perfect choice, but it is worth a watch for a chill-out session when you are tipsy with your friends\".[28]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Phone Bhoot\".
