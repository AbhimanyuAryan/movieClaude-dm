All that the film manages to do is leave the hopeful duo high and dry because it just doesn't get off the ground. It is a non-starter of a launchpad. Squad isn't all action. It has a couple of songs. One is picturized in a bar somewhere in Eastern Europe where the heroine shakes a leg to the beat of a desi song. The other is a romantic ditty that interrupts a sequence in which the hero and the heroine are in grave danger and decide to lose themselves in the labyrinths of love.\"[14]\nShubham Dwivedi from Pinkvilla gave a 2/5 rating and said, \"Malvika Raaj delivers a generic performance and it is difficult to shine in a film that is loaded with the ulterior motive of serving lousy mediocrity by writer and director Nilesh. Rinzing is monotone and bland like a potato. The screenplay is a fish out of the water and seizes to surprise. The mighty predictable and tacky action sequences are merely choreographed to fulfill the runtime. The characters don\u2019t have another dimension but the erratically misleading sense of jingoistic patriotism.\"[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Epic battle for climax of Rinzing Denzongpa's film Squad\".
