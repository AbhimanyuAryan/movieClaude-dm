The film stars Akshay Kumar and Emraan Hashmi in lead roles while Diana Penty and Nushrratt Bharuccha play supporting roles.[5] A remake of the 2019 Malayalam film, Driving Licence, the film revolves around a rivalry between an RTO Inspector and a prominent actor.\nFilming commenced in March 2022. It was theatrically released on 24 February 2023.[6] The film received mixed reviews from critics. However, the film was a huge commercial failure, earning only \u20b923.63 crore (US$3.0\u00a0million) at the box office.[7]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOm Prakash Aggarwal, a Motor Vehicle Inspector (MVI) based in Bhopal, is a passionate fan of film actor Vijay Kumar. Vijay is preparing to leave for the United States with his wife Naina to be present while the surrogate delivers their baby, delaying the filming of his next film \"Falak Tak\", which already incurred a budget overrun. With the climax still remaining to be shot at an Indian Navy leased land, the crew learns that Vijay's driving licence, that needs to be submitted to get clearance, is missing. The producer is outraged as the film has to be wrapped as soon as possible. Due to a clerical error while shifting between RTO buildings, Vijay cannot apply for a duplicate licence as issuing a new licence would take time. Hence, Vijay's politician friend meets Om for speeding the procedure. Om agrees to issue licence illicitly without Vijay even attending the test. In return, he summons Vijay to the RTO to meet him in person and as proof in case of an inquiry.\nMeanwhile, Vijay's professional rival Suraj Diwan is plotting to suppress competition from Vijay by means of occult. Even though he realises going to the RTO might give away clues for his visit, Vijay hesitatingly agrees, hoping that an unadvertised visit calls for less visibility. On his arrival, he sees TV channels surrounding the premises, amidst Vijay's peon Vimla gives a misinformation to a reporter that Vijay, an avid driver has been driving without a licence. The news spreads, and an infuriated Vijay scolds Om in front of his son and superiors for the leak and leaves. Angered, Om informs the reporters that Vijay was arrogant and wanted a licence without going through the normal procedures. Vijay's reputation has been severely damaged and to worsen the situation, Suraj's fans community head organises a hit-and-run attack on Om. He also has masked gang cast stones at his house and Om's son suffers a head injury, which makes Om to believe that Vijay 's  men were behind this.\nMeanwhile, Vijay reluctantly cancels his US trip on the producer's insistence. While rushing his son to the hospital, a frustrated Vijay calls Om by phone and threatens him, which affirms Om's conviction. On police inquiry, Om and his wife Minty accuse Vijay, but Vijay is not charged as his involvement was inconclusive. Protesting it, Om and his family perform Satyagraha in front of Vijay's residence, where media and fans also assemble. Addressing media, Vijay states that Om is a crazy fan and a kind of stalker who finds gratification by being a part in his idol's life through disruption. He shows Om's fan messages as evidence and announces that he has decided to attend the test in the supervision of Om. Vijay gets permission for an open test, which can be viewed by media and can be telecast live, the computer-based test is replaced with a direct question-answer session with Om. Om asks difficult and unusual questions, still Vijay manages to pass the learner's test.\nOm's son is bullied by Vijay's fan-boys in school. With that, Om decides not to send him to school until Vijay has failed and is determined to fail him using maximum discretion. Meanwhile, Naina requires a surgery, and a flight is charted to reach there as soon as the test is completed. On the practical assessment day, Vijay smoothly completes the \"H test\", but Om fails to him pointing petty mistakes. The decision is overruled by his superior and passes Vijay. Om makes Vijay wait until noon for the follow-up \"road test\". At noon, he postpones the test by two days, which happens to be the day of Naina's surgery. Vijay announces to the onlooking fans and media that he is forfeiting driving forever because Om has totally misused his power and he will retire from acting if this disrupts his life further. Enraged, the fans begin lynching Om, but Vijay saves him and flees from the place.\nWhile en route, they clear the misunderstandings. Om reveals that Vijay's licence was in the gift box which was thrown earlier by Vijay in RTO office. Vijay brings Om and his family to his house, where he scolds Suraj and Vimla for their mistakes. Two days later, before leaving to the airport Vijay interacts with the press about their reconciliation and tells that he has received his driving licence. Vijay then drives off in his car to the airport.\n\nCast[edit]\nAkshay Kumar as Vijay Kumar\nEmraan Hashmi as RTO Inspector Om Prakash Aggarwal\nDiana Penty as Naina Kumar, Vijay's wife\nNushrratt Bharuccha as Minty Aggarwal, Om's wife\nMahesh Thakur as Naveen\nMeghna Malik as Corporator Vimla Tiwari\nAbhimanyu Singh as Suraj Diwan\nAdah Sharma as Meera\nKusha Kapila as Tara\nMrunal Thakur as dancer in song \"Kudiyee Ni Teri Vibe\" (special appearance)\nYo Yo Honey Singh as himself in song \"Kudi Chamkili\" (special appearance)\nJacqueline Fernandez as dancer in song \"Deewane\" (special appearance)\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was announced in January 2022 (see below) with a motion poster by Dharma Productions.[8] Principal photography commenced in March 2022 in Mumbai and wrapped up in December 2022.[9][10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe music of the film is composed by Anu Malik, Tanishk Bagchi, Yo Yo Honey Singh, The PropheC, Lijo George-DJ Chetas, Vikram Montrose, Aditya Yadav and Tarun.
