It stars Tiger Shroff in a dual role alongside Kriti Sanon, Amitabh Bachchan, Elli AvrRam and Rahman.\nThe film was announced in November 2020 and underwent a long, heavy pre-production stage. Principal photography commenced in November 2021 and wrapped up in February 2023 with filming taking place in United Kingdom, Ladakh and Mumbai.\nGanapath was released theatrically on 20 October 2023 and received negative reviews from critics. The film was a major box office bomb.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn the year 2070, a destructive war leaves the world divided by a towering wall, with the rich people residing in a city called Silver City led by the Dalini, while the poor people survives in a destructed city and struggles for basic necessities as it was controlled by the Silver City.\nMeanwhile, Guddu resides in the Silver City and works for Dalini's henchmen John, who conducts boxing matches and earns money through the bets placed by the rich people. One day, John tells Guddu to take Dimple, John's girlfriend, to a nightclub as he is busy on a meeting. Dimple gets physical with Guddu, where John catches them red-handed and buries them alive. Guddu miraculously survives and Kaizad asks him to move away to the city of poor people and meet Shiva, a combat trainer.\nGuddu learns that he is actually Ganapath, a legendary saviour of the poor people, as predicted by Maharishi Dalapathi. Guddu receives combat training under Shiva and his confident Jassi, where he ultimately embraces himself as Ganapath and deceives John, Dalini and their henchmen into believing that he is on their side. Trained as an accomplished fighter, Guddu wins matches for them, while pretending to Jassi and Shiva that he is uninterested in their cause.\nAfter securing victories in most of his matches, Guddu persuades John and Dalini's associate to bet their money on his opponent in the final match as Guddu plans to lose intentionally in the match. Guddu also convinces them to allow the poor to wager their savings on this match, where John and his associates to profit further by snatching money from the poor people, leaving them in a miserable state. However, this is Guddu's way of exacting revenge as he intends to follow a different course.\nWhile releasing Jassi from her confinement, Guddu discreetly instructs her to encourage the poor people to place their savings on the match. Guddu executes the plan, which he shared with John, easily dominating his opponent in the first two rounds. In the third round, Guddu feigns defeat, but realises that John has placed his and Dalini's money on the opponent. Guddu stages a comeback and defeats his opponent, causing substantial losses to John and Dalini. Guddu subsequently reveals his actions on television, watched by both the poor and rich people, and confesses that Shiva is his biological father.\nGuddu tells that he has given a chance for the poor people to challenge the rich people with their winnings, while donning the mantle of Ganapath. Guddu also challenges Dalini to reveal himself, where Dalini reveals himself as Guddu's doppelg\u00e4nger and it is revealed that Dalini is actually a form of AI. Guddu challenges Dalini to a fight, thus hinting a sequel titled Ganapath 2: Rise of the Hero.\n\nCast[edit]\nTiger Shroff in a dual role as Ganapath alias Guddu and Dalini[5]\nKriti Sanon as Jassi[6]\nAmitabh Bachchan as Maharishi Dalapathi, Ganapath\u2019s grandfather (cameo appearance)[7][8]\nElli AvrRam as Dimple[9]\nRahman as Shiva, Ganapath\u2019s father[10]\nGauahar Khan as Meera, Ganapath's mother\nJameel Khan as Kaizad\nGirish Kulkarni as Senior\nShruthy Menon as Shaina\nZiad Bakri as John English, Dimple's boyfriend\nJess Liaudin as Tabahi\nBrahim Chab as Bloodbath\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe film was announced on 6 November 2020 by Pooja Entertainment, to be directed by Aditya Kumar starring Tiger Shroff.[11] It was originally supposed to release in parts, and had a working title of Ganapath: Part 1,[12] though this plan was abandoned and the film was re-titled Ganapath: A Hero is Born.[13] Though a sequel is still teased at the ending of the film titled Ganapath: Part 2: Rise of the Hero.[14] The film marks the collaboration of Sanon and Shroff after nine years since their Hindi film debut in Heropanti (2014).[15] It was produced by Pooja Entertainment in association of GoodCo.\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe principal photography began on 2 November 2021 in United Kingdom.[16][17] In May 2022, the final schedule was held in Ladakh with some additional scenes being shot in February 2023.[18] The film's shooting was wrapped up by August 2023.[19]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nGanapathSoundtrack album by Vishal Mishra, Amit Trivedi, White Noise Studios and Dr. ZeusReleased13 October 2023 [20]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength19:00LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioGanapath \u2013 Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Vishal Mishra, Amit Trivedi, White Noise Studios and Dr. Zeus.

If you expect it to get better in the second half as Gen Z are often heard saying \u2018you are in delulu\u2019.\"[29] Hiren Kotwani of Mid-Day gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"What makes Ganapath different from the saviour-hero films of yore is that director Bahl has tried to make it look like the desi Mad Max of sorts, albeit with unimpressive design and poor packaging\".[30]\nSwetha Ramakrishnan of OTTplay gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"Ganapath is a dated Hindi film with an identity crisis. It is a scary mish-mash of tropes \u201cborrowed\u201d from films like Hunger Games, Mad Max, Dune and KGF.[31] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 1/5 stars and wrote \"What comes as a surprise is just how terrible this film is, with practically no redeeming feature in its nearly two and half hours run-time.\"[32]\nAnuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote \"Tiger Shroff kicks and moves the way only he can, but the Vikas Bahl film doesn\u2019t have the chutzpah to use his talent.\"[33] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times wrote \"Watch Ganapath if you can limit your idea of watching a film to some brilliant dance and action moves, and don't expect anything beyond this.\"[34]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Ganapath (15)\".
