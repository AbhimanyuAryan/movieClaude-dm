Watch it because it takes you where Hindi films rarely do - a zone where ideas, feelings and barely stated dilemmas take precedence over the exigencies of plot and exposition.\"[11] Mayank Shekhar of Mid-Day gave 3 stars out of 5 and reviewed the film, describing it as \"a sweet, sincere, personal film\".[12]\nSana Farzeen of India Today gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and wrote, \"All India Rank, passes most of the criteria needed in a good film and yet, it falls short on entertainment value\".[13] Shilajit Mitra of The Hindu reviewed film and wrote, \"This coming-of-age drama about the IIT-ian dream is humorous and observant, yet hardly stands out in a sea of similar-minded content.\"[14] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in in her review, wrote, \"The film's low-energy hero and fatalistic mood \u2013 the promise of the 1990s notwithstanding \u2013 are difficult to sustain over the 101-minute runtime. Grover's screenplay has a collection of finely written episodes that compensate for Vivek's feeble, familiar coming-of-age experience.\"[15]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe film collected \u20b915 lakh (US$19,000) \u2013 \u20b920 lakh (US$25,000) on its opening day.[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"All India Rank\".
