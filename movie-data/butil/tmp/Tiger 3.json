Starring Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Emraan Hashmi, it is directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films. A sequel to Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), the film is set after the events of War (2019) and Pathaan (2023). In it, Tiger and Zoya set out to stop a rogue ISI agent who uses them to stage a coup against the Pakistani government.\nPrincipal photography began in March 2021 with filming taking place in Delhi, Mumbai, Istanbul, Saint Petersburg and Vienna. The film's soundtrack is composed by Pritam while the background score is composed by Tanuj Tiku. Made at an estimated budget of \u20b9300 crore, it is one of the most expensive Indian films and the most expensive film produced by Yash Raj Films.[3][6]\nTiger 3 was released on 12 November 2023 in standard, IMAX, 4DX, and other premium formats, coinciding with Diwali. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences, music, score, technical aspects and cast performances (particularly Khan, Kaif and Hashmi), but criticism for its plot and pace.[1] The film grossed \u20b9440\u2013466.63 crore worldwide, emerging as the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2023 and the ninth highest-grossing Indian film of 2023.[7]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1999, a teenage Zoya witnesses her father, ISI agent Rehan Nazar, die in a bomb blast. After his funeral, she is visited by Nazar's protege, Aatish Rehman, who convinces her to join the ISI.\nIn the present, Avinash \"Tiger\" Singh Rathore is called for a mission by the new RAW chief Maithili Menon to rescue Tiger's former handler Gopi Arya, who was captured in Afghanistan while trying to extract information from the Taliban about a mission being planned in Pakistan. Following his rescue, Gopi reveals to Tiger that Zoya is involved in the planned mission and succumbs to his injuries. Tiger begins to spy on Zoya, and is later assigned to safeguard an arms supplier named Jibran Sheikh in St. Petersburg, Russia, who worked with Gopi and escaped to the country after being discovered in Pakistan. Tiger witnesses Zoya's attempt to assassinate Sheikh; after saving him, Tiger is captured by Aatish, who reveals that he forced Zoya to assassinate Sheikh by near-fatally drugging and kidnapping her and Tiger's son Junior. In a flashback twelve years prior, It is revealed that Aatish sought to derail a peace treaty between India and Pakistan in Vienna by assassinating the Indian Army General. After refusing to cooperate with the plan, Zoya covertly informs Tiger. Aatish's pregnant wife, Shaheen Baig, attempts the assassination herself, but was shot and killed by Tiger. Aatish denied that his agents knew of the plan and was subsequently imprisoned and ousted from the ISI.\nTiger and Zoya recruit their team of RAW agents Rakesh, Karan and Nikhil, to steal a briefcase for Aatish, containing missile launch codes in Istanbul in exchange for Junior. Aatish then has Tiger and Zoya framed as traitors by their respective countries, leading to Tiger's imprisonment at a military prison in Northern Pakistan. \nTiger is sentenced to death, but manages to escape with the help of Pathaan. He then travels to Islamabad where he meets his adopted son, Hassan, whom Tiger had rescued in a mission in Ikrit.[a] Tiger's team, Zoya and ISI agents Abrar and Javed return to Islamabad, where they learn that Aatish and the Chief of the Army Staff of Pakistan General Imtiaz Haq are planning to assassinate the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nasreen Irani in order for Aatish to replace her. To save the life of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nasreen Irani Tiger, Zoya, and their team secretly enter the Pakistan's PMO and reveal the plan to Irani. Tiger and Zoya take Irani to an underground bunker of Pakistan's PMO and Tiger forces General Haq to publicly reveal the plan. \nHowever, Aatish secretly kills General Haq with the help of Javed, who is revealed to be Shaheen's brother and frames Tiger for killing General Haq. Abrar and Karan are killed by Aatish and Javed, who locate Prime Minister Irani. Hassan sacrifices himself, allowing Tiger and Zoya to help Prime Ministe Irani to escape. Zoya avenges Abrar and Karan's deaths by killing Javed. A fight ensues between Tiger and Aatish, ending with Tiger killing Aatish. Irani exposes Aatish's plot to the public and Tiger, Zoya and their team are proven innocent. Tiger contacts Menon and assures her that he will always be there to serve his country.\nIn a post-credits scene, Colonel Sunil Luthra contacts Kabir Dhaliwal and assigns him to assassinate an unidentified person.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nSalman Khan as Avinash \"Tiger\" Singh Rathore, a RAW agent and Zoya's husband\nKatrina Kaif as Zoya, an ISI agent and Tiger's wife\nEmraan Hashmi as Aatish Rehman, ex-Deputy Director-General of ISI\nRevathi as Maithili Menon, Chief of RAW\nSimran as Nasreen Irani, Prime Minister of Pakistan\nRiddhi Dogra as Shaheen Baig, Aatish's wife and Javed's sister\nVishal Jethwa as Hassan Ali, Tiger and Zoya's adoptive son\nKumud Mishra as Rakesh Prasad Chaurasia\nRanvir Shorey as Gopi Arya, Tiger's former handler\nAamir Bashir as Rehan Nazar, Zoya's father\nGavie Chahal as Major Abrar Sheikh\nAnant Vidhaat Sharma as Karan Rao\nDanish Bhat as Captain Javed Baig, Shaheen's brother\nSartaaj Kakkar as Junior, Tiger and Zoya's son\nChandrachoor Rai as Nikhil\nShahid Latief as  General Imtiaz Haq, Chief of the Army Staff (Pakistan)\nEdward Sonnenblick as Dr. Hoffman\nNeeraj Purohit as Jibran Sheikh\nDanish Husain as General Riaz, Director-General of ISI\nMichelle Lee as General Zimou[8]\nAnish Kuruvilla as Indian Prime Minister\nDenzil Smith as Indian Defence Minister\nBimal Oberoi as General Ribiero, Chief of the Army Staff (India)\nGurket Kaur as young Zoya\nSandeep Kulkarni as Ramiz, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of Pakistan\nVarinder Singh Ghuman as Shakeel, Pakistani Prison Guard[9]\nShah Rukh Khan as Pathaan (cameo appearance)[10]\nHrithik Roshan as Major Kabir Dhaliwal (cameo appearance)[11]\nAshutosh Rana as Colonel Sunil Luthra (cameo appearance)[12]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn early 2020, it was reported that a sequel to Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) was in development, with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif reprising their roles.[13] In late 2020, Maneesh Sharma was roped in to direct the film, taking over from Ali Abbas Zafar who directed the previous installment.

While pacing is an issue at some places, the core plot has enough of an emotional connect to keep you glued on the big screen. The film is an action-packed entertainer that has all the ingredients to emerge as Khan\u2019s highest grosser till date.\"[60] Sonil Dedhia of News18 gave the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Tiger 3 has some excellent action sequences featuring Khan and Kaif. Hashmi does justice to his role as an antagonist. There are many sweet-worthy moments in Tiger 3 including the cameos (which is known by everyone). Khan fans are in for a treat this Diwali.\"[61] Vinamra Mathur of Firstpost gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Khan and Kaif submit themselves to the action of Tiger 3 with full gusto. The film looks stylish, slick, but little overlong. Only if it had more thrills and tension and less talking.\"[62]\nRonak Kotecha of The Times of India gave the film 3/5 stars and wrote \"Tiger 3 qualifies as a good addition to the franchise with enough ammo for mass entertainment.\"[63] Zinia Bandyopadhyay of India Today gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"Despite an overcrowded spy universe, Tiger 3 manages to hold his own ground. Khan fans won\u2019t be disappointed, but someone give Kaif a Zoya series pronto!\"[64] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"All the technical razzmatazz would have come to naught without the presence of a star or two who can add lustre, if only of a superficial kind, to the exercise.\"[65] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Khan is looking his age, but the good thing is that he isn\u2019t hiding it. And of course, the best part of the film is when Pathaan a.k.a. Shah Rukh Khan comes flying into the horizon with his hair still in that sexy man-bun and shooting smart one-liners.\"[66]  Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Too bad the one time it is friendly to the environment, Tiger chooses to celebrate his Diwali with 'meetha' and not 'pathaaka'.\"[67]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times termed its pace as \"inconsistent\" and wrote \"Tiger 3 is massy, masala and a must-watch not because it's a masterpiece, but because it's not everyday you see two superstars sharing screen space even if that's for a little while. Sharma as director packs all the elements in a manner that it makes for an intriguing watch. While the story and broad plot is quite intricate and complex with a new twist and turn waiting to unfold every few minutes, what remains problematic is the inconsistent pace.\"[68] Pratikshya Mishra of The Quint wrote \"Tiger 3 is one of those films that didn\u2019t need to have relied on pure action \u2013 the love story between Tiger and Zoya is the Tiger franchise\u2019s main attraction. Instead, Tiger 3 focuses on a heady mix of a saviour complex and exposition. Despite new additions to the roster and older, familiar faces returning to the mix, Tiger 3 just doesn\u2019t have the thrill and chutzpah required to make the story work.[69]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n29 January 2024\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nEmraan Hashmi\n\nNominated\n\n[70]\n\n\nBest Action\n\nFranz Spilhaus, Oh Sea Young and Sunil Rodrigues\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ As previously shown in Tiger Zinda Hai (2017).\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"MEGA EXCLUSIVE: Salman Khan starrer Tiger 3 to release on Sunday November 12; eyes the big Diwali window\".
