But, like all good plans, it only works for a while until the fire that he has ignited threatens to burn his own house down.\u2014\u200aNetflix\nClass of 83, which is based on a book authored by leading crime journalist Hussain Zaidi, is set in Bombay in the 1980s when the underworld\u2019s stranglehold on the city was becoming hard to break. Dozens of young men rendered jobless as a result of the ongoing mill strike were being lured into joining local gangs, and the nexus between powerful politicians and criminal gang leaders made it hard for the police to weed out the problem. With this as the backdrop, the film follows an ideological cop-turned-trainer who moulds five cadets into encounter specialists.\nYanked off the field for doing his job with more integrity than those in power would like him to, upright officer Vijay Singh (Bobby Deol) lands a \u2018punishment posting\u2019 as the dean of the Police Training Centre in Nashik. Convinced that the only way to restore order in a flawed system is to fix it from the inside, he handpicks a clutch of bold young officers and trains them to bend the law in service of the greater good.\nInspired from real accounts of the city\u2019s first encounter specialists, the film depicts how the officers shrewdly planned and executed hits while staying within the system and following all necessary protocols. But then it quickly slips into a predictable rise-and-fall-and-rise narrative with egos and corruption breaking up the friends, and a last-ditch shot at redemption triggered by their mentor.\n\nCast[edit]\nBobby Deol as Additional Director General of Police Officer Vijay Singh, the husband of Sudha Singh\nBhupendra Jadawat as Pramod Shukla\nGeetika Tyagi as Sudha Singh, the wife of Vijay Singh.\nAnup Soni as CM Manohar Patkar\nJoy Sengupta as DGP Raghav Desai\nVishwajeet Pradhan as Mangesh Dixit\nHans Dev Sharma as YP Mathur\nHitesh Bhojraj as Vishnu Varde\nSameer Paranjape as Aslam Khan\nNinad Mahajani as Laxman Jadhav\nPrithvik Pratap as Janardan Surve\nSpruha Joshi as Pramod Shukla's wife\nProduction[edit]\nThe filming began in the first week of May 2019.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\nClass of '83 was streamed on OTT Platform Netflix from 21 August 2020.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 17% of 12 critics' reviews are positive.[8] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 3 out of 5, writing , \"Class of \u201883 works both as a well-realised if a trifle sketchy hark-back at an interesting epoch, as well as an entertainer. Though we\u2019ve seen so many iterations of the gangsters vs honest law enforcers in the movies, there\u2019s always room for another. Especially because we need stories of cops who believe in their motto of \u2018protect the good and destroy the evil\u2019, today more than ever.\"[9]\nConversely, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 2.5 out of 5, writing, \"Despite Bobby Deol's unfussy impersonation of a stolid, righteous policeman, the film is more tattle than tension, more acrimony than action.\"[10]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee / work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2021\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nBest Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nBobby Deol\n\nNominated\n\n[11]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nBhupendra Jadawat\n\nNominated\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Bobby Deol starrer Class Of '83 to premiere on August 21 on Netflix\".
