They decide to get together, and show the world what they can do with their talent. In their effort, they are joined by two young and handsome men, and the foursome begin producing something in London that can have the world gawking at them in admiration. They do succeed in the end.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nSonakshi Sinha as Saira Khanna\nHuma Qureshi as Rajshri Trivedi\nZaheer Iqbal as Zorawar Rehmani\nMahat Raghavendra as Shrikant Shreevardhan\nShobha Khote as Rajshri's grandmother\nAlka Kaushal as Rajshri's mother\nKanwaljeet Singh as Rajshri's father\nNiki Aneja Walia as Zorawar's mother\nDanish Pandor as Viren\nSachin Shroff as Saurabh Khanna, Saira's brother\nJagat Rawat as Mausaji\nSwati Tarar as Roli Mausi\nDolly Singh as Meera\nDigvijay Singh as Ratan\nIsha Dhillon as Nidhi\nSeana Momsen as Roxanne\nKay Eluvian as Cecile[10]\nShikhar Dhawan (guest appearance) as himself\nJimmy Sheirgill at Atul Chhabra (Cameo)\nKapil Dev (guest appearance) as himself\nSoundtrack[edit]\nDouble XLSoundtrack album by Sohail Sen and Kanishk SethReleased1 November 2022[11]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength15:42LabelT-SeriesOfficial audioDouble XL - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music is composed by Sohail Sen and Kanishk Seth while lyrics are written by Mudassar Aziz and Baba Bulle Shah.[11]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Taali Taali\"Mudassar AzizSohail SenSohail Sen, Silambarasan, Rukhsar Bandhukia3:542.\"Ki Jaana\"Mudassar Aziz, Baba Bulle ShahKanishk SethKavita Seth, Kanishk Seth4:413.\"Tumse Mila Doon\"Mudassar AzizSohail SenSohail Sen, Javed Ali4:044.\"Rangeelo Manva\"Mudassar AzizSohail SenSohail Sen, Rekha Bhardwaj, Pratibha Singh Baghel, Shahid Mallya3:04Total length:15:42\nReception[edit]\nThe movie mostly received negative reviews. Shubhra Gupta for The Indian Express rate the movie 1.5/5 and wrote \"Double XL is a massive opportunity wasted. Crashing pity.\"[12] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV also rated the movie 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"Double XL, with its one-size-fits-all approach, translates into more than just double trouble.\"[13] Anuj Kumar for The Hindu wrote \"More of an essay on body-shaming than a piece of cinema, Double XL is yet another example of good intentions leading to a drab film. \"The makers seem so focused on raising the issue and reflecting diversity on screen, that they seem to have forgotten that the noble idea needs to be packaged into a compelling story as well.\"[14] Suchin Mehrotra for Hindustan Times wrote \"Rounding off the group is London-based line producer Zorawar Khan (an unwatchable Zaheer Iqbal). A painfully animated Zaheer seems to be in his own movie entirely as Zorawar, or as he introduces himself - Zo Za Zoo. I wish I was joking.\"[15] Tushar Joshi for India Today rated 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The sentiment of the filmmaker is to encourage women to embrace their bodies irrespective of the size, frame, and to self-love to free themselves from the shackles of social stigma. Unfortunately, this task feels half-baked and a bit of a misfire in the attempt to give the film a tone of commercial acceptance.\"[16] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote \"One of the high points in Double XL is when Rajshri\u2019s mother (Alka Kaushal) shrieks at her: what was your dream, when did you have it and pray why?\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Double XL\".
