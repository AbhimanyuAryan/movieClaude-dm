Can You Hear It? is a 2021 Indian Hindi-language thriller film written and directed by Aban Bharucha Deohans.[1]  The film produced by Zee Studios, stars Manoj Bajpayee, Prachi Desai and Arjun Mathur.[2] The story of the film revolves around the mysterious disappearance of a woman.[3][4] It was digitally released on ZEE5 on 26 March 2021.[5][6] The film marks Desai's comeback after 4 years. \nIn July 2023 it was revealed that the film would have a sequel[7], Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout (announced for April 2024).[8]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nA team of special cops are investigating the mysterious murder of a high profile victim, who is the daughter of a retired justice. The team is led by ACP Avinash Verma who now works in narcotics division but has been brought on with a special team of serious crime officers to solve this case. The Superior Officers don't favour Avinash Verma but the retired justice Choudhary requests them to hire him for the case as he wants the case to be solved quickly and raptly. Pooja Choudhary, the daughter of Justice Choudhary was found on a tourist site on a hill top by four college students. There was a big wound on her head. The forensic department had found some bits of copper on the wound. This indicates that whatever equipment was used for killing her was a copper one. Also as there were no indications of sexual harassment, justifies that it was not  rape case. If it was not a rape case then it means that due to some personal reason the killer had killed Pooja and that the killer is just around them. There were no blood scattered from Pooja's head on the surrounding spot she was found in which indicates that she was killed in a different place and her body was dumped in the spot she was found in.  Pooja last visited her best friend, Kavita's house in the hope to meet her and show something. But due to an exhibition in Pune, Kavita had gone to Pune and Pooja had spent the night in Kavita's house as it was very late. Kavita's husband Ravi is an MLA. He and Dadu the servant were there and they provided her a room.[9]\nACP Verma and his team begin solving the murder mystery and they have a target to close the case and identify the killer in a week. ACP Verma begins investigation by questioning Pooja's family members and then MLA Ravi Khanna and his helper Dadu. After series of investigation and intriguing encounters ACP Verma solves the case and the plot is revealed. Pooja and Rishabh have an affair, which Rishab's fianc\u00e9e Kia discovers. Enraged she visits Pooja after learning she's at Kavita Khanna's place and demands that Pooja leave Rishabh alone, as he's her fianc\u00e9 but Pooja asks her to speak to Rishabh and not her. This angers Kia and she hits her hard on the head and not knowing what just happened she flees the spot. Kia is finally arrested and Rishab and MLA Ravi Khanna are also arrested for tampering with the evidence.\n\nCast[edit]\nManoj Bajpayee as ACP Avinash Verma IPS[10]\nPrachi Desai as Inspector Sanjana Bhatia\nArjun Mathur as MLA Ravi Khanna[2]\nBarkha Singh as Pooja Choudhary[11]\nHitha Chandrashekhar as Kavita Khanna\nSahil Vaid as Inspector Amit Chauhan[11]\nUjjwal Gauraha as Saneshwar (Sunny)\nShishir Sharma as Justice Chaudhary, Pooja's father\nDenzil Smith as Commissioner Sanjay Sharma IPS\nVaquar Shaikh as Inspector Raj Gupta[11]\nSohaila Kapoor as Mrs. Chaudhary, Pooja's mother[11]\nAmit Thakkar as Rishabh[11]\nBhushan Shimpi as Javed[citation needed]\nGarima Yagnik as Kia[11]\nRelease[edit]\nInitially the digital release date was on 5 March 2021 on ZEE5 platform.[3] Later, it was released on 26 March 2021.[5][6]\n\nReception[edit]\nResponse to the film was mixed.
