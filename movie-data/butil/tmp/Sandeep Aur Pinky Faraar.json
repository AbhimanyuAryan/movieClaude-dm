Several hours earlier, Sandeep Kaur Walia a.k.a. Sandy, a top executive at Parivartan Bank, is waiting for her boss, Parichay, for a dinner date at an upscale restaurant. She meets a journalist, Purva, who invites her to a party later in the evening. Outside, Sandy meets Satinder Dahiya alias \"Pinky\", who informs her that he is a cop with Haryana police and Parichay has sent a car to take her to a different location. Sandy is annoyed by Pinky's driving, especially since he is continuously on the phone with his boss (informing him of their location) and reveals that she is three months pregnant. Pinky encounters hooting from an SUV of young men and when his boss asks for his car's license plate number, he gives the number of the SUV.\nThe SUV is stopped at a police checkpost and they start firing indiscriminately at it, as shown in the first scene. Pinky, who is behind the SUV, witnesses the massacre and drives to an isolated place. He concludes that Sandy was the actual target and the police wanted to kill him as well to make Sandy a casualty in a failed operation on a suspended police officer. Pinky calls up his boss Tyagi, the head of a private security firm, who tries to calm him down and demands answers from Sandy but she remains evasive.\nSandy takes Pinky to the party Purva invited her to in order to relax and get a sense of the situation, where she finds that her SM accounts are blocked. The police track her and the duo flees the party. Pinky briefly considers killing Sandy to protect himself but cannot go through with it. He plans to go to Nepal and Sandy asks Pinky to take her with him, promising a million rupees in exchange. They travel by train and then bus to Pithoragarh, a border town to Nepal. Upset by the unsanitary conditions around her, Sandy requests a friendly couple, Aunty and Uncle, in the market to take them as paying guests. Pinky finds an agent who will create fake documents for them to cross over.\nUncle reveals that he has invested four lakhs in the 'Swabhiman' scheme of Parivartan Bank. Sandy is alarmed and helps him to withdraw his money from the scheme. Sandy reveals to Pinky that the Swabhiman scheme was her brainchild: a fraudulent scheme designed to get a vast number of depositors in a small-time to save her sinking bank. During this time, she had an affair with her boss and became pregnant. Sandy wanted to resign after taking her share of 32 crores for the sake of her child, which Parichay refused and is the reason he wants to kill her. She gets Uncle a refund from the scheme at the bank by offering the manager a chance to embezzle a few million rupees using her intimate knowledge of its operations.\nLater that night, when the funds are transferred, Parichay's team in Delhi is alerted to Sandy's location. The bank manager recognizes Sandy and tries to rape her but she fights him off and consequently suffers a miscarriage. Pinky tends to Sandy's wounds and cremates her foetus. Sandy cannot bear this loss and goes into shock. Pinky tries to help her recover and they grow closer.\nTyagi traces the two to a wedding procession which they were supposed to use as a disguise to cross the border. Pinky learns of this and calls Tyagi, asking him to let Sandy pass in return for the 1 million he had earlier received from her and he surrender but his boss refuses. Sandy decides to settle some scores and convinces Pinky to leave without her. She returns to the city while Pinky cross-dresses and escapes the police check post.\nSandy understands that if Tyagi's team gets hold of her, she would be killed. She instead surrenders herself to the local police and exposes the scam of Parivartan Bank. Purva visits Sandy in jail and tells her about Parichay's arrest, with six cases of fraud filed against him. Purva points out that Sandy could have received a lighter sentence and more sympathy if she disclosed her miscarriage but Sandy refuses. Purva then gives Sandy a package from P. Thapa, which has been posted from Nepal, addressed to her. It contains only a few photos of kids dancing in a Bollywood dance school in Nepal. Sandy understands it's from Pinky and smiles.\n\nCast[edit]\nParineeti Chopra as Sandeep \"Sandy\" Kaur Walia\nArjun Kapoor as Satinder \"Pinky\" Dahiya\nJaideep Ahlawat as Tyagi\nRaghubir Yadav as Uncle\nNeena Gupta as Aunty\nDinker Sharma as Parichay\nDaljeet Singh as Bose\nJaipreet Singh as Garry Ji\nRahul Kumar as Munna\nDev Chauhan  as Nihal\nAbhishek Yadav  as Harshad\nSuruchi Aulakh as Purva\nProduction[edit]\nYash Raj Films announced the film on 3 July 2017.[8][9] It marks the third collaboration between Kapoor and Chopra after they starred together in Ishaqzaade (2012), which was followed by the two pairing up again in Namaste England (2018).[10]\nOn 30 October 2017, Arjun Kapoor shared an image of his character which is shown to be a cop.[11][12] On 27 March 2018, the second look of both actors came out giving a glimpse of their different worlds.[13]\nFilming took place at the nearby places (Pithoragarh) of Indo-Nepal border of Uttarakhand.[10] To get into their characters, Banerjee insisted the two not to communicate with each other prior to filming and even off-screen.[14] Filming of Arjun's portion wrapped up on 17 January 2018.[15]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nSandeep Aur Pinky FaraarSoundtrack album by Anu Malik, Dibakar Banerjee, Narendra Chandra and Kamlesh HaripuriReleased9 March 2021[16]Recorded2019\u201320GenreFeature Film SoundtrackLength14:33LanguageHindiLabelYRF MusicProducerDibakar BanerjeeOfficial audioSandeep Aur Pinky Faraar \u2013 Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's soundtrack is composed by Anu Malik, Dibakar Banerjee, Narendra Chandra and Kamlesh Haripuri, with lyrics written by Anu Malik, Dibakar Banerjee, Pardhaan, Narendra Chandra, Sangeeta Chandra and Kamlesh Haripuri.

While mainstream Bollywood fares spell out every little detail and even hammer it repeatedly, Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar fervently sticks to its austerity\u2019\u2019.[22] Anupama Chopra of Film Companion wrote, \u2018\u2018Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar doesn't have the pacing that you might expect in a chase film. The narrative has long stretches that plod dangerously. But ultimately, Dibakar steers it to a climax that is both stinging and satisfying\u2019\u2019.[23]\nAnna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film 2.75 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \u2018\u2018The film is a mixed bag but I found myself drawn to its quietude and to its heartening conviction that kindness may be found in the most unexpected places and the most unexpected persons could turn out to be allies, sometimes without the expectation of anything in return\u2019\u2019.[24] Ronak Kotecha of Times of India gave 2.5 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \u2018\u2018Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar is one of those neo-noir films that set out with a promise to engage, entertain and educate by slowly unraveling its layered subtext. But with its preposterous execution and frustratingly slow pace, it\u2019s the audience who might want to escape, much before Sandeep and Pinky\u2019\u2019.[25] Film critic based at Bollywood Hungama gave the film 2 stars (out of 5) and wrote, \u2018\u2018Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar has a bearable first half but goes terribly downhill in the second hour\u2019\u2019. However, they praised Chopra and Kapoor by stating that they delivered a \u2018\u2018convincing\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018restrained\u2019\u2019 respectively.[26] Tanul Thakur of The Wire (India) called the film \u201ca joyless, drab watch\u201d and stated that its Banerjee\u2019s most \u2018\u2018underwhelming\u2019\u2019 movie. He wrote, \u2018\u2018The most obvious culprits are the lead actors who struggle to bring any kind of magnetism or chemistry to their roles\u2019\u2019.[27]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe film was released in 375 screens on 19 March 2021.[2] The film earned \u20b96 lakhs on its opening day and the opening weekend collection was \u20b920 lakhs.[2]\nIn its complete theatrical run the film grossed \u20b940 lakh in India and \u20b918.125 lakh overseas, for a worldwide gross collection of \u20b958.125 lakhs.[2]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominee(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2022\n\n67th Filmfare Awards\n\nBest Film (Critics)\n\nDibakar Banerjee\n\nNominated\n\n[28]\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nParineeti Chopra\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nNeena Gupta\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Story\n\nDibakar Banerjee,Varun Grover\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Dialogue\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nAnil Mehta\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nRohit Chaturvedi\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Editing\n\nBakul Baljeet Matiyani\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nAparna Sud, Garima Mathur\n\nNominated\n\n\n28th Lions Gold Awards\n\nPowerhouse Performer of The Year\n\nParineeti Chopra\n\nWon\n\n[29]\n\n\nFOI Online Awards\n\nBest Feature Film\n\nSandeep Aur Pinky Faraar\n\nNominated\n\n[30]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nDibakar Banerjee\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nDibakar Banerjee & Varun Grover\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Dialogues\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\nParineeti Chopra\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nRaghuvir Yadav\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n\nNeena Gupta\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Performance by an Ensemble Cast\n\nCast of Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nAnil Mehta\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Film Editing\n\nBakul Baljeet Matiyani\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Music Direction \u2013 Score\n\nDibakar Banerjee\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nRohit Chaturvedi\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Choreography\n\n\u201cFaraar\u201d \u2013 Vaibhavi Merchant\n\nNominated\n\nHome media[edit]\nOn 20 May 2021, the movie began streaming on Amazon Prime Video and was positively received.[31][32][33]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"BREAKING:Yash Raj Films unveils release dates of its forthcoming films!\".
