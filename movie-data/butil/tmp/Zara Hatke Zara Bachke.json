The film is written and directed by Laxman Utekar and produced by Maddock Films and Jio Studios.[5]\nThe film was released in theatres on 2 June 2023 to mixed reviews from critics. Made on a \u20b940 crore budget, Zara Hatke Zara Bachke emerged as a sleeper hit, grossing \u20b9115.89 crore worldwide.[4] At the 69th Filmfare Awards, the film received four nominations, including Best Music Director and Best Lyricist. \n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe story revolves around Kapil and Somya - a middle-class happily married couple from Indore who want to get a house of their own through the Indian government's flagship program: the Awas Yojna scheme. The story starts with Kapil, a yoga instructor, and Somya, a teacher living under a joint family with Kapil\u2019s parents and his aunt and uncle staying with them due to which they have to give up their room and sleep in the hall. Somya a Sikh girl from background is often looked down by Kapil's aunt as they are pure Brahmins. Kapil always tries to intervene and make up to Somya by taking her out for lunch for her favorite food. \nSomya always wanted a house of her own and after looking for a house which they both liked, the broker tries to get more money which was discussed when showcasing the house by giving all house rates as expensive. So then they learn about this Awas Yojna and Kapil goes to inquire about it but returns empty-handed as he has had an argument with the employee. However, the peon in the office who also has a side business of settlements and brokerage due to being a government employee gives advice to Kapil and Somya about the scheme and tell them that to be eligible, Kapil either has to be kicked out of their parents' inheritance or Somya should divorce him in order to qualify as a single divorced lady. They initially brush off the idea, but Somya wants her own home so badly that she convinces Kapil to go with the divorce process. \nHe reluctantly agrees and then a series of comedic events start as they are faking their divorce in front of all including their families. Finally their divorce is approved, but then the broker is caught and the Yojna (scheme) draw results are halted due to which there is a argument between Kapil and Somya, as the former says it was due to Somya\u2019s greed he is divorced and they are in this situation just to get some privacy and space of their own. After some time Somya gets the papers of her new home from the Indian Government and she confesses all this to her parents and they all go to Kapil's house and they come clean. But Kapil\u2019s aunt faints and is taken to hospital where it is revealed that her kidneys are failing and she needs urgent transplant. \nDuring this time Somya realizes the importance of family and now no longer wants her separate house. Soon they give the house keys and papers to the security guard of the society they were living as he has a young daughter and doesn\u2019t have a house.\nAfter sometime Somya and Kapil remarry and start a happy life.\n\nCast[edit]\nVicky Kaushal as Kapil Dubey\nSara Ali Khan as Somya Chawla Dubey\nInaamulhaq as Ban Das Ishwardas Sahay\nSushmita Mukherjee as Roshni Chawla\nNeeraj Sood as Purushottam Mama\nRakesh Bedi as Harcharan Chawla\nSharib Hashmi as Daroga Raghuvanshi\nAkash Khurana as Ved Prakash Dubey\nKanupriya Pandit as Deepa Mami\nAnubha Fatehpura as Mamta Dubey\nHimanshu Kohli as Manoj Bhagel\nSrishti Ganguli Rindani as Mehjabeen\nVivan Shah as Sajjan\nDimpy Mishra as Dimpy Sir\nAtul Tiwari as Judge\nMarketing[edit]\nThe film's title was announced with a teaser one day before the release of trailer.[6] There had been rumors that the film was set to be called Luka Chuppi 2.[7]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nZara Hatke Zara BachkeSoundtrack album by Sachin\u2013JigarReleased2 June 2023Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength15:25LanguageHindiLabelSaregama MusicSachin\u2013Jigar chronology\n\n\nBhediya(2022)\n\nZara Hatke Zara Bachke(2023)\n\nAankh Micholi(2023)\nOfficial audioZara Hatke Zara Bachke - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's music was composed by Sachin\u2013Jigar.
