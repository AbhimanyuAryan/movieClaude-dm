The film released theatrically on 28 February 2020. This film received positive reviews from both critics and audience.\nAt the 66th Filmfare Awards, Thappad received 15 nominations, including Best Director (Sinha), Best Supporting Actor (Mishra) and Best Supporting Actress (Azmi), and won a leading 7 awards, including Best Film and Best Actress (Pannu).\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAmrita Sandhu and Vikram Sabharwal are happily married. Amrita is a homemaker, looking after her husband and the house. During a party to celebrate his promotion, Vikram learns that his promotion has been compromised for his inexperienced junior, who is a relative of his boss. Angered, he gets into an argument with his superior, Rajhans. When Amrita tries to break up the argument, Vikram slaps her publicly. The incident leaves her shaken and opens her eyes to all the little unfair things she had previously ignored. She realizes that a husband who respects her wouldn't slap her. Moreover, Vikram refuses to take accountability or apologize for his actions. \nUnable to \"forget it and move on\", as everyone advises her to do, Amrita leaves for her parents\u2019 home and files for divorce. This shocks her family. She makes no claims for alimony; her stand is simply that Vikram has no right to hit her and that the slap made her realize she was getting neither respect nor happiness. \nThings get complicated when she discovers she is pregnant. Vikram and his lawyer play dirty, making false claims against her to get sole custody of the unborn child. Hurt, Amrita decides to file a domestic violence charge unless he agrees to a divorce and joint custody of the child. Vikram settles for the divorce. Meanwhile, his boss informs him that he is getting the promotion after all. \nAmrita speaks to her mother-in-law Sulakshana in the presence of both their families, explaining that on the night he slapped her, nobody in the family asked once if she was okay; they did not hold Vikram accountable, tell him he was wrong, or advise him to apologise. The only thing she was told was to endure it to keep the peace. Sulakshana apologises, acknowledging their misogyny, and says Amrita is doing the right thing. \nWhen Amrita and Vikram meet in court to finalise their divorce, Vikram apologises to her for the first time. He says he rejected the promotion and quit his job, and will try to be someone who deserves her. The two complete their divorce and part ways with a sense of renewed hope.\n\nCast[edit]\nTaapsee Pannu as Amrita \"Amu\" Sabharwal (n\u00e9e Sandhu)\nPavail Gulati as Vikram Sabharwal, Amrita's husband\nDia Mirza as Shivani Fonseca, Amrita's friend; Vikram's neighbour\nMaya Sarao as Advocate Netra Jaisingh\nGeetika Vidya Ohlyan as Sunita\nKumud Mishra as Sachin Sandhu, Amrita's father\nRatna Pathak Shah as Sandhya Sandhu, Amrita's mother\nTanvi Azmi as Sulakshana Sabharwal, Vikram's mother\nRam Kapoor as Advocate Pramod Gujral, Vikram's Lawyer\nNaila Grewal as Swati Sandhu, Karan's fianc\u00e9\nAnkur Rathee as Karan Sandhu, Amrita's brother\nSushil Dahiya as Romesh Sabharwal, Vikram's father\nNidhi Uttam as Kavita Sabharwal, Vikram's sister-in-law\nSiddhant Karnick as Viraj Sabharwal, Vikram's brother\nManav Kaul as Rohit Jaisingh, Netra's husband\nGracy Goswami as Sania Fonseca\nRohan Khurana as Priyan\nShantanu Ghatak as Subodh\nHarssh A.
