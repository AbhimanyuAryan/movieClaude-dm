The film serves as the first installment of a planned trilogy, which is itself planned to be part of a cinematic universe titled \u0100straverse, and stars an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Mouni Roy and Akkineni Nagarjuna while Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone appear in cameo roles. The film's songs are composed by Pritam, with soundtrack lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Drawing inspiration from tales in Hindu mythology, the story follows Shiva, an orphan musician with pyrokinetic powers who discovers that he is an astra, a weapon of enormous energy. He attempts to prevent the strongest of the astras, the Brahm\u0101stra, from falling into the hands of dark forces that share a history with him.\nThe film was first conceived by Mukerji in 2011, with core elements being inspired by Indian history and stories he heard in his childhood. Its development was first revealed in July 2014 with a planned release for 2016, but its official announcement arrived in October 2017 revealing that the film would be titled Brahm\u0101stra and would be a trilogy. Principal photography lasted from February 2018 to March 2022, with filming locations including Bulgaria, London, New York City, Edinburgh, Thailand, Manali, Mumbai and Varanasi.[11] Production and release of the film was delayed multiple times, first due to production delays and monetary constraints, and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBrahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva was theatrically released on 9 September 2022. It was the first production released under the Star Studios[c] name following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. The film received mixed reviews with praise for the performances, visual effects, soundtrack, musical score and action sequences while criticism was directed towards the dialogue.[12] It became the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 and fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2022.[13] Two sequels are being developed simultaneously and are slated to be released in December 2026 and December 2027 respectively.[14]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn ancient India, a group of sages in the Himalayas collide with the energy Brahm-shakti, which produces many celestial weapons of great power called astras. The strongest among them, the Brahm\u0101stra, has the capacity to destroy the world. The sages use their respective astras to tame the unstable Brahm\u0101stra and become the Brahmansh, a secret society to protect the world from the powers of astras.\nIn present-day Mumbai, Shiva, a disc jockey, falls in love at first sight with Isha Chatterjee, a London resident who is visiting India for the Durga Puja festival at her grandfather's pandal. Soon, Isha reciprocates and expresses her feelings for Shiva. Shiva tells her that he is an orphan who never knew his father, and that his mother died in a fire when he was a baby (1993).\nMeanwhile, in Delhi, scientist and Brahm\u0101nsh member Mohan Bhargav is attacked by Zor and Raftar for a piece of Brahm\u0101stra he safeguards. Mohan fights back using the V\u0101nar\u0101stra but is ultimately subdued by Junoon, who works for the mysterious evil named Dev. Under Junoon's possession, who was using Vash Mukut, Mohan reveals that the second piece of Brahm\u0101stra is protected by an artist and archaeologist named Anish Shetty in Varanasi. Before he can reveal the current location and guru of the Brahm\u0101nsh (Ashram), Mohan throws himself out of a balcony.\nShiva has a vision of Mohan's encounter with Junoon, as she has a piece of Agney\u0101stra tied to her one hand, and Shiva is somehow connected to it. He and Isha head to Varanasi to warn Anish but are interrupted by Raftar, who now wields Mohan's V\u0101nar\u0101stra. Anish defeats him using the Nandi \u0100stra before escaping with Shiva and Isha. While going to Himachal Pradesh, where Ashram is located, they are chased by Junoon and Zor in a truck. Anish gives the second piece of the Brahm\u0101stra to Shiva and stays to fight Junoon and Zor, only to be killed. Shiva and Isha are chased by Raftar to Ashram where Shiva kills him using his power of fire after he tried to kill Isha. At Ashram, they learn about other astras and Shiva is forced to join Brahmansh by the guru Raghu for information on his parents. He meets other new recruits Rani, Raveena, Sher and Tenzing, who are all trained by Raghu on how to use their respective astras and Shiva also gains control over fire. As Junoon gets closer to them, Raghu reveals that Shiva is the son of former Brahmansh members, Dev and Amrita. Dev actually awoke the Brahm\u0101stra as he was the only person who was able to control multiple \u0101stras at once.\nDev's wife Amrita (pregnant with Dev's child), who wielded the Jal\u0101stra, defeated Dev in a battle on a remote island and both of them seemingly perished in the battle. Amrita's boat was found in the ruins of the battle, brought back from the island, with two broken pieces of the Brahm\u0101stra. The pieces of the Brahm\u0101stra were given to both Mohan and Anish. The third piece was believed to be missing, with Raghu and Shiva concluding that they both survived the battle. The third piece of the Brahm\u0101stra is in Amrita's May\u0101stra disguised as a conch shell, which Raghu releases by dropping Shiva's blood on the conch. Junoon and her army arrive at \u0100shram for the Brahm\u0101stra and hold everyone hostage. Shiva defeats Junoon while also killing Zor, who wielded Anish's Nandi \u0100stra and releases everyone. But Junoon manages to take the third piece from Isha. She seemingly sacrifices herself to activate the Brahm\u0101stra. The destruction begins and Isha is in danger, but Shiva gains control over the Brahm\u0101stra with newfound strength stemming from his protectiveness and love of Isha and reunites with her.\nBefore the credits, due to Junoon having activated the Brahm\u0101stra, Dev, who was imprisoned as a statue on an unknown island, is released.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAmitabh Bachchan as Raghu aka 'Guruji', the guru of Brahm\u0101nsh, who is also their leader and wields the Prabh\u0101stra\nRanbir Kapoor as Shiva, Amrita and Dev's son; an orphan and newly recruited member of the Brahm\u0101nsh, who possesses the Agniastra (the astra of fire) within himself\nNivaan Gupta as baby Shiva\nAlia Bhatt as Isha Chatterjee, an NRI from London and Shiva's girlfriend (character based on Hindu Goddess Parvati)\nMouni Roy as Junoon, Dev's right\u2013hand woman who wields the Kavach\u0101stra and aims to revive the Brahm\u0101stra and release Dev\nNagarjuna Akkineni as Anish Shetty, an artist, architect, archaeologist and a member of the Brahm\u0101nsh who wielded the Nandi \u0100stra\nShah Rukh Khan as Mohan Bhargav, a SpaceHind Astronomy Senior scientist and a member of the Brahm\u0101nsh who wielded the Vanar\u0101stra.\nDimple Kapadia as Savitri Devi, a member of Brahm\u0101nsh\nGurfateh Pirzada as Sher, a new recruit of Brahm\u0101nsh who wields the N\u0101g Dhanush[15]\nStanzin Delek as Tensing, a new recruit of Brahm\u0101nsh who wielded the Pawan\u0101stra\nLehar Khan as Raveena, a new recruit of Brahm\u0101nsh who wields the Gaj\u0101stra\nAditi Joshi as Rani, a new recruit of Brahm\u0101nsh who possesses \u0100yu Madrik\u0101\nMarkand Soni as Santha, a new recruit of Brahm\u0101nsh and its tech guy who wields the Chakravath\u0101stra (Dagger of Resurrection)\nSaurav Gurjar as Zor, a henchman of Junoon who stole the Nandi \u0100stra from Anish[16]\nRouhallah Gazi as Raftaar, another henchman of Junoon who stole the Vanar\u0101stra from Mohan\nChaitanya Sharma as Tiger, Shiva's friend\nSaqib Ayub as Ali, Shiva's friend\nRashi Mal as Shaina, Isha's cousin\nRohan Rustomji as Sunny, Isha's cousin\nFarida Devi as Aunty, Shiva's landlady\nRiyaaz Makaney as Isha's grandfather\nDeepika Padukone as Amrita, Shiva's mother, Dev's wife and a former member of the Brahm\u0101nsh who wielded the Jal\u0101stra(Cameo Appearance)[17]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe idea of Brahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva first came to Mukerji in 2011 while writing the script for his second film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013).[18] Mukerji first announced that he was working on a new project in July 2014.[19][20] In October 2017, Brahm\u0101stra was officially announced by producer Karan Johar. Mukerji was signed as the director while Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Amitabh Bachchan were set to star. Initially, the film's working title was Dragon, but was officially titled as Brahm\u0101stra in 2017. Mukerji explained that the title Brahm\u0101stra \"resonates with the ancient wisdom, energies and power.\"[21] Mukerji also revealed that it is a \"contemporary film with ancient elements.\"[22] In 2017, Johar revealed his plan to make the film into a film trilogy.[23][24] The preparation for the film started in January 2018.[25]\nIn an interview, Kapoor stated that Mukerji \"has spent six years of his life working really hard to make an original story\" and that the trilogy would be made over a period of 10 years[26] and refuted rumours suggesting that it is a romantic superhero film. Instead, Kapoor confirmed that the film is a \"romantic fairytale in a supernatural format\" and that the film is not something which \"doesn't have truth to it, or which is unbelievable\".[26] Telugu film actor Nagarjuna Akkineni also confirmed that he would be playing a \"pivotal\" role and it marked his return to Hindi cinema after 19 years, following his appearance in 2003 film LOC: Kargil.[27] Mouni Roy revealed in an interview that she is the \"only antagonist\" in the film.[28][29]\nIn June 2022, Mukerji announced the film would be a part of a trilogy franchise\u00a0\u2013 serving as the first instalment\u00a0\u2013 under the Astraverse, a cinematic universe centered around various mystical astras.[30][31] In August 2022, Roy confirmed Shah Rukh Khan had a cameo appearance in the film.[32] Khan reprises his character from the film Swades (2004).[33][34][35]\n\nPre-production[edit]\nAyan Mukherji started work 9 years before the theatrical release. Pre-production work started in 2014 and filming began in 2018.[36] In February 2018, Bachchan and Kapoor did look tests in the presence of Mukerji.[37]\n\nThemes[edit]\nIn July 2022, a video was released featuring Mukerji explaining the mystical universe of various astras.[38] He explained how from the Brahm-Shakti, astras were born, which compose all the different energies that are found in nature like Jal\u0101stra (water), Pawan\u0101stra (wind), and Agnyastra (fire). He also talked about astras that store the powers of different animals like the Vanar\u0101stra, which can give the power of a \"divine\" monkey to the person who controls it, and the Nandi\u0101stra, which contains the power and strength of a thousand bulls, within itself. The last \u0101stra to emerge from the universe, carrying the collective power of the Brahm-Shakti\u00a0\u2013 called the \"lord of all the \u0101stras\"\u00a0\u2013 is explained to be one of the most powerful celestial weapons of gods (or Devas) in Hindu mythology, the Brahm\u0101stra.[39] Mukerji stated that the core idea was inspired by stories of Hindu mythology he heard in his childhood from his grandfather.[40] Kapoor described the film as an action-adventure about a DJ named Shiva and his journey with his ladylove Isha, and finally something that leads him to his destiny which is the Brahmastra.[41]\n\nCharacters[edit]\nMukerji revealed that the inspiration behind actor Kapoor's character came from Rumi who also inspired the first look of his character. Mukerji also drew inspiration from Rumi's work: \"love is the bridge between you and everything\", to build the foundation of the film. Later, he revealed that the Rumi-inspired look was scrapped and Kapoor had gotten a haircut instead.[42] Kapoor revealed his experience with look tests for the film, expressing that it is a \"tedious job: sticking, removing applying, de-applying, and applying again, until some decision is reached\".[43]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in February 2018 with the commencement of the first schedule of the film on 24 February 2018. The first schedule of the film was wrapped up in Bulgaria on 24 March 2018.[44] The second schedule of filming continued in said country and then London on 8 July 2018,[45] in New York in late July,[46] and then back in Bulgaria by the end of the month.[47][48] Extensive shooting started on 1 February 2019 at Edinburgh, Scotland.[49] The 20-day schedule started in the Ramnagar Fort and Chet Singh Fort in Varanasi on 30 July 2019.[50] The filming was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[51] and later resumed in November 2020.[52][53] Filming wrapped up on 29 March 2022 in Varanasi.[54] After S. S. Rajamouli's father, K.V. Vijayendra Prasad, proposed some changes in the film to Mukerji, reshoots were conducted for four days.[55]\nIt was reported that the production budget for the film was \u20b9410 crore (US$51\u00a0million), which would make it one of the most expensive Indian films and the most expensive Hindi film ever at the time of its release.[56] However, the lead actor Ranbir Kapoor later clarified that the reported budget was for production of all three main installments of the franchise, and the assets built during the production of the first film will be used in future installments.[57]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nIn the post-production, it is estimated that 150 crore rupees were spent on VFX by makers.[58] The VFX work was done by DNEG-Prime focus company. Editing was supervised by Prakash Kurup. Jam8 music and sound design studio, led by Pritam, provided sound effects. DNEG and ReDefine's foreign team created visual effects. Chiranjeevi did the voice-over for the Telugu version.[59] Ranbir and Alia dubbed for their portions in September 2020 in a studio in Bandra.[60]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Brahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva (soundtrack)\nPritam composed the soundtrack while composing the background score along with Prasad Shaste, Jim Satya, Meghdeep Bose, Tanuj Tiku & Ketan Sodha,[61] while the songs are produced and mixed by British musician Steel Banglez,[62] with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya.[63][64] The score was recorded at Synchron Stage Vienna.[65] The song \"Rasiya\" was sung by singer Tushar Joshi.\nThe film's titular soundtrack album was officially released on 6 October to streaming formats and digital retailers, coinciding with the occasion of

If the unnecessary parts about love and lovers could have been avoided the impact would have been stronger. For now, the sound and light show should suffice\".[204] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times stated, \"Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are electric in this Ayan Mukerji spectacle. The film is a treat for long-waiting fans of Hindi cinema.\"[205] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu stated \"Despite the presence of Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Amitabh Bachchan, the film's writing turns out to be its biggest drawback with all the hype over Indian mythology just being a cosmetic cover\".[206]\nReputed film critic Taran Adarsh rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Brahm\u0101stra is a king-sized disappointment High on VFX, low on content [second half nosedives]. Brahm\u0101stra could've been a game changer, but, alas, it is a missed opportunity. All gloss, no soul.\"[207] Rohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated \"a so-called critique-proof film Brahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva might have a larger-than-life scale, grandeur, and visual spectacle but nothing more to this run-of-the-mill good v/s evil story.\"[208] Writing for Deccan Herald, Vivek M.

Vetticad of Firstpost rated the film 2 out of 5 stars, finding its story \"weak\" and the romance between the leads \"unconvincing\".[210] Rayan Sayyed of IGN India also criticized the romance between the film's leads and wrote that \"the mythology and its computer-generated portrayals are the only reasons to watch this film.\"[211] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, panning it: \"Despite all those non-stop computer graphics, the opulence of the sets, the starry array, the film's commitment to its subject, we never really buy into it completely\".[212] Ishita Bhargav of Financial Express found the film to be clich\u00e9 and criticized the dialogue, stating that the \"grand vision ends up becoming a film for kids.\"[213] Pooja Biraia Jaiswal of The Week rated the film 1 out of 5 stars and said Mukerji \"has wasted the skills and popularity of Shah Rukh Khan, Nagarjuna, and of course, Amitabh Bachchan\".[214] A critic of The Wire panned the film by stating \"the story lacks vitality, momentum, and intrigue. The film is devoid of genuine joy. Characters and settings come at you all the time, as if you've entered a lunch buffet on a full stomach.\"[215]\n\nInternational[edit]\nAmerican audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film a 70% overall positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.[216]\nSimon Abrams of the TheWrap commented that the film plays out as exceedingly familiar superhero fantasy but somehow hasn't nailed the genre.[217] Courtney Howard of Variety called the film \"a wildly entertaining jump start to a planned trilogy\" and was appreciative of Mukerji's direction: \"He smashes up genre conventions as Western cinematic influences readily co-mingle with pure Bollywood razzle-dazzle.\"[218] Conversely, Scott Mendelson from Forbes rated the film 4 out of 10 and commented that \"despite strong production values and the expected larger-than-life razzle-dazzle, this first entry in India's first original cinematic universe repeats the same mistake that doomed Universal's Dark Universe and most other post-Avengers attempts at a cinematic universe.\"[219] Mike McCahill of The Guardian rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Mukerji brings a peppy, wide-eyed spirit to the superhero-movie model, adorning tried-and-tested arcs and beats with workable Pritam songs, ravishing colours and gorgeous people\".[220] IndieWire rated the film C+ in a mixed review criticizing the cast and performances, calling them \"bloated\" and concluded by stating it as an admirable attempt and unmissable theatrical experience for any Bollywood fan.[221]\n\nBox office[edit]\nBrahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva has grossed \u20b9320 crore (US$40\u00a0million) in India and \u20b9111 crore (US$14\u00a0million) overseas, for a worldwide gross of est.\u20b9431 crore (US$54\u00a0million).[7][8] In the United States and Canada, the film made US$4.5 million from 810 theatres in its opening weekend.[216] With earnings of \u20b9189 crore in Hindi and \u20b9213 crore overall worldwide in its first weekend, the film emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film overseas since the COVID-19 pandemic.[222][223] It also had the highest domestic weekend for an original Hindi film, and the second-highest for a film with screenings in Hindi after K.G.F: Chapter 2.[224] Box Office India in their year-end report gave Brahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva a \u2018\u2018hit\u2019\u2019 verdict.[13]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s) and nominee(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef(s)\n\n\nZee Cine Awards\n\n26 February 2023\n\nBest Film\n\nBrahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva\n\nNominated\n\n[225]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nAyan Mukerji\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Story\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nRanbir Kapoor\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Music Director\n\nPritam\n\nWon\n\n\nSong of the Year\n\n\"Kesariya\"\n\nWon\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n27 April 2023\n\nBest Film\n\nBrahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva\n\nNominated\n\n[226]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nAyan Mukerji\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nMouni Roy\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Music Director\n\nPritam\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Lyricist\n\nAmitabh Bhattacharya for \"Kesariya\"\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Male Playback Singer\n\nArijit Singh for \"Deva Deva\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nArijit Singh for \"Kesariya\"\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Female Playback Singer\n\nJonita Gandhi for \"Deva Deva\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Art Direction\n\nAmrita Mahal Nakai\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Choreography\n\nGanesh Acharya for \"Dance Ka Bhoot\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Cinematographer\n\nSudeep Chatterjee\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Sound Design\n\nBishwadeep Dipak Chatterjee\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Background Score\n\nPritam, Jim Satya, Prasad S, Meghdeep Bose, Tanuj Tiku, Ketan Sodha, Sunny M.R.\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Action\n\nDan Bradley, Diyan Hristov and Parvez Shaikh\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Special Effects\n\nDneg, ReDefine\n\nWon\n\n\nIIFA Awards\n\n26-27 May 2023\n\nBest Director\n\nAyan Mukerji\n\nNominated\n\n[227]\n\n\nBest Story\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nShah Rukh Khan\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nMouni Roy\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Music Director\n\nPritam\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Lyricist\n\nAmitabh Bhattacharya for \"Kesariya\"\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Male Playback Singer\n\nArijit Singh for \"Kesariya\"\n\nWon\n\n\nArijit Singh for \"Deva Deva\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Female Playback Singer\n\nJonita Gandhi for \"Deva Deva\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nShreya Ghoshal for \"Rasiya\"\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Special Effects\n\nDNEG & Redefine\n\nWon\n\nFuture[edit]\nSequel[edit]\nBrahm\u0101stra: Part One \u2013 Shiva is intended to serve as the first installment of a planned trilogy, which is itself planned to be part of an extended cinematic universe titled Astraverse.[228] Media outlets noted the title of the film's sequel that is unveiled after its ending, Brahm\u0101stra: Part Two \u2013 Dev, serving as the second installment of the trilogy.
