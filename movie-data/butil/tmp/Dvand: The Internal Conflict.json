It stars Ishtiyak Khan, Sanjay Mishra, Vikram Kochhar and Ipshita Chakraborty. It was released theatrically on 29 September 2023.[1]\n\n\nCast[edit]\nIshtiyak Khan as Bhola\nVishwanath Chatterjee as Bhaiyaji\nSanjay Mishra as Guruji\nIpshitaa as Naini [2]\nTina Bhatia as Raziya\nVikram Kochhar\nFaiz Khan Raziya's husband\nProduction[edit]\nDvand: The Internal Conflict was shot in Jharkhand[3]\n\nPlot summary[edit]\nThe movie is a comedic adaptation of Shakespeare's play, \"Othello,\" combining elements of humor and adventure.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nA reviewer of The Free Press Journal wrote \"However, the internal conflict, competitive and jealousy in the minds of people can be watched at least once to encourage the makers\".[5] Ritu Tripati from India TV wrote \"it definitely feels like it has been drawn forcibly. But if you like realistic acting and down-to-earth characters then you will surely enjoy it\".[6] Rahul Chouhan from Aaj Tak wrote \"If you want to watch a serious 'low' comedy film showing social evils, then you will like 'Dwand The Internal Conflict'\".[7] Shikha Yadav from NDTV says \"Like the story of the film, its direction has also been done well. But at some places the story starts getting a bit slow and boring and looking at some scenes it seems as if an attempt has been made to add them forcefully\".[8] Priya Shukla from News18 India says \"However, at some places the story seems to be lax. There are some scenes which look as if there was no need for this scene. As if it was just added forcefully\".[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Sanjay Mishra's 'Dvand-The Internal Conflict' will be released on September 29, The first look poster launched\".
