It was announced, that Parineeti Chopra would play an undercover RAW agent in Ribhu Dasgupta's next. It is her second collaboration with Dasgupta post The Girl on the Train.[6][7]\nHarrdy Sandhu was cast opposite Chopra,[8] while Sharad Kelkar was cast as the main antagonist.[9]\nShooting of the film started in April 2021 in Turkey, including Istanbul, where a major portion of the film was shot.[10]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nCode Name: TirangaSoundtrack album by Jaidev Kumar and Vipin PatwaReleased1 November 2022Recorded2022StudioNeo Sounds & Saffron Touch StudioGenreRomanceSoundtrackLength13:40LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesProducerBhushan Kumar\nThe songs for the film are composed by Jaidev Kumar & Vipin Patwa and lyrics are penned by Kumaar, while a few lines of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's Vande Mataram have been borrowed for a song of the same name.

While praising the performance News 18 gave the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"Ribhu Dasgupta\u2019s direction film's script suffers from cliched and weak plot lines. It manages to engage the audience, taking full advantage of its breathtaking locations. Harrdy Sandhu is treat to watch while Parineeti Chopra slays as a RAW Agent.\"[13]\nTimes of India gave the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote, \"It\u2019s refreshing to watch Parineeti Chopra take on the villains with the sole intention of serving the country. Action choreography gets the maximum share of credit, as the story of this espionage thriller is quite predictable right from the beginning.\"[14] India Today gave the film 1.5 out of 5 and noted, \"Parineeti Chopra delivers a power-packed performance in Code Name: Tiranga. Her action scenes look flawless and well rehearsed. However, after a point, she fails to make an impact.\" They further noted, \"There was absolutely no research put in behind a film about the country\u2019s smartest, RAW\".[15]\nNDTV gave 1.5 out of 5 said, \"Code Name Tiranga, is a series of yawn-inducing gunfights interspersed with fleeting sequences in which the characters are given lines to speak. In a film that is literally all over the place, the actors have their jobs cut out. They struggle to rise above the deafening din and be heard and understood.\"[16] Firstpost gave 0.5 out of 5 and mentioned, \"Writing a woman as the lead in an actioner is the only good idea to be found in the entire length and breadth of this thrill-less espionage \u2018thriller\u2019, Code Name: Tiranga is a disaster. The wait continues.\"[17]\nScroll wrote, \"Except for a point-of-view sequence in which Durga storms Khalid\u2019s citadel, the 127-minute movie is too sluggishly staged to sell Parineeta Chopra as an action heroine. Harrdy Sandhu valiantly tries to be noticed in a film that is barely interested in him. The film isn\u2019t interested in its own subject matter either.[18] ABP News stated, \"Parineeti's performance in the film deserves a special mention. She lends the right kind of pragmatic depth to the otherwise films about spies' who mostly have a straight face in all situations.\"[19]\n\nBox office[edit]\nCode Name: Tiranga competed with the Ayushmann Khurrana-starred Doctor G, which was released on the same day.[20] The film collected \n\u20b90.15 crore at the domestic box office on its opening day. The film then collected \n\u20b90.15 crore on day 2 [21] and \u20b90.07 crore on day 5.[22] It ended its theatrical run on day 7 with a total collection of \u20b90.70 crore.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Code Name: Tiranga\".
