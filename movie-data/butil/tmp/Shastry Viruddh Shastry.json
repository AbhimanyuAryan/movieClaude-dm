Shastry Viruddh Shastry perhaps says that the era of the distant, inflexible father is drawing to an end, but until a workable model for the perfect dad \u2013 and the lax Malhar is not it \u2013 is created, kids will be tossed around and mothers will have to put up with it.\"[4]\nAbhishek Srivastava of The Times of India rated this film 3 stars out of 5 stars and said \"This emotionally charged film takes the viewer on a relatable journey, particularly for urban couples who can identify with the events portrayed.\"[5]\nPratikshya Mishra of The Quint rated this film 2.5 stars out of 5 stars and said \"In a battle between one generation that believes in \u2018Parampara Pratishtha Anushasan\u2019 and another that is trying to make a living in a cutthroat world that could lead to neglect, perhaps there can be no long term solutions.\"[6]\nSumit Rajguru of Times Now rated this film 2.5 stars out of 5 stars and said \"Overall, Shastry Viruddh Shastry is a movie that is high on performances but low on emotions. The main cast did a fine job, but the slow pace and predictable storyline make the film average.\"[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Paresh Rawal-starrer 'Shastry Virudh Shastry' to release on Nov 3\".
