The film  based on the life of former Test and ODI captain of the India women's national cricket team, Mithali Raj, stars Taapsee Pannu in title role. It chronicles ups and downs and moments of glory of Mithali's life. The film was released on 15 July 2022.[4] It received mixed to positive reviews from critics but was a major box-office disaster, grossing just under a tenth of its budget at the box office.[5][6]\n\n\nSynopsis[edit]\nMithali Raj is former Test and ODI captain of women's national cricket team. She led India to finals of 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup.\nThe film based on her life chronicles the events of her life's journey in the world of women cricket.

She said, \"Hoping that this movie inspires more people, especially young girls to take up sports as a career.\"[8]\nThe biopic was planned to shoot in 2019. Raj said, \"I think Priyanka Chopra will be a great choice (to play me in the biopic). Our personalities match a lot. I am not a movie buff, so I'd love the experts to do their job.\"[9] Finally it was Taapsee Pannu who was chosen to play the role of Mithali Raj in the biopic named as Shabaash Mithu, to be directed by Rahul Dholakia in 2020.[10]\n\nPreparation and training[edit]\nOn 3 December 2019, coinciding with the birthday of Mithali Raj, the film was finalized with Taapsee Pannu in the title role and Rahul Dholakia as director. In January 2021 Pannu posted her training photos from 3 December 2019, 29 January 2020 and 27 January 2021.[11] In March 2021, Taapsee Pannu again posted photos of her preparation and training for the film. She trained under Nooshin Al Khadeer, a former cricket player and Mithali Raj's friend. The film earlier was anticipated to be released on 5 February 2021 under direction of Rahul Dholakia, but filming was delayed due to COVID-19.[12]\nIn June Srijit Mukherji replaced Rahul Dholakia as director of the film due to change of schedule.[13][14]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on 5 April 2021[15] after being delayed due to COVID-19. Filming was finally wrapped up on 9 November. The film was shot on Lord's Cricket Ground in London,[16] and across domestic and international locations to bring real feel of actual events that happened in Mithali's life.[17]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nShabaash MithuSoundtrack album by Amit Trivedi, Salvage Audio Collective and CharanReleased20 June 2022[18]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength36:31LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesProducerBhushan KumarOfficial audioShabaash Mithu - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Amit Trivedi, Salvage Audio Collective and Charan.

It deserves to be watched for the journey of a woman, who is responsible for the incredible rise of Indian Women's cricket in the last two decades\".[26] Rachana Dubey of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \" The movie doesn't amply showcase those edge-of-the-seat, nail-biting moments that would have unfolded in her life, especially during the 2017 world cup\".[27] Himesh Mankad of Pinkvilla rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Shabaash Mithu deserves to be watched to witness the journey of a woman, who is responsible for the incredible rise of Indian Women's cricket in the last two decades - Mithali Raj\".[28] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Taapsee Pannu shines in a film that has no space for nuance. Director Srijit Mukerji ensures everything is underlined in this sports drama\".[29] Bollywood Hungama rated the film with 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"On the whole, Shabaash Mithu tells an inspiring tale of one of the greatest cricket legends in the world. At the box office, it has the potential to draw in audiences, especially in urban centres. It also deserves tax-free status.\"[30]\n[31]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Shabaash Mithu\".
