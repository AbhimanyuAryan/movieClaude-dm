He has acted in several television commercials. He belongs to a family of musicians and singers; his father is reputed ghazal singer Chandan Dass. His maternal grandfather was K. Pannalal, who worked for Delhi All India Radio and Doordarshan, and was a musician par excellence. One of his maternal uncles, Jaidev Kumar, is a famous Punjabi music director, and another is Ajay K. Pannalal, a Punjabi film director. Namit is also a trained singer and took classical-music training from his father Chandan Dass and Bhavdeep Jaipurwale, but preferred acting over singing for a long time. Recently he has released an album with Anurag Shanker, which has five tracks.\nNamit Das married his longtime girlfriend Shruti Vyas on 15 February 2015. Shruti herself is a theater and film actress and has appeared in many ads, including an OLX Womaniyan ad, where she was the face of OLX. She is the sister of actor Sumeet Vyas. Namit and Shruti got married in Mumbai in a traditional ceremony, graced by family and friends. Namit's younger brother Anshul Nautiyal is also an underground music producer who is Delhi-based.\n\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilms[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2009\nThe President Is Coming\nRamesh S.\n\n\n\nWake Up Sid\nRishi Atul Raheja\n\n\n\n2010\nLafangey Parindey\nChaddi\n\n\n\nPhillum City\nChaubey\n\n\n\n2011\nBulb Hila\n\n\n\n\nNithya\n\n\n\n\n2013\nGhanchakkar\nIdris\n\n\n\n2014\nAnkhon Dekhi\nAjju\n\n\n\n2015\nHamari Adhuri Kahani\nSaanjh Prasad (adult)\nCameo appearance\n\n\n2018\nSui Dhaaga \nGuddu\n\n\n\nPataakha\nJagan\n\n\n\n2019\nRakkhosh\nBirsa Voice Over\n\n\n\n2020\nBahut Hua Samman\nRajat Tiwari\n\n\n\n2021\nAafat-E-Ishq\nAtmaram\nZee5 film\n\n\n2023\nRocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani\nSumen Mitra\n\n\nTV series[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nSeries\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2004-05\nPancham\nPancham\n\n\n\n\n2008\nMumbai Calling\nAmar\n\n\n\n\n2010\nState of the Union\nIndian caller\n\n\n\n\nAxe Ur Ex\nHost\n\n\n\n\n2015\u20132016\nSumit Sambhal Lega\nSumit Walia\n\n\n\n\n2017\nKaushiki\nDK\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nTable No 5\n\n\n\nWeb Series [1][2]\n\n\n2019\n\nAbhay\n\nGovind\n\nWeb Series [3][4]\n\n\n2020\n\nAarya\n\nJawahar\n\nWeb Series\n\n\nA Suitable Boy\n\nHaresh Khanna\n\nBBC One[5] & Netflix\n\n\nMafia\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nWeb series[6]\n\n\n2022\n\nRocket Boys\n\nProsenjit Day\n\nSonyLIV\n\n\n2023\n\nChoona\n\nTriloki\n\nNetflix\n\nPlays[edit]\nDas has worked in a number of plays.[7]\n\n\n\nYear\n\nPlay\n\nDirector\n\nComments\n\n\n2002\nShadow Box\nNadir Khan\n\n\n\n2002\nNoises Off\nAtuI Kumar\n\n\n\n2003-04\nI Am Invincible (Clown Show)\nAtuI Kumar\n\n\n\n2004\nVoices\nAtuI Kumar\n\n\n\n2006\nMuch Ado About Nothing\nImogen Butler Cole\nAlso composed music[8]\n\n\n2006-07\nChairs\nAtuI Kumar\n\n\n\n2006-08\nNumbers In The Dark\nAtuI Kumar\n\n\n\n2007-\nThe President Is Coming\nKunal Roy Kapoor\n\n\n\n2007\nThe Soul Of A Sales Man\nEtiene Coutinho\n\n\n\n2007\nMastana Rampuri Urf Chappanchuri\nSunil Shanbag\n\n\n\n2008-11\nThe Shehenshah Of Azeemo\nSumeet & Shivani\n\n\n\n2008-11\nHamlet The Clown Prince\nRajat Kapoor\n\n\n\n2011-\nStories In A Song\nSunil Shanbag\n\n\n\n2011-\nBombay Talkies\nVikram Kapadia\n\n 2023 monsoon wedding the musical\nDubbing roles[edit]\nThis section needs expansion.
