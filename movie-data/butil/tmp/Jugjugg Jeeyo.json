The couple relocates to Toronto, Canada for Nainaa's job in a corporate company while Kukoo is employed as a bouncer in a nightclub. Within five years, the couple's marital life gets strained due to prolonged silences, unfinished conversations and resentful hearts while Nainaa is offered a new position as the vice-president of HR in New York City and Kukoo is frustrated with his job. On their wedding anniversary, Nainaa and Kukoo confess to each other about their stressed marital life and plan to divorce each other once Kukoo's sister Ginny is married. They fly to their hometown Patiala, India for attending Ginny's wedding with Baljeet and are received by Kukoo's happy parents Bheem and Geeta and Ginny. Nainaa and Kukoo pretend to be happy, unwilling to disturb the vibes of Ginny's marriage while Ginny has conflicted feelings for her former boyfriend, Gaurav.\nAs Nainaa's boss urges her to decide soon about her promotion, she insists Kukoo to reveal about their divorce plan to his parents. Kukoo parties with his father Bheem and tries to tell him about his plans to get separated from Nainaa but rather learns that Bheem intends to divorce Geeta after Ginny's wedding. Puzzled, Kukoo attempts to confront Bheem and is informed of the latter's extra-marital affair with Kukoo's mathematics teacher in 12th grade, Meera. Meanwhile, Nainaa becomes frustrated when the women of the house arrange for a small prayer for her to bear children and angrily discloses about her plans to get separated from Kukoo to her mother and Geeta. Next morning, a shocked Geeta confronts Kukoo and Nainaa and tries convincing them to sort their problems out. Frustrated when Bheem tries to do the same as Geeta, Kukoo reveals Bheem's affair with Meera to Geeta and Nainaa, shattering the former while Bheem fakes a heart stroke to earn sympathy and requests the doctor, their family friend, to play along with his act.\nMeanwhile, Geeta plans to unite Bheem and Meera after Ginny's wedding and informs them, Nainaa and Kukoo of the same at a temple much to everyone's despair. Due to Geeta's act, Kukoo picks up an argument with her and Nainaa at home, leaves the house and drinks with Gurpreet, his best friend, confidant and Nainaa's elder brother. At night, Bheem leaves the house to live with Meera but the latter doesn't wish to be with him as she feels that she could never be like Geeta. When Kukoo meets Bheem on the road, the latter pretends to have left Meera for good and realized that Geeta is his better half. Convinced of his act, Geeta forgives Bheem while Ginny, who is unaware of all the drama taking place at her home, arranges for her parents to renew their wedding vows on the occasion of their wedding anniversary. On the day of Geeta and Bheem's re-wedding, Kukoo and Gurpreet call Meera to mock her as Bheem \"kicked her out\" in favour of Geeta but realize that it was Meera who rejected Bheem. Infuriated by his father, Kukoo simultaneously discloses it all publicly and insults Bheem, for which Geeta slaps Kukoo but ultimately decides to file for divorce.\nHaving learnt of Kukoo and Nainaa's plans of divorce and her parents' conflict, Ginny bursts out about her insecurity in marrying Baljeet as she still loves someone else while she was all along ready to marry Baljeet as Geeta had once assured her that everything would be right after marriage whereas it did not work out for both the couples. The divorce proceedings begin for both the couples. While Bheem and Geeta are given six months by the court to reconsider, Kukoo refuses to accept for divorce, apologizing to Nainaa for not being part of her success all along and being jealous of it instead. They reconcile and set to leave for New York City while Bheem plans to reconcile with Geeta within these six months, having realized his selfishness and also thinks of having Ginny marry Gaurav.\n\nCast[edit]\nNeetu Kapoor as Geeta Saini[8]\nAnil Kapoor as Bheem Saini\nVarun Dhawan as Kuldeep \"Kukoo\" Saini\nKiara Advani as Nainaa Sharma Saini\nManish Paul as Gurpreet Sharma[9][10]\nPrajakta Koli as Ginny Saini[11]\nTisca Chopra as Meera Malhotra[12]\nVarun Sood as Gaurav Kapoor\nSavant Singh Premi as Baljeet \"Ballu\" Sodhi\nNaman Arora as Vishal Verma\nSuparna Marwah as Nainaa and Gurpreet's mother\nElnaaz Norouzi - special appearance in the song \"Duppata\"[13]\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced on 16 November 2020 in Chandigarh.[14][15] The shooting wrapped up in November 2021.[16]\n\nRelease[edit]\nJugjugg Jeeyo was released in theatres on 24 June 2022 in 3,375 screens with 11,384 shows per day.[17] It premiered digitally on 22 July 2022 on Amazon Prime Video.[18]\n\nLawsuit[edit]\nOn 21 June 2022, Vishal Singh, a writer from Ranchi, India, accused Karan Johar of plagiarizing the plot for Jugjugg Jeeyo.
