She continues to tell him that Dhruv leaves home late at night same as when he leaves for his late night shift.\nNikhil rings his son and somehow makes him understand and return home quickly. But before that the mysterious women who called Nikhil threatening suicide reaches his house and holds Prerna captive. The woman forces Prerna to sit in her car and calls Nikhil after having a second conversation he realizes that she is Seema Palav whose son died in hit a run case and a rich spoilt brat Yash Mehra's car was the one that hit him. The case got shut down due to pressure from the city's big wigs and the woman thinks Dhruv also had a hand in it.\nSeema's motive is only revenge by killing Yash, hence the reason she has kidnapped Prerna. She wants Dhruv to get Yash to her. Dhruv brings Yash to the car where Seema is waiting for him. Nikhil also reached the place. \nIn the final scene, Seema shoots both Yash and Dhruv while Nikhil shoots Seema. Yash survives but Dhruv is dead. In the end, similarly, Yash's parents are seen offering money to Nikhil to close the case. Nikhil returns to his Control Room to report the entire case, not falling for the money and the story ends.\n\nCast[edit]\nManoj Bajpayee as Senior Inspector Nikhil Sood\nNeena Gupta as Seema Paalav\nSakshi Tanwar as Prerna Sood, Nikhil's wife\nNandu Madhav as Chandrakant Paalav aka Chandu, Seema's husband\nAbhijeet Chavan as Inspector Gharat\nUrmila Mahanta as Gayatri\nVikram Bham as Najeeb\nMadhur Arora as Suresh Nayak\nDeepanshu Titoriya as Avi\nGirish Dixit as Ashish Deshmukh\nVirandra Giri as Sangha\nSvar Kamble as Dhruv Sood, Nikhil's son\nIvan Sylvester Rodrigues as Gautam Mehra\nNilesh Mamgain as Gulam Ahmed\nAman Gandotra as Yash Mehra, Gautam's son\nProduction[edit]\nThe Principal photography commenced on 1 December 2020 in Mumbai.[5][6][7]\n\nReception[edit]\nRahul Desai of Film Companion wrote, \"Even though Dial 100 gets its nihilistic messaging on point, the gimmicky execution ensures the film is about as surprising as a traffic jam in Andheri East.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Dial 100 trailer out.
