Principal photography began in December 2018 and was wrapped in September\u00a02019.[8]\nSet for an initial release on 15\u00a0November 2019, the film was postponed and released theatrically in India on 21\u00a0February 2020.[9] It eventually received negative reviews and was a commercial failure.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nMeera's third birthday is celebrated on the Sea-Bird by the ship's merchant crew. Drawn away from the party by a sound, Meera is attacked by a ghost and screams. Years later, shipping officer Prithvi Maurya (Vicky Kaushal), with the help of friend and colleague Riaz, elopes with his pregnant girlfriend Sapna. Prithvi foils a human trafficking operation but Riaz warns him against such dangerous adventures. Prithvi and Sapna give birth to a baby girl, Megha, and are shown raising her.\nSometime later, Prithvi is living alone. He and Riaz investigate the Sea-Bird, which was mysteriously found abandoned at an unmanned port, and recover its logbook. A couple is shown having a romantic adventure on the ship before being killed by a ghost. The body of a girl is found buried on the beach. Prithvi and Riaz attempt to tow the Sea-Bird for disposal, but their salvage ship is damaged. Prithvi is injured saving a drowning man and sees a girl through a hole in the ship.\nWhile recovering, Prithvi hallucinates of the ship and his wife and daughter. In a flashback, it is revealed that they drowned due to improper safety equipment on a river-rafting vacation he had planned. Disturbed, he consults with Professor Joshi (Ashutosh Rana), who is researching the afterlife and has hallucinations of his own dead wife and daughter. Prithvi returns to the ship and finds a video camera in the engine room; the ghost attacks him but he is saved by Riaz.\nPrithvi comes to believe that the girl he saw is Meera and that she has been possessed by the ghost for 11 years. He brings his findings to Joshi who advises him to identify the ghost; Riaz is wary, knowing this is well beyond their duty. Prithvi learns that the crew of the ship committed suicide, except for Meera and her mother, and grows suspicious of an unidentified man amongst the crew. Prithvi and Riaz meet the mother, Vandana (Meher Vij), and play the video of Meera's birthday party. Vandana reveals that the Sea-Bird was involved in drug smuggling and other illegal activities and that the unknown man, Amar, stopped her from committing suicide after the captain had assaulted her.  Vandana says that she and Amar fell in love and planned to flee, recording the captain's illegal activities to expose him, but that Amar was caught and died following torture.\nIn order to free Meera, Vandana agrees to show the shipping officers a secret room on the ship.  Along with Joshi, they go to the ship the night before it is to be towed away. They fight the ghost, and during the encounter, it is revealed that Vandana killed Amar to save herself. Vandana and Joshi are killed, and Riaz spills the diesel fuel. Prithvi finds the secret room where Amar's corpse is hanging. He burns the body, dispelling the ghost. Prithvi rescues Meera and they escape through the hole in the ship.\nIn the epilogue, Prithvi teaches Meera how to eat noodles.  In an additional scene in the mid-credits, a black figure is seen moving around Prithvi's home.\n\nCast[edit]\nVicky Kaushal as Prithvi Maurya\nBhumi Pednekar as Sapna Prakashan\nInayah Chowdhry as Meera\nAkash Dhar[10] as Riaz\nAshutosh Rana as Professor Raghuveer Joshi\nSiddhanth Kapoor as Captain Siddharth Roy\nMeher Vij as Vandana\nPriya Chauhan as Nilofer\nProduction[edit]\nIn January 2018, it was reported that Kaushal and Pednekar had signed to perform in a horror film produced by Karan Johar.[11] The filming began in December\u00a02018, with Kaushal, while Pednekar filmed her portions in late January.[12] Kaushal fractured his cheekbone while shooting for an action sequence in Gujarat.

I thought at maximum, I'd hear a no from him (Varma) but let me call him. And I was just blown by his generosity. I called him and I spoke to him and he was like, 'Yeah, take it and whatever paperwork you will need, just let me know'. It was like in two seconds that he gave me the title. I've been in this industry for 25 years but I haven't seen this kind of generosity before. ... This is the first of its kind. I am grateful that Vicky headlined the film with us because that gives us a lot of confidence that such films can be made.
