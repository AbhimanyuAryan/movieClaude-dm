Bastar: The Naxal Story seeks to reduce it to bullet points and stereotypes.\"[20]\nRohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Bastar: The Naxal Story is a sloppy docudrama that is away from thrill, adventure and drama\".[21]\nZinia Bandyopadhyay of India Today gave 1/5 stars and wrote that Bastar is \"Sensational, oversimplified film with no nuance\".[22]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated 0.5/5 stars and wrote \"To expect any kind of nuance from the makers of The Kerala Story would have been a stretch. Bastar is more of the same.\"[23]\nSamvartha Sahil of Deccan Herald rated 0.5/5 stars and wrote \"Sudipto Sen\u2019s new feature film Bastar: The Naxal Story lacks not just an understanding of a complex political situation, and its larger socio-economic undercurrents, but also of constructing a compelling narrative.\"[24]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Bastar (18)\".
