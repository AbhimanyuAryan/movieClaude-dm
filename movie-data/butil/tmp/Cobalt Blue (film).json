It is adapted from the novel of the same name that follows the story of a brother and sister who fall in love with the same man and the ensuing events that shatter their traditional conservative family.[2] The film was released on 2 April 2022 after some initial delays.[3][4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nWhen an aspiring author Tanay (Neelay Mehendale) and his free-spirited sister Anuja (Anjali Sivaraman) both fall for the enigmatic paying guest at their home (Prateik Babbar) the ensuing events rock their traditional Indian family. Set in the 1990s the movie examines aspects of loneliness, same-sex love and the free spirit of transcending societal barriers.\n\nCast[edit]\nPrateik Babbar as Paying Guest\nDr. Neelay Mehendale as Tanay Vidhyadhar Dixit\nAnant V Joshi as Aseem Dixit\nAnjali Sivaraman as Anuja Dixit\nPoornima Indrajith as Sister Mary\nNeil Bhoopalam as Professor (literature)\nGeetanjali Kulkarni as Sharda Dixit\nShishir Sharma as Mr. Dixit\nRelease[edit]\nIn November 2018, it was announced that the novel Cobalt Blue would be adapted into a feature film for Netflix. It was written and directed by Kundalkar.[5] It was originally scheduled for streaming on 3 December 2021 but postponed and was released on 2 April 2022.[6]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritic Response[edit]\nNandini Ramnath from Scroll.in gave a positive review of the film's writing, \"Neelay Mehendale's delicate characterisation of Tanay and Prateik Babbar's overt hunkiness create the film's most memorable moments, which have the vividness of primary colours and the erotic flush of first love.\"[7] Deccan Herald gave the film 3/5 stars and wrote, \"The movie has heartwarming Hindi poetry catering to various shades of emotions. The entire movie is a slow, lyrical and heartbreaking journey blended with literature, poetry, music and art. Primary hues have been effectively used to bring out emotions.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Cobalt Blue\". British Board of Film Classification.
