Stearn (16\u00a0April 1911\u00a0\u2013 9\u00a0May 2001) was a British botanist. Born in Cambridge, he was largely self-educated. He was head librarian at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library in London from 1933 to 1952, and then moved to the Natural History Museum where he was a scientific officer in the botany department until 1976. After retirement, he became the president of the Linnean Society and taught botany at Cambridge University. He is known for his work in botanical taxonomy, history, and illustration, and for his studies of the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. Stearn is the author of Botanical Latin, as well as the Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners, a popular guide to the scientific names of plants. He is considered one of the most eminent British botanists of his time. An essay prize in his name from the Society for the History of Natural History is awarded each year.

Grandville. He has been called \"the first star of French caricature's great age\", and Grandville's book illustrations described as featuring \"elements of the symbolic, dreamlike, and incongruous, and they retain a sense of social commentary\". The anthropomorphic vegetables and zoomorphic figures that populated his cartoons anticipated and influenced the work of generations of cartoonists and illustrators including John Tenniel, Gustave Dor\u00e9, F\u00e9licien Rops, and Walt Disney. He has also been called a \"proto-surrealist\" and was greatly admired by Andr\u00e9 Breton and others in the Surrealist movement. This illustration by Grandville is plate\u00a052 from a 1854 collection of hand-coloured lithographs titled Les m\u00e9tamorphoses du jour (The Metamorphoses of the Day), and depicts five anthropomorphic male dogs following a female dog, all dressed in human clothing. The print is captioned \"Temps de canicule\", meaning 'heatwave weather' but incorporating a pun in French; canicule literally translates to 'dog days of summer' and may also refer here to animals being 'in heat'.\n\nIllustration credit: Jean Ignace Isidore G\u00e9rard; restored by Adam Cuerden\n\nRecently featured: \nNotre-Dame de Paris fire\nNassarius arcularia\nGalena\n\n\nArchive\nMore featured pictures\n\n\n\n\nOther areas of Wikipedia\n\nCommunity portal \u2013 The central hub for editors, with resources, links, tasks, and announcements.\nVillage pump \u2013 Forum for discussions about Wikipedia itself, including policies and technical issues.\nSite news \u2013 Sources of news about Wikipedia and the broader Wikimedia movement.\nTeahouse \u2013 Ask basic questions about using or editing Wikipedia.\nHelp desk \u2013 Ask questions about using or editing Wikipedia.\nReference desk \u2013 Ask research questions about encyclopedic topics.\nContent portals \u2013 A unique way to navigate the encyclopedia.\n\nWikipedia's sister projects\n\nWikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects:\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonsFree media repository\n\n\n\nMediaWikiWiki software development\n\n\n\nMeta-WikiWikimedia project coordination\n\n\n\nWikibooksFree textbooks and manuals\n\n\n\nWikidataFree knowledge base\n\n\n\nWikinewsFree-content news\n\n\n\nWikiquoteCollection of quotations\n\n\n\nWikisourceFree-content library\n\n\n\nWikispeciesDirectory of species\n\n\n\nWikiversityFree learning tools\n\n\n\nWikivoyageFree travel guide\n\n\n\nWiktionaryDictionary and thesaurus\n\n\n\nWikipedia languages\n\n\nThis Wikipedia is written in English.
