It also gives a nice tribute to the small-town journalists who often risk their lives while trying to break stories that matter.\"[11]\nPooja Darade from Koimoi rated the film a good 3.5/5 stars and said \"Bhakshak has a feminist tone to it without once being loud about the same\". She went on to say \"The film serves as a reminder of what power the right kind of journalism holds and how we\u2019re in ruins because that\u2019s completely missing today\".[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Bhakshak (15)\".
