It is directed, co-written, and co-produced by Randeep Hooda, who also plays the titular role of Savarkar.[4][5] It was released in theatres on 22 March 2024.[6][7]\nThe film has been criticised for distorting history and for promoting one-sided agenda[8][9][10][11] but received praises for its actors' performances.[12][13]\n\n\nPlot\nThe film narrates the life of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, beginning with the backdrop of the Bubonic plague of 1897, which claims his father's life. Angered by injustices, Vinayak becomes a revolutionary, inspired by figures like Shivaji Maharaj and Mazzini. He founds the secret society Abhinav Bharat Society and later joins Indian revolutionaries in London at the India House. Vinayak completes his thesis on the 1857 War of Independence, and secretly dispatches weapons to India. He meets Mohandas Gandhi but finds their approaches different. As India witnesses various revolutionary acts, the Savarkar brothers\u2014Vinayak and  Ganesh Damodar Savarkar\n\u2014are arrested, and imprisonend in the infamous Kalapani in Andaman.\nIn prison, the Savarkar brothers face brutal treatment, including solitary confinement and physical abuse. Despite hardships, Vinayak continues his struggle, advocating for better conditions for political prisoners. After years of imprisonment, Vinayak is released but faces restrictions. He coins the term Hindutva and continues his activism, challenging casteism and advocating for a united India. He refuses to support Gandhi's Quit India Movement, fearing partition, and urges Hindus to prepare for military defense. As India moves towards independence, the film delves on the partition, the Naval Mutiny, and Gandhi's assassination.\n\nCast\nRandeep Hooda as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar\nVarun Buddhadev as young Veer Savarkar\nAnkita Lokhande as Yamunabai Savarkar\nAmit Sial as Ganesh Damodar Savarkar\nTirrtha Murbaadkar as Saraswatibai Savarkar\nChetan Swaroop as Narayan Damodar Savarkar\nRajesh Khera as Mahatma Gandhi\nLokesh Mittal as B.

While one can't claim authenticity of everything shown in the film, this interpretation of Savarkar's life by Randeep Hooda and the team of Swatantrya Veer Savarkar makes for great, engaging cinema.\"[12]\nCatherine Bray of The Guardian gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated, \"It all adds up to a funny mixture of hagiography and limp film-making, albeit built around a fine central performance.\"[21]\nAnuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote \"The film attempts to uplift Savarkar in the popular imagination by vilifying Gandhi through a stylistically mounted and carefully crafted narrative\".[22]\nIn the review for Indian Express, Shubhra Gupta gave a rating of 2/5 and described the movie as \"stridently one-sided, and, ultimately, reductive\".[9]\nDishya Sharma of News 18 rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"In a sea of patriotic films that Bollywood has been releasing in recent years, Swatantra Veer Savarkar is among the better ones. The production value of the film and the performances keep you seated through the three-hour watch. I wish it was edited well, for there were a few scenes that could have been done away with. This would have given the film a lasting impact.\"[13]\nRohit Bhatnagar of Free Press Journal gave a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Randeep\u2019s film is a slow burner and it drains you with facts and figures but it is a well-intended project that might strictly excite and appeal history lovers.\" The review finds the movie to be \"bothersome\" and to have distorted historical realities.[23]\nSana Farzeen of India Today rated 2 out of 5 stars and added that \"Swatantrya Veer Savarkar turned out to be a shallow attempt. It can be only passed off as a very long, often one-sided history lesson on the 'neglected' freedom fighter.\"[11]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times writes in her review that the film \"ends up being a one-sided narrative that's not bothered about presenting a balanced outlook about the contributions made towards India's struggle for freedom.[10]\nPrateek Sur of the Outlook gave 2.5/5 stars and stated that, \"\u2018Swatantrya Veer Savarkar\u2019 is a wasted effort to be honest. The performances of the other characters could have been lifted and given much more weightage than it currently got. Not to forget that its already too long and yet you feel that there are many angles that have been missed out. So, a possibility of having the film releasing two parts or probably as a web series would have been better.\"[24]\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Swatantrya Veer Savarkar (12A)\".
