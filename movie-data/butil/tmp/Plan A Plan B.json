On one of her arranged marriages, Nirali's mother announces her retirement and hands over the business to Nirali. She also tells Nirali that she has already booked a shared working space and paid for it for a year. On the day she moves in, she finds out that her office is right next to the office of Kaustubh 'Kosty' Chogule, a divorce lawyer. Now both of them have to live in shared spaced office while interacting with each other.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nRiteish Deshmukh as Advocate Kaustubh Chougule (Kosty)\nTamannaah Bhatia as Dr. Nirali Vora\nKusha Kapila as Seema\nPoonam Dhillon as Kiran Vora\nPooja Singh as Taruna\nBidita Bag as Mrs Runjhun Chougule\nHeli Vyas as Serena\nNeeta Mohindra as Pushpa (Pussy) aunty\nDilshad Patel as Preeti\nRelease[edit]\nThe film released on 30 September 2022 via Netflix.[2]\n\nReception[edit]\nSaibal Chatterji of NDTV wrote, \"Plan A Plan B is a rom-com that skims the surface of matters of the heart as men and women, whether entering into matrimony or opting out of it, negotiate the sharp bends on the way. The film potters around without much of a roadmap. The result is a flimsy affair that leaves far too much to the actors to salvage\".[3] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote, \"I had hopes that there would be some zest to the proceedings [...] But as soon as the attraction-despite-everything arc begins, the film turns decisively tepid and flat\".[4] Archika Khurana of The Times of India wrote, \"For people to believe that \"opposites attract,\" this 106-minute film is as formulaic as it is ambitious\".[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Riteish Deshmukh to make digital debut with Netflix film Plan A Plan B\".
