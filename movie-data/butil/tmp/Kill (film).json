It stars Lakshya, Raghav Juyal, Ashish Vidyarthi, Harsh Chhaya and Tanya Maniktala.[1][2][3][4]\nKill was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2023, where it was first runner-up for the People's Choice Award: Midnight Madness.[5][6][7][8] The film is scheduled to be theatrically released in India on 5 July 2024.\n\n\nPremise[edit]\nAmrit, a commando in the Indian Army, and his friend Viresh embark on a train journey to rescue Amrit's girlfriend Tulika from an arranged marriage, but the plan goes awry as the train gets stormed by Beni and his gang of bandits. With the passengers' lives at risk, Amrit and Viresh set out to rescue the passengers by taking out Beni and the bandits using violent ways.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nLakshya as Amrit\nRaghav Juyal as Fani\nTanya Maniktala as Tulika\nAbhishek Chauhan as Viresh\nAshish Vidyarthi as Beni\nAdrija Sinha as Aahna\nHarsh Chhaya as Baldev Singh Thakur\nParth Tiwari as Siddhi\n\nProduction[edit]\nLess than a month prior to its premiere at Toronto, Dharma Productions and Sikhya Entertainment announced the film Kill to be directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, as the first in a content partnership announced in May 2023.[9]\n\nRelease[edit]\nKill premiered in the Midnight Madness section of the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2023. The film is scheduled for a theatrical release in India on 5 July 2024.[10][11][12] In October 2023, Lionsgate acquired distribution rights to the film for North America and the United Kingdom, marking one of the first instances of a Hollywood studio acquiring a Hindi-language film to directly release in the United States.[13][14][15] Lionsgate, in association with Roadside Attractions, later scheduled the film for a theatrical release in the United States on 4 July 2024, a day before its release in India.[16]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nNate Richard of Collider wrote \"Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's aggressively violent action flick is destined to become a cult classic.\"[17] Peter Debruge of Variety wrote \"As brutal a film as the country has ever produced, Kill is a shockingly graphic action showcase from an industry that typically plays violence in a more cartoony register.\"[18] Shakyl Lambert of CGMagazine wrote \"Kill is one of the best action films of the year, and action fans need to keep this one on their radar.\"[19] Matt Donato of /Film rated the film 9 stars out of 10. He also stated \"No joyous Bollywood dance interludes \u2014 this isn't \"RRR.\" Bhat's sublimely savage Kill has more in common with take-no-prisoners Indonesian badassery like The Night Comes for Us or The Raid, accentuating breakneck violence that flows like a gushing river of blood from gaping knife wounds.\"[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kill Movie (2024) | Release Date, Review, Cast, Trailer\".
