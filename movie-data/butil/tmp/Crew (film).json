The staff have not being paid their salaries in months, and the three friends, as all the other employees, keep hoping that things would change. Geeta's husband Arun runs a struggling food business from home. Geeta has to financially support her unemployed brother and his wife, as well. Jasmine has been raised by her maternal grandfather (Nanu) after her parents divorced. She does not believe in relationships, is fond of expensive things, and flaunts a fake and flashy lifestyle on social media. Divya was trained to be a pilor but forced to take up the job of a flight attendant due to lack of openings and keeps this hidden from her family. She struggles to repay her education loan instalments.\nThe death of senior flight attendant Rajvanshi, while on duty, leads the Geeta, Jasmine and Divya towards a clandestine operation to smuggle gold out of India to Al Burj (fictitious country). Mr. Mittal, the HR Head of Kohinoor Airlines, is the kingpin of the operation. The three of them become part of the gold smuggling operation and their financial situation soon improves: Geeta funds Arun\u2019s food business and her brother and his wife. Jasmine gets back Nanu\u2019s gold ring from the pawn shop and buys a BMW for herself. Divya repays her education loan. The other employees of the airline are still trying to make ends meet. Someone tips the customs officials that the three flight attendants are smuggling gold; and even though the three of them are able to hide their stash, the detention that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice.\nThe situation takes a drastic turn when Kohinoor Airlines is declared bankrupt and all employees are left unpaid and penniless. Vijay Walia, the airlines owner has fled to Al Burj. Geeta, Jasmine, and Divya realise that it was Vijay Walia\u2019s their gold smuggling operation is what helped Walia settle down comfortably in Al Burj.
