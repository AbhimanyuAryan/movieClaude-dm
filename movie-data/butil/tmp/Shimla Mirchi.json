His family also encounters Naina in another scene and likes her very much and wants Avi to marry her. To court Naina, Avi stays around the temple and works at her coffee shop that is about to open.\nNaina's parents have separated for long. Her father Tilak even has a new girlfriend around her age. However, her mother Rukmini is always unwilling to sign the divorce paper because she still loves Tilak, and she is having depression due to the situation.\nAvi successfully befriends Naina, and sends her an anonymous love letter, which however annoys her but gives her and idea to cheer up her mom. She writes the same letter to her mom, which successfully cheers up the latter and Rukmini decides to find the secret lover.\nMeanwhile, Naina gets suspicious about Avi's over-excellence in the job, assuming he is not here to work for her, but to gradually take over the cafe. She fires him, but he says he will stay another month because according to the law, an employer must not fire an employee without noticing him in advance for at least a month.\nAccidentally, Rukmini mistakes Avi as her secret lover. Naina therefore request Avi to help, by pretending to be the secret lover for a few days. Avi agrees.\nAfter that, Avi realizes Naina is not interested in him at all, and even gets angry when receiving his love letter and that she just wants to use him to cheer up her mom. Upset Avi leaves Naina, but tells her that he was her actual secret lover before leaving.\nRukmini also realizes that Avi loves Naina, and Naina finds out that she loves Avi too. Some time later, Naina receives wedding invitation from Avi. Shocked Naina immediately visits Avi, and asks him to cancel the wedding and marry her instead. Avi agrees.\nIt is finally revealed that Avi was not actually going to marry. The wedding invitation is a plan made up with by Rukmini to re-unite the two lovers. Later in Avi and Naina's wedding, Rukmini meets and reconciles with one of her former lover (Dharmendra).\n\nCast[edit]\nHema Malini as Rukmini \"Mini\"\nRajkummar Rao as Avinash \"Avi\"\nRakul Preet Singh as Naina\nShakti Kapoor as Captain Uncle\nKiran Juneja as Kannu Bua\nKanwaljit Singh as Tilak \"Tiku\"\nKamlesh Gill as Daadi\nTarun Wadhwa as Jude\nPriya Raina as Sonu\nTawhid Rike Zaman as Naina's Friend\nJagruti Sethia as Mishti\nNita Mohindra as Avinash's mother\nZoya Khan as Brownie\nDharmendra as a guest appearance, Foreign Minister\nRamesh Sippy as a guest appearance, a person reading a book on the bench\nRelease[edit]\nIt was theatrically released in India on 3 January 2020. And it was made available on Netflix on 27 January 2020.\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\nDevesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Ramesh Sippy made films in an era where the narrative took its own time unspooling. Though the length of the film is two hours and 15 minutes, this unhurried style of filmmaking makes it appear longer than the actual length. He added \"There's nothing in Rajkummar's and Rakul Preet's love story that we haven't seen before. They make for an interesting pair alright but are following a tried and tested path\".[9] Similarly, Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in rated the film 2.5/5 and wrote \"Completed five years ago and out in theatres only now, Shimla Mirchi feels resolutely old-fashioned (which isn\u2019t a bad thing at all) but also fusty (which is)\".[10]\nRating the film 2/5, Reza Noorani of The Times of India wrote \"Shimla Mirchi' is a bland romantic comedy that needed tighter editing and a better climax. It has an interesting plot with multiple possibilities that could have added flavour to the narrative. But they remain underexplored and the result is an uninspiring, two-hour- long movie that doesn't quite manage to tickle your funny bone\".[11]\nKennith Rosario of The Hindu wrote \"This supposedly funny plot is so flat that the most amusing part of the film is meta product placements of Kent water purifiers, which Malini endorses in real life\".[12]\nUmesh Punwani of Koimoi rated the film 1/5 and concluded \"All said and done, Shimla Mirchi is a \u2018raat gayi baat gayi\u2019 film. Now it\u2019s evident why the makers weren\u2019t getting any buyers for years now because the movie has no strong content to attract the audience. Totally skip it!\".[13]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nShimla MirchiSoundtrack album by Meet Bros AnjjanReleased6 January 2020[14]Recorded2014\u20132015GenreFeature film soundtrackLength18:23LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyExternal audio Official Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThis film's soundtrack is composed by Meet Bros Anjjan with lyrics written by Kumaar.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Sau Galtiyan\"Meet Bros Anjjan, Yasser Desai, Khushboo Grewal6:372.\"Ishq Di Feeling\"Meet Bros Anjjan, Stebin Ben4:383.\"Mirchi Shimle Di\"Meet Bros Anjjan, Khushboo Grewal, Sanjay Mishra3:354.\"Mainu Rang Lageya\"Meet Bros, Piyush Mehroliyaa3:33Total length:18:23\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Shimla Mirchi Trailer: Hema Malini, Rajkummar Rao And Rakul Preet Singh In An Unusual Love Story\".
