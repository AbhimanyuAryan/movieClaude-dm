Produced by Ronnie Screwvala, under the banner of RSVP Movies.[7] It stars Vicky Kaushal in the title role, alongside Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra, Neeraj Kabi, Edward Sonnenblick and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub.[8]\nThe film was released on 1 December 2023 and it earned \u20b9128.17 crore (US$16\u00a0million) worldwide. At the 69th Filmfare Awards, the film received eight nominations, including Best Film (Critics), Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics) (both for Kaushal).\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn 1934, Cadet Sam Manekshaw is amongst the first batch of gentleman cadets to be trained at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun; amongst his batchmates is his junior-rival, Tikka Khan. Graduating from the academy that year, he is posted as a second lieutenant to the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, Ferozpur. Soon after his appointment, he meets Siloo Bode, whom he later marries. In 1942, during the Second World War, Manekshaw, promoted to the acting rank of major, is sent with the regiment to participate in the Burma campaign. During the Battle of Sittang Bridge, he is wounded in action but survives and is awarded the Military Cross for gallantry.\nIn 1947, amidst the partition of the British Indian Army, Major Manekshaw is approached to join the Pakistan Army by his colleague, Yahya Khan; he chooses the Indian Army instead. Upon independence, discord emanates between the two countries over the sovereignty of Kashmir. In October 1947, Pakistan launches its military campaign to capture the region. In response, Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and home minister Vallabhbhai Patel dispatch Manekshaw and V. P. Menon to Kashmir; they succeed in securing the accession of Kashmir to India. India counter-attacks, but the war concludes in a stalemate.\nIn 1959, Manekshaw, now a major general and Commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, is approached by defence minister V. K. Krishna Menon and Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Brij Mohan Kaul of his opinion on the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen. K. S. Thimayya. Manekshaw, interpreting their actions as political interference, rebuffs them. However, Kaul conspires to stop Manekshaw's upcoming promotion by orchestrating a court-martial on the basis of impropriety; nevertheless, but Manekshaw is exonerated by his superiors.\nIn 1962, the Sino-Indian War erupts, leading to the army being trounced by the Chinese; Kaul resigns while Nehru dismisses Menon. On the advice of  Indira Gandhi, Nehru has Manekshaw promoted to lieutenant-general and assigns him as commanding officer of the IV Corps, Tezpur. He proposes an advance, but Nehru, forlorn from defeat, refuses; Indira intercedes in Manekshaw's favour. By 1963, Manekshaw manages to re-rally his troops in the North-East Frontier Agency. In 1964, Nehru dies, and Manekshaw is promoted as general commanding officer of the Eastern Command; two years later, Indira is appointed prime minister. Between 1965 and 1967, Manekshaw involves himself in the anti-insurgency operations against the Mizo National Front, for which he earns the Padma Bhushan.\nIn 1969, with discord amongst the Bengalis in East Pakistan rising, Yahya, now a general, is made Pakistan's president; elsewhere, Manekshaw is appointed as the Indian Army's next COAS and promoted to general as well. In 1970, the East Pakistan-based Awami League sweep Pakistan's general elections, however Yahya refuses to cede power to them, resulting in anti-government protests across Pakistan. In response, Yahya authorises Tikka, now a lieutenant-general, to initiate Operation Searchlight \u2013 a massive anti-Bengali pogrom, which he executes with ruthless efficiency. Considering the situation, Indira favours war, but Manekshaw opposes it, highlighting the army's hindrances; she agrees to wait. The U.S. warns Indira against war, but she rebuffs them. The army is mobilised and begins training the Mukti Bahini.\nOn 3 December 1971, Pakistan strikes first, launching pre-emptive attacks on Indian territory. India immediately responds with counter-attacks in Pakistan's western and eastern sectors. The opposing armies witness profound clashes, with Pakistan bearing numerous casualties on land, sea and air in both sectors. By 16 December, the Pakistani troops in the east, overwhelmed, surrender to the Eastern Command \u2013 ending the war. The conclusion cedes a political triumph to Indira while Yahya resigns from the humiliation of defeat. With Manekshaw's retirement approaching, Indira has him to be promoted to the rank of field-marshal in recognition of his wartime leadership; he proudly retires in January 1973.\n\nCast[edit]\nIndian Army[edit]\n\nVicky Kaushal as Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, the 7th Chief of the Army Staff, Indian Army.\nJiyana Kapadia as Baby Sam\nBobby Arora as Major O.

Kaushal impressed by the idea decided that he would play the character.[9] She then went for years of extensive research and writing collaborating with Bhavani Iyer and Shantanu Srivastava, also meeting with family members of Sam Manekshaw.[10][11] The film marks the second collaboration between Gulzar and Kaushal. In 2021, the film was announced by RSVP Movies on the 107th birth anniversary of late Sam Manekshaw.[12][13]\nThe film was filmed with real Indian army personnel.[14][15]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIn December 2021, Shaikh and Malhotra joined the cast, marking their second collaboration after their debut film, Dangal.[16][17] Kabi joined the cast in September 2022 to portray the role of Jawaharlal Nehru marking his second collaboration with Gulzar after Talvar.[18] Kaushal has gone through extensive training in the army under the guidance of the Indian Army's 6 Sikh Regiment in preparing for his role.[19] Kaushal in an interview with Film Companion revealed that the character would be his toughest onscreen role to date.[20] The film will not have junior artists and instead real-life army personnel and people from the Defence Force have been cast.[21]\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe Principal photography commenced on 8 August 2022.[22][23]  The film was shot over two years in 13 locations in India covering four decades of the life of Sam Manekshaw.[24] Filming took place in Mumbai, Pune, Jodhpur, Pataudi, Chandigarh, Ooty, Dehradun, Kolkata,[25] Patiala,[26] Srinagar, Pahalgam,[27] and Delhi.[28] The team wrapped on 14 March 2023.[29][30]\n\nMusic[edit]\nSam BahadurSoundtrack album by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013LoyReleased27 November 2023[31]Recorded2022StudioPurple Haze StudiosYRF StudiosGenreFeature film soundtrackLength15:08LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyShankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy chronology\n\n\nDono(2023)\n\nSam Bahadur(2023)\n\nTBA\nOfficial audioSam Bahadur - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy while the lyrics are written by Gulzar.

It's a perennial problem for biopics; how to give events the momentum of fiction when the underlying narrative is fact.\"[42]\nSubhash K. Jha of Times Now rated 3.5 stars out of 5, praised Kaushal's acting and stated \"I am afraid Vicky Kaushal, a reasonably talented actor, is not equal to the task. He tries hard to echo the original's three Bs \u2014bravery, benevolence and bravado. But mimicking the original doesn\u2019t quite amount to a comprehensive character creation.\"[43]  Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote, \"When the screenplay flattens, Vicky does the heavy lifting to keep the mission on course and after a point, the screenplay does become a series of snapshots of his long list of accomplishments set to a rousing background score, but Sam Bahadur has enough firepower to keep us invested.\"[44] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave a rating 2.5/5 and wrote \"It's hard to play a character so closely without becoming a caricature, but Kaushal becomes Sam Bahadur.\"[45] A critic from Bollywood Hungama awarded the film 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Sam Bahadur is a well-intentioned biopic and showcases Vicky Kaushal like never before. But it suffers due to the docudrama treatment.\"[46] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote \"It would be easy to describe Sam Bahadur as a Vicky Kaushal show because it is who dominates every major scene in the film, but Meghna Gulzar balances between ambition and restraint, neither the spirited central performance nor its emotional payoff would have been quite as remarkable.\"[47] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote, \"Nothing that the movie tells isn't already available in the public domain.\"[48] Tushar Joshi of India Today gave the movie 2.5 stars out of 5 and stated \"Production and set design, costumes and make-up department score big too. One wishes the direction and writing was on the same page as its technical counterpart.\"[49] Anusha Sundar of The New Indian Express opined \"Sam Bahadur would have definitely sounded good on paper. Honestly, it does feel the makers were going for a simplistic approach to tell the story of a man whose uniform is adorned with the highest honours. But somewhere, the film loses its charm and settles for mediocre storytelling for a glorious tale.\"[50] Business Today critic Anwesha Madhukalya stated \"The no-nonsense army chief, speaks out when and as he pleases, but is never cruel or ruthless to his juniors. That\u2019s where the magic of Gulzar and co\u2019s writing lies.\"[51]\nWriting a review Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain (also for Rediff.com) praised Meghna Gulzar's effort and stated \"You have to grant it to Meghna's research team and those sourcing military hardware for the film.\"[52]\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote \"Gulzar\u2019s screenplay, written with Bhavani Iyer and Shantanu Srivastava, has a little bit of everything and nothing about any one thing in particular.\"[53] Shomini Sen of WION wrote in her review \"Unfortunately, Sam Bahadur falters ever so often. This, despite the fact that Kaushal looms large on screen with his exceptional performance.\"[54]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe film was released alongside Animal on 1 December 2023. On its first day, the film collected \u20b96.25 crore, the second day \u20b99 crore and the third day \u20b910.30 crore.
