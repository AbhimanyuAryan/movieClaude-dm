The film stars Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, Radhika Madan and Seema Biswas. It is a remake of Sudha's directorial Soorarai Pottru (2020), which itself is an adaptation of G. R. Gopinath's memoir Simply Fly: A Deccan Odyssey. The film follows a man who sets out to make the common men fly, while several enemies try to get in the way.\nThe film was officially announced in July 2021 under the tentative title Project 1, as it was the maiden venture of 2D Entertainment in Hindi, and the official title was announced in February 2024. Principal photography commenced in April 2022. It is currently being predominantly shot in Mumbai in several legs. The film has music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar.\nSarfira is scheduled to release on 12 July 2024 in theatres.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nAkshay Kumar\nRadhika Madan\nParesh Rawal\nSeema Biswas\nSuriya in a cameo appearance[1]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nOn 12 July 2021, Jyothika and Suriya, headers of 2D Entertainment, stated that their production venture Soorarai Pottru (2020), was to be remade in Hindi. Furthermore, they stated that the director of the original film, Sudha Kongara, would direct the remake and they would collaborate with Vikram Malhotra, header of Abundantia Entertainment, to fund it.[2] Reportedly, one of the actors Ajay Devgn, John Abraham, Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan were considered to play the role that Suriya played in the original. The actor was reported to be finalised going by their availability.[3] In August, the co-producer of the original film, Sikhya Entertainment, had approached Madras High Court; as initially the production house was to be co-producing the remake along with 2D Entertainment, however, the latter house sold the rights to Abundantia Entertainment, without the former houses' consent.[4] By early September, the case was closed, with Sikhya Entertainment not involved in the production side.[5]  Akshay Kumar was announced on 25 April 2022 to play the role of Suriya. A muhurat puja was held the same day in Mumbai with the presence of the film's cast and crew.[6] Radhika Madan was cast, pairing opposite Kumar.[7] The official title Sarfira was announced on 13 February 2024, along with the release date of 12 July 2024.[8]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began with the first schedule on 25 April 2022 in Mumbai.[9] Madan completed filming her portions by 23 October.[10]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe music and background score is composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, in his second collaboration with Sudha after Soorarai Pottru; and maiden with Akshay Kumar. Prakash tweeted on 29 April 2022 that he had completed the first song of the soundtrack.[11]\n\nRelease[edit]\nSarfira is scheduled to release on 12 July 2024 in theatres.[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Suriya to play a cameo role in the Hindi remake of 'Soorarai Pottru'\".
