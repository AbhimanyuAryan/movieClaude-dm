Her father, Bishaw, decides to use Shakuntala's talent and have her do \"math shows,\" where she would entertain people with her problem solving prowess. Shakuntala continues to do math shows and earn for the family as she grows up, but blames her father for not letting her live a normal childhood. She also blames her mother for not standing up to him, especially in the wake of her sister's death. In 1954, she leaves for London after a violent altercation with her boyfriend, Dhiraj, after she learns that he had been pretending to love her even though he had a marriage fixed and even the invites printed out.\nIn London, Shakuntala lives with Tarabai in her home with three other Indian men but struggles to find opportunities for her shows. However, she eventually manages to impress Javier, a Spanish mathematician, when she shows off her skills at the Royal Mathematical Society in London. He helps improve Shakuntala's English and helps her get shows, and the pair begin a relationship as well. Shakuntala's popularity rapidly grows, and is given the nickname \"The Human Computer\" after she proves a computer wrong on a TV show. She expands her global influence by performing in other countries, and becomes a worldwide celebrity. Amidst all of this, Javier ends his relationship with Shakuntala, stating that he needs to return to Spain.\nIn 1968, Shakuntala meets Paritosh Banerjee (Jisshu Sengupta) in Mumbai, and the two quickly fall in love. The couple eventually get married and settle in Kolkata, with the aspirations of starting a family. In 1970, Shakuntala gives birth to Anupama, also known Anu, and devotes her life to being a mother. However, she realises how much she misses doing shows and decides to resume her career, leaving Anu with Paritosh. Shakuntala continues to amaze people, and even makes it into The Guinness Book of Records, but she worries about being an uncaring mother. Much to Paritosh's dismay, Shakuntala ultimately decides to take Anu with her on her travels and they soon divorce.\nWhile growing up, Anu travels around the world with her mother. As Shakuntala is constantly exploring new career avenues, Anu finds herself constantly ignored and disenchanted with her life. Even after enrolling Anu in a boarding school, Shakuntala uses every opportunity she can to have Anu accompany her. This reaches a breaking point when a teenage Anu lashes out at her mother for building her career at the expense of her childhood. In response, Shakuntala takes a break and settles with Anu in London, even supporting her business aspirations. This helps the mother and daughter become close. However, their relationship sours again when an adult Anu decides to marry Ajay, a businessman. Shakuntala informs Ajay of her expectation of him moving with them to London, despite him being settled in Bangalore. Anu accuses her mother of constantly holding her back and not letting her live her own life. Shakuntala, unwilling to let her daughter go, threatens to shut down Anu's business. Anu cuts off all contact with Shakuntala, and marries Ajay. She decides to not have children, fearing that she would not be a good mother. Despite this, Anu gives birth to a daughter, Amritha.\nAnu and Ajay receive a shock when they are informed that Shakuntala used her power of attorney to sell Anu's business properties, while giving her zero percent of the profit share. Furthermore, she passed the payment of the capital gains tax on to Anu, leaving her family in massive debt. Anu and Ajay decide to take legal action against Shakuntala, and travel to London for the proceedings. Upon their arrival, they discover that Shakuntala's actions were a stunt, done so she could force her daughter to come see her. Shakuntala gives Anu the profit received from the sale of her properties, and asks for her forgiveness. Anu forgives her mother, and the two have an emotional reunion.\n\nCast[edit]\nVidya Balan as Shakuntala Devi; Paritosh's former wife, Anupama's mother, Ajay's mother-in-law and Amrita's grandmother\nSpandan Chaturvedi as teenage Shakuntala\nAraina Nand as child Shakuntala\nJisshu Sengupta as Paritosh Banerjee; Shakuntala's former husband, Anupama's father, Ajay's father-in-law and Amritha's grandfather[8]\nSanya Malhotra as Anupama Bannerji (a.k.a. \"Anu\"); Shakuntala and Paritosh's daughter, Ajay's wife and Amritha's mother.[9]\nChahat Tewani as Anu (teenage)\nAmit Sadh as Ajay Abhay Kumar; Anupama's husband, Shakuntala and Paritosh's son-in-law and Amritha's father[10]\nPrakash Belawadi as Bishaw Mitra Mani: Shakuntala's father[11]\nNisha Aaliya as Bookshop Interviewer[11]\nSheeba Chaddha as Tarabai Banarsi, Shakuntala's landlady in London\nVidyuth Gargi as Mohan Manhas, a TV game show host\nIpshita Chakraborty Singh as Mrs. Devi, Shakuntala's mother\nJiya Shah as Sharada Devi, Shakuntala's sister\nRenuka Sharma as Mrs. Kumar, Ajay's mother\nNeil Bhoopalam as Dheeraj Rajan, Shakuntala's former boyfriend\nLuca Calvani as Javier Lewis, Shakuntala's Spanish boyfriend based in London.\n\nLan Bailey as Mediator\nAhan Nirbhan as Srinivas\nAdi Chugh as Kartar\nPhilip Roy as Shakuntala's lawyer\nJack Francis as Anupama's lawyer\nSantosh Banerjee as Gordhanbhai\nRelease[edit]\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was not released theatrically and streamed on Amazon Prime Video worldwide on 31 July 2020.[1] Vidya Balan expressed her delight on social media platforms regarding the release of the film on over-the-top media services.[12][13][14]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nShakuntala DeviSoundtrack album by Sachin\u2013JigarReleased21 July 2020[15]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength11:35LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanySachin\u2013Jigar chronology\n\n\nAngrezi Medium(2020)\n\nShakuntala Devi(2020)\n\nRoohi(2021)\nExternal audio Official Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThe film's music was composed by Sachin\u2013Jigar while lyrics written by Vayu and Priya Saraiya.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsSinger(s)Length1.\"Pass Nahi Toh Fail Nahi\"VayuSunidhi Chauhan2:312.\"Rani Hindustani\"VayuSunidhi Chauhan2:243.\"Paheli\"Priya SaraiyaShreya Ghoshal3:214.\"Jhilmil Piya\"Priya SaraiyaBenny Dayal, Monali Thakur3:19Total length:11:35\nCritical reception[edit]\nShakuntala Devi received positive reviews from critics. \nSreeparna Sengupta of Times of India gave the film three and half stars out of five and said, \"A joy to watch simply to soak in the fascinating life and times of the maths whiz \u2013 a human computer faster than an actual computer, the free-spirit, who was all that and so much more!\"[16]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated it three out of five stars, calling it \"a Vidya Balan show\".[17]\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV opined \"the numbers add up nicely with a feisty Vidya Balan\", giving the movie three out of five stars.[18]\nMike McCahill of The Guardian gave it three stars out of five and said, \"The movie finds funny ways of dramatising the process whereby one generation of women squares its frustrations with another \u2013 but it adds up to spirited, intelligent, authentically feminist entertainment.\"[19]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Shakuntala Devi release date out: Vidya Balan film to hit Amazon Prime on July 31\".
