It was released theatrically on 25 August 2023.[8] The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was a commercial success, grossing \u20b9140 crore worldwide, emerging as the eleventh-highest grossing Hindi film of 2023.[9]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nKaramveer \"Karam\" Singh is a young middle-class man living in Mathura and works as a Jagrata performer. He has a special talent of perfectly impersonating a female voice. His father Jagjit Singh is in huge debts after borrowing multiple loans and is unable to repay them. He is in a relationship with Pari Srivastava, a lawyer from a wealthy family. Pari's father Jaipal Srivastava says that he will get Pari married to Karam only if he is able to land a high paying job and buy a house of his own, within six months. In order to earn quick money, Karam disguises as a woman going by the alias \"Pooja\" and becomes a dancer at a bar owned by Sona Bhai. Pari remains unaware of this.\nKaram's best friend Smiley Singh Dhillon is in love with Sakina, the daughter of the hostile Abu Saleem. Abu says that he will get Sakina married only after his son Shah Rukh Saleem is married. Shah Rukh is in depression ever since he had a breakup with his lover six months ago. Abu says that he will give a reward of Rs.10 lakhs to the person who manages to get Shah Rukh out of depression. Smiley requests Karam to pose as \"Pooja\" and pretend to be a psychiatrist for treating Shah Rukh.\nKaram as \"Pooja\" manages to cheer Shah Rukh up. Abu is overjoyed and says that he wants \"Pooja\" to be Shah Rukh's bride and\u00a0Yusuf Ali Salim Khan, Shah Rukh's wheelchair-bound grandfather says that he will pay \"Pooja\" Rs. 50 lakhs for getting married to Shah Rukh. Karam, seeing the opportunity of making a lot of money, decides to go ahead with the wedding, and then abscond later. On the first night after the wedding, Yusuf sees \"Pooja\" urinating like a man and dies of shock.\nAbu says that as per their family tradition, when someone from the family dies, no family member can get married for the next six months, meaning Smiley cannot get married to Sakina. Moreover, before dying Yusuf had written a message on the wall which read - \"Daughter-in-law boy\". Everyone\u00a0 assumes that he wanted \"Pooja\" to give birth to a baby boy as a last wish, putting the pressure on \"Pooja\" to get pregnant, which would practically be impossible.\nAs \"Pooja\" cannot go to the bar to dance regularly anymore, Sona Bhai keeps calling her and asking her to come back to work. He also says that he wants to marry her, so that post his divorce, his children do not feel the absence of a mother. Abu's adopted son Shaukya is also attracted to \"Pooja\" and keeps flirting with her and trying to impress her. Meanwhile, Abu misunderstands that Karam is actually \"Pooja\"'s brother. Abu's sister Jumani is attracted to Karam and comes to Jagjit to propose her marriage with Karam. Jagjit, who is attracted to her, misunderstands that she is talking about her marriage with himself. He later realises the truth when he goes on to exchange engagement rings with Jumani, and she clears his confusion.\nOne night, while in the bedroom with Shah Rukh,\u00a0 \"Pooja\"'s wig comes off revealing Karam's facade. Shah Rukh is shocked and reveals that he is actually gay and Abu forcefully had him breakup with his boyfriend so that he can get married to a girl instead. Shah Rukh keeps Karam's facade a secret from his family. Sometime later, Jumani asks Karam out on a date and proposes to him with a rose. Pari who happens to be there coincidentally, misunderstands that Karam is cheating on her with Jumani and breaks up with him.\nAs \"Pooja\" cannot get pregnant, Abu takes her to Baby Baba, a spiritual guru who can miraculously get women to become pregnant. He asks \"Pooja\" and Shah Rukh to take a dip in the holy Yamuna river. While doing so, \"Pooja\" escapes, making everyone believe that she has died by drowning and a memorial service is held for her.\nKaram learns that Pari is getting married to another man and rushes to the wedding ceremony. He performs a dance as \"Pooja\", making Pari realise the truth. Karam talks about all the hardships he faced out of his love for Pari and to get married to her. Everyone else also arrives there and all the confusion is cleared. Karam confronts Jaipal about his classist mentality and he realises his mistake and gets Karam and Pari married in a grand ceremony.\n\nCast[edit]\nAyushmann Khurrana as Pooja / Karamveer \"Karam\" Singh, Jagjit's son\nAnanya Panday as Pari Srivastava, Karam's love interest[10]\nParesh Rawal as Mohammed Abu Saleem, Shah Rukh's father\nAnnu Kapoor as Jagjit Singh, Karam's father\nVijay Raaz as Saajan Tiwari alias Sona Bhai\nRajpal Yadav as Mohammed Shoukiya, Abu's step-son\nAsrani as Yusuf Ali Salim Khan, Abu's father\nManoj Joshi as Jaipal Srivastava, Pari's father\nSeema Pahwa as Jumani, Abu's sister\nManjot Singh as Smiley Singh Dhillon\nAbhishek Bannerjee as Mohammed Shahrukh Saleem, Abu's son\nSudesh Lehri as Baby Baba\nAnusha Mishra as Sakina\nAakarsh Dutt Chaturvedi as Naveen Srivastav Paris's Brother\nRanjan Raj as Tiger Pandey\nDolly Singh as Tiger Pandey's sister\nRitu Singh as Tiger Pandey's mother\nRaj Sharma as Kukki Dhillon\nRajat Poddar as Doctor\nJaved Haider as Inspector Gopal Das\nRaj Qushal as Ali\nRaj Bhansali as Quli\nSapna Sand as Principal\nMusic[edit]\nDream Girl 2Soundtrack album by Meet Bros, Tanishk Bagchi, ArkoReleased25 August 2023Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength19:25LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioDream Girl 2 - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Meet Bros, Tanishk Bagchi and Arko while background score is composed by Hitesh Sonik.
