He has a crush on a girl in his school, called Aishwarya. She is the daughter of a famous businessman, Maalpani, who invites Ved for her birthday party. Unbeknownst to him, her father has a different plan. He has invited Ved's father, who's a Hindu priest, to sing a bhajan at Aishwarya's birthday puja.\nFrom that day on, Ved becomes a famous religious singer as \"Bhajan Kumar\". He is a bachelor, and because of his religious personality, all the girls look at him as a priest, and ask him for blessings. He follows a girl called Jasmeet into the area of the local Muslim community. He finds out that Jasmeet is a singer. He unknowingly scares off their musician Abdul, Jasmeet forces them to perform at singing event, where Ved takes the stage. Ved goes on a coffee date with Jasmeet. There is a big wedding (Aishwarya's) which is coming as competition between Siyaram Tripathi (Father of Ved) and Mishra to get the priest contract. While Tripathi goes to religious trip for 2 weeks, a person delivers a letter at home. The letter says that Ved is not Tripathi's son, and that he is a Muslim. Ved's eyes has filled with pitch-black kohl and also Ved has dressed up as a Muslim. Ved has to put on his green attire Kurta Pyjama, his Taqiyah cap and his kohl-lined eyes. While Ved's uncle tries to protect their family's respect, Mishra tries to spoil Ved's and his family's image. Before the climax, there is a story where Siyaram Tripathi discloses the truth about Ved's identity and the whole family stands together to support Ved.\nDuring the climax scene, Ved has a blood test done and also Ved's blood colour was red. But he also taught everyone \"Democracy\" and \"Secular\" and also expose Mishra and his son TD (Tulsidas). At the end, Ved is proud of his \"The Great Indian Family\".\n\nCast[edit]\nVicky Kaushal as Ved Vyas Tripathi (Bhajan Kumar & Billu)\nManushi Chhillar as Jasmeet Kaur Randhawa\nManoj Pahwa as Balakram Tripathi\nKumud Mishra as Pandit Siyaram Tripathi\nYashpal Sharma as Pandit Jagannath Mishra\nSadiya Siddiqui as Hema Tripathi\nAlka Amin as Sushila Kumari\nSrishti Dixit as Gunja Tripathi\nBharti Perwani as Rampyari Singh Chauhan\nBhuvan Arora as Bhaata Mishra\nAasif Khan as Tulsidas \"TD\" Mishra\nAshutosh Ujjwal as Sarveshwar Malpani\nMoumita Pal as Sumitra Tripathi\nParitosh Sand as Mr. Malpani\nMeena Malhotra as Mrs. Malpani\nFahad Samar as Mr. Ahuja\nAparna Ghoshal as Mrs. Ahuja\nRudraksh Thakur as Neeraj\nHitesh Arora as Abdul\nRenuka Sharma as Amma\nVedant Sinha as Kid VV (Ved Vyas Tripathi)\nAreebah Fatima as Kid Gunja Tripathi\nJiya Amin as Kid Aishwarya Malpani\nTarun Kumar as Maulvi\nDevang Tanna as Pintu Shukla\nKeval Arora as Dr. Irani\nGhanshyam Garg as Raghubir Yadav\nSumit Singh Bhadoriya as Amit Ahuja\nSaloni Khanna as Aishwarya Malpani\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced on 20 November 2020.[11] Production wrapped on 25 February 2021.[12]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe Great Indian FamilySoundtrack album by PritamReleased15 September 2023[13]Recorded2021-22StudioYash Raj StudioGenreFeature film soundtrackLength15:19LanguageHindiLabelYRF MusicPritam chronology\n\n\nRocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani(2023)\n\nThe Great Indian Family(2023)\n\nTiger 3(2023)\nOfficial audioThe Great Indian Family - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Pritam.
