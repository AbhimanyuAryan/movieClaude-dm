In retrospect, one can't help but wish that the filmmakers had embraced the more gritty and brutal elements, which could have elevated the film to a higher level of authenticity and resonance\".[6]\nZinia Bandyopadhyay of The Free Press Journal rated this film 3+1\u20442 out of 5 stars and said \"All in all no one will miss this film, a must watch film. \u2018UT 69\u201d will set a unique example in the minds of Human Right Authorities and all concerned within its premise. And they\u00a0 will surely work towards bringing reformations in our jails and treat the accused not like animals but like human beings\".[7]\nSimran Singh of DNA India rated this film three out of five stars and said \"UT69 will surprise you as it gives a closer look at the life of jail inmates, and you might feel privileged to have basic amenities and live a free life.\"[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Desk, DH Web. \"'UT69' trailer: Raj Kundra's jail chronicles come alive in his debut\".
