Babloo has met with a few girls hoping to find his bride, but none of the girls were right. Finally Babloo met Avantika, who had 5 boyfriends before meeting Babloo. Avantika requests Babloo to reject the proposal and Babloo rejects her for marriage. After one month at a cousin's wedding, Babloo met Swati, who he ends up falling in love with, eventually proposing. On their suhaag raat (First wedding night), Swati runs away after mixing sleeping pill in Babloo's drink and  leaving Babloo a letter. Babloo sees an ad on newspaper about the shows of Swati, and traveled to Mumbai to find her and bring her home back. While in Mumbai, Babloo runs into Avantika, where he tells Avantika his feelings about Swati and agrees to help him win her back. While speaking with Avantika, Babloo realizes she is a good person regardless of her past engagements, leaving Babloo to choose between two women.[5]\n\nCast[edit]\nSharman Joshi as Babloo[6]\nPooja Chopra as Avantika\nTejashri Pradhan as Swati[7]\nRajesh Sharma as Babloo's Father\nLeena Prabhu as Babloo's Mother\nNeeraj Khetarpal as  Babloo's Chacha\nSumit Gulati as Babloo's Friend\nBeena Bhat as Babloo's Sister\nRaju Kher as Prabhat\nCharu Rohatgi as Prabhat Wife\nSweety Walia as Sharman Bua\nManoj Joshi as Phopa\nAkash Dhabade as Friend\nDolly Chawla as Bua's Daughter\nAsrani as Broker\nPuneet Vashist as Village Boy\nDeepali Sharma as Ankh Marne wali Girl\nAshok Awasthi as Ankh Marne wali girl's father\nMousumi Dutta as Gymnastic Girl\nDeepali Singh as Feet Attack Girl\nMukesh Padhya as Feet Attack girl's father\nNidhi Vikram as Bhabhi\nSoundtrack[edit]\nBabloo BachelorSoundtrack album by Jeet Gannguli & Indradip DasguptaReleased4 March 2020[8]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength31:41LabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioBabloo Bachelor - Full Album on YouTubeSingles from  Babloo Bachelor \n\"Aye Meri Zindagi\"Released: 4 March 2020\n\"Kasam\"Released: 4 March 2020\n\"Jealous\"Released: 12 March 2020\n\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Jeet Gannguli and Indradip Dasgupta.
