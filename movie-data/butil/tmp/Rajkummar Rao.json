The film and Rao's performance met with widespread critical acclaim. Namrata Joshi wrote: \"Rao is a hoot and brings the house down with his chameleon turn and comic timing\u00a0\u2013 simpering simpleton one minute, full of swagger the next; a role that could have become a caricature in the hands of a lesser actor.\"[63] The film was a commercial success and Rao won his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film.[64][65]\nAmit V. Masurkar's black comedy Newton was Rao's next film. In it, he plays the role of an upright government clerk sent on election duty to a Naxal-controlled town.

To prepare for the role, Rao watched several videos, documentaries and hate speeches by Sheikh to \"gather a lot of hatred and anger\" inside himself.[76] He said he was \"disturbed\" while shooting the film because of the character he was portraying and called it \"easily the toughest character\" he has played until then.[76][77] The film had its world premier at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in India on 4\u00a0May 2018.[78] The film and Rao's performance met with critical acclaim, with Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV calling it a \"pitch-perfect performance\".[79]\nHe starred next in the musical comedy Fanney Khan (2018) with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anil Kapoor.

Co-starring Priyanka Chopra and Adarsh Gourav, the film started streaming on Netflix on 22 January and met with positive critical reception.[98] David Rooney from The Hollywood Reporter noted that Rao \"deftly balances a Western-schooled urge to tell himself he's a fair-minded man with the unmistakable air of privileged entitlement.\"[99] His subsequent release was the horror-comedy Roohi co-starring Janhvi Kapoor. The second instalment in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy universe, the first being Stree, the film met with mixed critical feedback and was a box office failure.[100]\nRao starred with Bhumi Pednekar in Badhaai Do, a spiritual sequel to the 2018 comedy-drama Badhaai Ho.[101] He won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance.[102]\nHe has wrapped up filming for the Hindi remake of the 2020 Telugu thriller HIT: The First Case.[103][104] Rao reunited with Kriti Sanon in the comedy drama film Hum Do Hamare Do (2021).[105]\n\nPublic image\nForbes India featured Rao in their 30 Under 30 list of 2014.[106] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) listed him as India's Hottest Vegetarian Celebrity in 2017.[107] The same year, he appeared on Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list and GQ magazine's list of 50 Most Influential Young Indians.[108][109] He has served as the brand ambassador for Actimaxx, Seventh Street and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India's eat right movement.[110][111][112]\nRao donated an undisclosed amount of money to the PM CARES Fund, the Maharashtra Chief Minister's Relief Fund and Zomato's Feeding India to help feed families in need because of the COVID-19 pandemic in India.[113]\n\nFilmography\nMain article: Rajkummar Rao filmography\nAwards and nominations\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Rajkummar Rao\nReferences\n\n\n^ Kukreja, Monica (31 August 2017). \"Happy birthday Rajkummar Rao: Actor recalls best gift; an army uniform his mom got him\".
