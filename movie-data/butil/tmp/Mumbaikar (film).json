A critic from The Times of India wrote that \"'Mumbaikar' raises high expectations, but unfortunately, it only partially fulfills its promise. However, Vijay Sethupathi's performance manages to redeem the film to some extent, injecting moments of brilliance into the narrative\".[11] A critic from The Hindu wrote that \"The film marks his Hindi debut, but Vijay Sethupathi is a little too spectacular for the size of the film. As for Sivan, Mumbaikar might well count as yet another directorial venture that doesn\u2019t match his stature as a cinematographer\".[12] Saibal Chatterjee a critic from NDTV wrote that \"The Writing Does Not Fully Align With Vijay Sethupathi's Skills\".[13] Shubham Kulkarni of Koimoi rated the film 2/5 and said \"For a movie titled Mumbaikar, the biggest question is, where is Mumbai? With no nod to the city or its vibe, this is an unnecessary dull remake. Feel sorry for Vijay Sethupathi.\"[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Vijay Sethupathi teams up with Santosh Sivan for Mumbaikar, Karan Johar and Rajamouli share poster\".
