The film was produced by Shobha Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Guneet Monga and Achin Jain under the banners Balaji Motion Pictures and Sikhya Entertainment.[5] The film features Sanya Malhotra, Ashutosh Rana, Shruti Sharma and Raghubir Yadav in lead roles.[6][7][8]\nThe film follows a young widow as she learns how to face the family and was released on 26 March 2021 on Netflix.[3]\nAt the 2021 Filmfare OTT Awards, Pagglait received 3 nominations, including Best Actress in a Web Original Film (Malhotra) and Best Supporting Actress in a Web Original Film (Sayani Gupta), and won Best Supporting Actress in a Web Original Film (Rana).\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nA young widow, Sandhya, and her in-laws are dealing with the loss of her husband, Astik, who died after just five months of marriage. Astik's parents, Usha and Shivendra, are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of their eldest son, on whom they were financially dependent. The family suffers even more when their relatives come to the house and create a mess. Amidst a house full of grieving relatives, Sandhya yawns through the social media condolence posts and \"copy-paste\" comments for Astik. Her attitude leaves some puzzled and others miffed. A relative, Ghanashyam, suggests she is suffering from PTSD. When Sandhya's best friend Nazia comes to support her, Sandhya confesses to her that she does not feel anything for the loss of her husband. To get away from the mourning family, she sneaks away with Nazia for a feast of 'golgappe', even as Astik's younger brother Alok performs the necessary funeral rituals at the river.\nSandhya and Astik were never really a close couple in the few months they shared. While looking for Astik's documents for the bank claim, Sandhya finds a photo of a girl in the closet. Sandhya feels anger towards her dead husband thinking he was cheating on her. When Astik's colleagues visit her to offer condolences, she finds the girl from the photo, Aakanksha. Sandhya confronts her in private about her affair. Aakanksha states that she and Astik were deeply in love since college and they both worked in the same company. But he never cheated on his wife, and that they were together until Astik married Sandhya. They could not get married as her parents did not agree to their union. Sandhya finds this hard to believe. The two, however, grow close as she tries to learn more about Astik from Aakanksha.\nMeanwhile, members of the family react strongly when it is revealed that Astik had signed an insurance policy for INR 50 lakhs, of which Sandhya is the sole nominee. Shivendra's brothers Tarun, Ghanshyam, and Pappu convince him to use the insurance money for repaying his own bank loans, and he unwillingly tries to replace Sandhya with himself and Usha as nominees. Shivendra and Usha, still grieving the loss of their son, try to come to terms with the family's proposal that Sandhya should be married off to Astik's paternal cousin, Tarun's son Aditya, who is unemployed and failing to manage money for his hotel business.\nSandhya asks Aditya why he wants to marry her. He says he is in love with her, which touches her heart and she accepts the proposal. This angers her parents and Alok, who is also in love with her. On the 13th day of Astik's funeral, Aditya leaves hastily. His parents tell everyone that Sandhya told him that she was pregnant with Astik's child. It is revealed by Aditya's sister, Aditi, that Sandhya lied about her pregnancy to test Aditya's love for her. Sandhya goes missing from the house after the funeral.\nSandhya, meanwhile, is ready to begin a new life with a new job in a new city. Even after being a topper in her M.A. class, her family never let her settle for a job. She shares how since childhood, the main focus of her parents was to marry her off, without any concern for her independence. Seeing Aakanksha working a job, she becomes motivated to work, and become financially independent. She realises that if she had stayed back, she could never live her own life; because in a patriarchal society, other people make decisions for women.\nEventually, in three separate letters to Usha, her mother, Alka, and Alok, Sandhya bids goodbye to her in-laws. Shivendra finds a cheque for the full insurance money, which Sandhya left for him as she believed he'd need it more than her. She also promises to support her in-laws as her husband did.\nSandhya meets with Aakanksha one last time and apologises for earlier her outburst, and gives her the photograph Astik had kept in his book. In the end, she travels on a bus, ready to face life afresh.\n\nCast[edit]\nSanya Malhotra as Sandhya Giri (n\u00e9e Pandey), Astik's widow\nAshutosh Rana as Shivendra Giri, Astik's father\nSheeba Chaddha as Usha Giri, Astik's mother\nChetan Sharma as Alok Giri, Astik's younger brother\nNatasha Rastogi as Alka Pandey, Sandhya's mother\nBhupesh Pandya as Girish Pandey, Sandhya's father\nSayani Gupta as Aakansha Roy, Astik's colleague and ex-girlfriend\nShruti Sharma as Nazia Zaidi, Sandhya's friend\nRaghubir Yadav as Pappu Giri, referred to as Tayyaji; Shivendra's elder brother\nAasif Khan as Parchun, a neighbour of the Giris\nYamini Singh as Janaki Giri, Shivendra's sister\nJameel Khan as Ghanshyam, Janaki's husband, who is a banker\nRajesh Tailang as Tarun Giri, Shivendra's younger brother\nAnanya Khare as Rashmi Giri, Tarun's wife\nMeghna Malik as Tulika, Shivendra's sister-in-law\nTawhid Rike Zaman as Sandhya's friend\nNakul Roshan Sahdev as Aditya Giri, Tarun's son\nSharib Hashmi as B.K.

Certain audiences noted that the film had similarities with Seema Pahwa's directorial debut Ramprasad Ki Tehrvi. Speaking about the film, Pahwa stated that this was due to both films having a similar setting. She went on to commend the actors' performances, especially Malhotra's, but objected to the fact that the film portrayed humour in a family at a time when they had just lost a young member.[17][18][19][20]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of 13 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.80/10.[21]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nAward[a]\n\nYear[b]\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient(s)\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nAsian Academy Creative Awards\n\n3 December 2021\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nUmesh Bist\n\nWon\n\n[22]\n\n\nBest Sound\n\nPagglait\n\nWon\n\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\n9 December 2021\n\nBest Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nSanya Malhotra\n\nNominated\n\n[23][24]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nAshutosh Rana\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nSayani Gupta\n\nNominated\n\n\nFOI Online Awards\n\n15 January 2022\n\nBest Feature Film\n\nPagglait\n\nNominated\n\n[25]\n\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nUmesh Bist\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Dialogues\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\nSanya Malhotra\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nAshutosh Rana\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n\nSheeba Chaddha\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Performance by an Ensemble Cast\n\nCast of Pagglait\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Music Direction \u2013 Songs\n\nArijit Singh\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Original Song\n\n\u201cPhire Faqeera\u201d \u2013 Arijit Singh, Neelesh Misra, Raja Kumari & Amrita Singh\n\nWon\n\n\n\u201cThode Kam Ajnabi\u201d \u2013 Arijit Singh, Neelesh Misra & Himani Kapoor\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Playback Singer \u2013 Female\n\nHimani Kapoor \u2013 \u201cThode Kam Ajnabi\u201d\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Lyricist\n\nNeelesh Misra \u2013 \u201cPhire Faqeera\u201d\n\nWon\n\n\nNeelesh Misra \u2013 \u201cThode Kam Ajnabi\u201d\n\nNominated\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Awards, festivals and organisations are in alphabetical order.\n\n^ Date is linked to the article about the awards held that year, wherever possible.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Suri, Rishabh (12 March 2021). \"Arijit Singh all set to turn music composer with Pagglait\".
