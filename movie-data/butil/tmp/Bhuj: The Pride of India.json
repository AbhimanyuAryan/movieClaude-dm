A small group of Indian Army soldiers defend Bhuj from being overrun, while 300 local women, led by the base's commander Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik, reconstruct the airbase under enemy fire.\nThe film starts with the Pakistani Prime Minister discussing about conquering the Indian territories. The wife of a Pakistani army officer is shown to be an Indian spy, who came to take the revenge of her brother's murder, who caught and was brutally killed. But she was also caught and was given same death as her brother.\n\nCast[edit]\nAjay Devgn as Squadron Leader Vijay Srinivas Karnik, IAF; Usha's husband\nSanjay Dutt as Ranchordas Pagi, Indian Army Scout and R&AW agent\nSonakshi Sinha as Sunderben Jetha Madharparya\nNora Fatehi as R&AW spy Heena Rehman\nSharad Kelkar as Lt.

On 29 June 2020, the streaming service Disney+ Hotstar conducted a virtual press conference where Devgn announced that the film will release through the streaming platform,[39][40] exclusively as part of the Disney+ Hotstar Multiplex initiative which was a result of theatres being shut down due to the pandemic restrictions.[41][42][43] The digital rights of the film were sold at an amount of \u20b9112 crores.[44]\nBhuj: The Pride of India was delayed extensively due to pending production works and also the streaming platform Disney+ Hotstar prioritised on the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League, held during September and November 2020.[45][46] In July 2021,[47] it was announced that the film would be premiered on the occasion of Independence Day weekend (13 August 2021).[1][48][49]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from the film critics, who criticized the film for its writing, pace and unrealistic situations but praised the film for its visuals and the performances of the ensemble cast.[10][11] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film 1 star out of 5 and wrote, \"Ajay Devgn in slow motion does little for what is anyway a godawfully  [sic] dull war saga\". She criticized the writing of the script by saying \"Terrible writing, sleep-inducing direction and some pretty bad acting \u2013 there\u2019s so much that\u2019s wrong with Bhuj: The Pride of India, that an in-depth analysis of its politics makes no sense.\" She concluded \"Bhuj: The Pride of India clearly does not want to be like either of these two films [referring to Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl and Shershaah], but it fails miserably even in its attempt to be [a] hormonally-charged, flag-waving, chest-thumping, clich\u00e9d nationalist entertainment. Yawn.\"[50]\nSaibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film at 1.5 stars and criticized the acting and writing.  He summarised the film. \"busy gathering the scattered splinters of its insipid ideas made infinitely worse by resolutely ham-fisted treatment.\"[51] Anupama Chopra of Film Companion wrote, \"The characters are stick figures who repeatedly proclaim their love for the motherland.\"[52]\nShubra Gupta of The Indian Express too gave the film 1 star out of 5 opening, \"High on slogan shouting, Ajay Devgn film almost hides its real heroes\", \"Toplined by a swaggering Ajay Devgn, the film is so heavy on jingoistic jingle jangles and slogan-shouting that it almost succeeds in hiding the 300 women who pulled off an incredible feat.\"[53] Soumya Srivastava of Hindustan Times wrote, \"Ajay Devgn's chest-thumping, gunpowder-snorting film fights Radhe for worst of the year crown.\"[54]\nTaran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and called it \"Thrilling\" noting, \"Bhuj is a Big Screen, mass-appealing spectacle. Scale, Star power and Stunning visuals leave you mesmerized.\" He praised Nora Fatehi's performance and concluded that Bhuj would've worked very well if it had been released in cinemas.[55]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"SCOOP: Ajay Devgn's Bhuj gearing up for an Independence Day premiere on Disney+ Hotstar\".
