His village has been suffering from famine and crop failure, exacerbated by wildlife encroachment. During an unsuccessful visit to a government office to seek poverty aid, he glances upon a poster that stated that the kin of victims of fatal tiger encounters in areas bordering tiger reserves would be entitled to a \u20b910,00,000 compensation from the Govt. of India. In a desperate attempt to alleviate the conditions of his village, Gangaram plots to sacrifice himself in a tiger attack. During his search for a tiger, his path crosses with that of a poacher (Jim Ahmed) with whom he forms an unconventional partnership. The story then follows his journey, highlighting social issues faced by the lesser fortunate.\nGangaram unites with the poacher and both go looking for a tiger. After many days they find a tiger. Gangaram walks toward the tiger and the poacher is ready to shoot it. But the tiger is full and walks away. Forest officers follow them and shoot the poacher and take Gangaram into custody. Gangaram's story becomes famous all over India. He is pardoned from the court.\nIn the final scene, Gangaram comes back to the jungle in 4 wheelers with officers who want to promote tourism. Gangaram wants to take a leak and he goes to the jungle alone and is attacked by a tiger.\n\nCast[edit]\nPankaj Tripathi as Gangaram \"Gangu\"[6]\nSayani Gupta as Lajwanti \"Lajjo\"\nNeeraj Kabi as Jim Ahmed\nSohag Sen as Gangaram's mother\nRk Rakesh Boro as Ritvi\nAkshay Kapoor as DFO\nSougata Ghosh\nSoundtrack[edit]\nThe music rights of the film are owned by T Series.
