The conversation doesn't benefit any of the communities the movie so proudly portrays, and the images fall short of enlivening the restrained.[9] Dhaval Roy of The Times of India gave 2 stars out of 5 and writes in his review that although Safed's idea seems sound on paper, it is not well executed. A thoughtful idea becomes more sensational than delicate, and the over-dramatization diminishes its effect.[10] Toshiro Agarwal of Times Now criticizes the film and said In his directing debut, Sandeep Singh explores marginalized lives via Kaali's unanticipated romance with Chaandi. The film receives a meager 1.5 stars because of its forced speech and unexpressed emotions, despite its decent intentions.[11] A reviewer from OTT Play writes For those who enjoy seeing experimental films, \"Safed\" is a good choice. However, it is still true that modern moviegoers would rather see a heroine dressed in a contemporary chiffon sari than a \"safed\" saree (if you know what we mean!).[12] Writing for Rediff, Mayur Sanap gave one star and opined \"Safed\u00a0is a lame attempt at social commentary, with terribly dull and thoughtless direction\".[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Safed\".
