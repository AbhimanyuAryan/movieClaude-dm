The film was premiered via ZEE5 on 5 September 2020 and generally opened to positive reviews from critics.[4][5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe story revolves around a 13 year old Guddu who works as a helper at a tea stall. His father, an ex musician is a penniless alcoholic, and his mother a singer has abandoned the family. Therefore, he has to take the responsibility of his family at a tender age. Music is his passion, he loves to observe, listen and create new tunes. On his daily chai delivery visits, he watches a wedding band practice keenly, completely losing the sense of time. He has a desire to join the band one day. Along with Guddu, the film also tells the tale of other street children who work near Guddu\u2019s tea stall. One day while wandering in the city, they come across a carnival where they see an orchestra performing for money which inspires them to form their own band. Atkan Chatkan shows the dreams of millions of young children who do not have the means but only a burning passion that needs careful nurturing to grow and succeed in life.[6]\n\nCast[edit]\nLydian Nadhaswaram as Guddu\nAmitriyaan as Guddu's Father\nSpruha Joshi as Guddu's Mother\nYash Rane as Madhav\nSachin Chaudhary as Chuttan\nTamanna Dipak as Meethi\nAyesha Vindhara as Lata\nSaurabh V Pandey\nTanmay Chaturvedi as Bully Boy\nProduction[edit]\nThe son of music director Varshan Sathish, Lydian Nadhaswaram who rose to prominence as a child prodigy pianist after winning the reality talent show The World's Best was roped into play the main lead in the film.

What makes this film stand out despite its poverty template are the powerful performances of the child actors and Sivamani\u2019s spectacular music\" [9] Pradeep Kumar of The Hindu wrote \"Lydian Nadhaswaram makes a solid debut and \u2018Drums\u2019 Sivamani\u2019s soul-lifting tunes are worth checking out, but \u2018Atkan Chatkan\u2019 falls flat due to the lack of drama in its storyline\" [10] Ektaa malik of The Indian Express wrote \"The two-hour-fifteen minute film is the directorial debut of Shiv Hare, and while the earnestness of the attempt was palpable in the trailer, the full-length feature adds nothing more to it\" [11] Vibha Maru of India Today had just few positives to mention about the film stating \"The film's only highlight is when we see Lydian beat the tunes of Sivamani's music, pouring some excitement into the film. Other child actors like Sachin Choudhary and Yash Rane also give notable performances\"[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Atkan Chatkan movie review: Stuck in a time warp\".
