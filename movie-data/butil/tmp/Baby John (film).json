However, it was undisclosed whether Atlee, the director of the original film, would direct the venture or give the role to someone else.[3] Reportedly, the director had met the actor in Mumbai during 2019 to discuss the possibilities of a possible collaboration in the near future.[4][5] In March 2022, the production for the project was reported to begin soon as Dhawan had reportedly completed his consisting commitments. According to reports, Atlee and Dhawan met again to finalise the project.[6] On 19 March, the collaboration of both was publicly announced.[7] Tentatively titled as VD18, instead of directing it, Atlee was revealed to produce the project under his house A for Apple Productions, along with Murad Khetani's Cine1 Studios. Kalees, who is a former assistant of Atlee and the director of the 2019 techno-thriller film Kee, was hired to direct the project.[8][9] The official title Baby John was announced on 5 February 2024.[10]\n\nCasting[edit]\nJanhvi Kapoor was reported to play the lead actress role, pairing opposite Varun for the second time after Bawaal (2023).[11][12] However, Keerthy Suresh was reported to have replaced the former (in her first Hindi film). She would reportedly receive a remuneration of \u20b93 crore (US$380,000) and reprise Samantha's role in the original film.[13][14] The latter was finalised for the role in July 2023.[15][16] Wamiqa Gabbi was cast to reprise the role of Amy Jackson.[17][18] Jackie Shroff was cast to play the main antagonist, reprising the role of late Mahendran.
