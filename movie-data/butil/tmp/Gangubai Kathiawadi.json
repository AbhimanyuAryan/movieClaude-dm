The film stars Alia Bhatt in the title role, alongside Shantanu Maheshwari, Vijay Raaz, Indira Tiwari, Seema Pahwa, Jim Sarbh and Ajay Devgn.\nThe film is about Gangubai Kothewali, whose life was documented in the book Mafia Queens of Mumbai written by S. Hussain Zaidi. The film depicts the rise of a simple girl from Kathiawad who had no choice but to embrace the ways of destiny and swing it in her favour.[5][6][7][8] Gangubai Kathiawadi premiered at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on 16 February 2022, and was released in theatres on 25 February 2022.\nGangubai Kathiawadi received widespread critical acclaim for its themes, direction, production value and Bhatt's performance. In its theatrical run, the film grossed \u20b9153.69 crore (US$19\u00a0million) at the domestic box office and \u20b9209.77 crore (US$26\u00a0million) globally emerging as a major commercial success.[9] Numerous publications listed Gangubai Kathiawadi and Bhatt's performance in the film on various year-end best films and performances lists of 2022.[10][11]\nThe film has received various accolades. At the 69th National Film Awards, Gangubai Kathiawadi won 5 awards, including Best Actress (Bhatt) and Best Screenplay (Bhansali and Vashishtha).[12] At the 68th Filmfare Awards, the film received a leading 17 nominations and won a leading 11 awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Bhansali), and Best Actress (Bhatt).[13]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn the year 1956, a 15-year girl named Madhu from Ratnagiri district is tricked and sold into prostitution by a pimp, into a brothel in Kamathipura, the red-light district of Bombay, the capital of Bombay State. \nShe is tortured by brothel madame Rashmibai for not consenting to become a sex worker. Unable to convince Madhu, Rashmibai approaches Gangubai, the most influential madame in Kamathipura to persuade the girl. Gangubai meets Madhu and tells her her own story in order to inspire her to embrace prostitution.\nBorn into an affluent family in Kathiawad, Ganga Jagjivandas Kathiawadi, the daughter of a barrister, aspired to become a Bollywood actress. At the age of 16 she ran away from home with her older boyfriend, Ramnik Lal, to Bombay, as he promised Ganga a film career under the tutelage of his aunt Sheela. \nIn reality, Ramnik was actually a groomer and a pimp & had sold Ganga to a brothel owned by Sheela [a] for Rs 1000, where she was forced into becoming a prostitute. There she changes her name to Gangu. While there, she befriends a fellow prostitute named Kamli. Gangu is valued by Sheela due to her beauty & wits. \nAt the brothel, Gangu introduced labour rights by advocating for prostitutes to observe days off from work once in a week. A local goon named Shaukat Abbas Khan visits the brothel, violently assaults Gangu (which leaves her hospitalised) as a part of his sexual fantasies & refuses to pay. Since Sheela refuses to take action against the man because she wanted to indirectly teach Gangu a lesson. Gangu goes to Shaukat's boss, mafia leader Rahim Lala for justice. A man of principles, Rahim Lala is horrified when Gangu shows him the bruises caused by Shaukat & at the same time impressed by Gangu's fearlessness. He declares Gangu to be his sister & brutally beats Shaukat when he again comes to solicit Gangu at the brothel. Gangu earns the adoration of the fellow prostitutes for her quest to seek justice & fear from Sheela due to Rahim Lala's backing for her. \n9 years after she entered into the flesh trade, Gangu is made the madame of the brothel by other prostitutes after Sheela's death. From then on, she is referred to as Gangubai [b], and goes on to become a powerful figure of Kamathipura. 3 years have passed since then.\nGangubai initially tries to dissuade Madhu from returning home by narrating incidents of women who escaped sex trafficking being killed by their own relatives in the name of saving the family honour. \nHowever when Madhu remains steadfast in her decision of not entering into prostitution, Gangubai (who saw the reflection of her own past in Madhu) frees her from the brothel and sends her back home safely.\nGangubai decides to stand as a candidate in the presidential elections of Kamathipura against the incumbent, a hijra named Raziabai who has won unopposed for the last 2 years & is renowned for ruthlessness. Gangubai utilises her act of kindness in saving Madhu for electoral propaganda against Raziabai. Raziabai tries to intimidate Gangubai to make her drop out from the elections but Gangubai refuses. With the help of Rahim Lala, Gangubai arranges for the illegal sale of alcohol from her brothel in order to raise money for her election campaign & the living standards of the prostitutes under her control. Raziabai secretly tipped off the local police about this, but they were unable to gather evidence against Gangubai, who swiftly took things under control by bribing the local inspector-in-charge. After this incident, Gangubai worked quickly to erode Raziabai's support base by broadcasting Bollywood movies in her part of Kamathipura free of charge with the help of one of her clients for the entertainment of the prostitutes in order to prevent them from attending a meeting where Raziabai was about to deliver a speech. Raziabai mocks Gangubai's attempts by stating that defeating Raziabai is as impossible as bringing a marriage procession to Kamathipura. So Gangubai arranges for the marriage of Roshni, the virgin daughter of a fellow prostitute named Kusum (who didn't want her daughter to become a prostitute & had attempted to protect Roshni from her clients' gaze by keeping her locked away after sedating her with opium) with a Muslim tailor named Afsaan Razzaq, whose uncle used to sew clothes for her. Afsaan & Gangubai were in love with each other, but Gangubai convinced him to marry Roshni instead by stating that as a sex-worker, she can't marry anybody. She also convinced Afsaan's disapproving uncle & aunt to accept Roshni as their niece-in-law by paying a large dowry. The arrival of Afsaan's marriage procession[c] was a huge spectacle, previously unheard of in Kamathipura. All of this contributed to Gangubai winning the elections by a huge margin. In the role of Kamathipura's president, she advocates for civil rights of prostitutes. While in office, Gangubai gets to call her family via telephone for the first time in 12 years and finds out that her father has died and her family has not forgiven her for running away. Gangubai pushes forward the concept of prostitutes enjoying holidays by calling for the celebration of Navaratri in Kamathipura, accompanied by lights, festive decorations, music & garba (which she enjoyed while living in Kathiawad) and voluntarily refraining from business on the 9th day of the celebrations[d]. \nAfter the celebrations are over, Gangubai is informed by Rahim Lala that a local Catholic girl's school situated near the red-light district has started a campaign to evict prostitutes from the area over concerns of the school's students falling under the bad influence of sex-workers, & taking advantage of the campaign a local builder wants to demolish the brothels & construct skyscrapers on the land. Gangubai protests, stating that the school is barely 40 years old while the history of prostitution in Kamathipura dates back to at least a century & once evicted, the 4,000 prostitutes of Kamathipura will have nowhere to go. Rahim Lala accordingly intimidates the builder's agent from forcibly evicting the prostitutes and warns Gangubai to prepare herself to be sued and brought to court.\nAfter the matter reaches court, Gangubai walks into the school principal's chamber in order to get the children from her brothel admitted into the school. She offers 5 years' fees for all 8 girls on the spot and suggested that providing education to children born to prostitutes but abandoned by their biological fathers so that they can choose careers other than prostitution is a better way to abolish sex-trade than evicting prostitutes. The girls are enrolled in front of a journalist from the 'Bombay Urdu Times', Mr. Hamid Faizi, who was present there & is sympathetic to the cause of education for the children born in brothels. However, after Gangubai leaves, the children are beaten by the nuns and thrown out of the school on their first day. Faizi thus decides to publish Gangubai's interview regarding the campaign to evict prostitutes in the newspaper to support her cause. At the same time, Kamli falls ill after giving birth and dies, so Gangubai takes in Kamli's child, Pammi. After the interview gets appreciated by the readers, Faizi arranges for Gangubai to deliver a speech at a feminist meeting held on Azad Maidan. In her speech, Gangubai points out the inherent misogyny of the society which labels prostitutes as immoral but not the men who visit them. She states that while politicians talk about ending discrimination in the country along lines of caste, creed, colour & religion, prostitutes who actually follow these ideals in real life while giving their services face discrimination & have been pushed to the margins of the society. She then states that by satisfying the sexual appetite of anti-social elements & unfaithful husbands, prostitutes play a vital role in decreasing domestic & sexual violence against other women in streets & households, but their contribution goes unnoticed. She also says that she will continue to fight for the right of  prostitutes' children to receive an education and for prostitutes to be given respect in society. After her speech goes viral, Faizi arranges for Gangubai's meeting with a local politician in her brothel. In exchange for providing support in the upcoming elections, Gangubai asks the politician to make the school authorities withdraw the petition from the court by his influence. However, the politician initially refuses, saying that the school authorities had filed a PIL to the Supreme Court in this matter. Gangubai agrees to provide support to the politician after he assures her of arranging her meeting with the Prime Minister. \nGangubai goes to New Delhi to meet with the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru & requests him to legalize prostitution in the country, but Nehru refuses. Gangubai then describes how people who indulge in trafficking girls into prostitution go unpunished, while the innocent girl is victimized throughout her entire life, how prostitutes, who face discrimination while availaing the basic civic amenities like buying subsidised food from ration shops, availing treatment from government hospitals, getting financial service from banks & availing justice from law-&-order agencies like police stations and courts, were now on the brink of homelessness due to the campaign against them & how children of prostitutes were being denied the right to avail education. After discussion, the Prime Minister eventually agrees to set up a committee to investigate the status of prostitution in the country & block the brothels of Kamathipura from being vacated. As prostitution becomes legalized while making trafficking of girls & soliciting sex illegal[e], Kamathipura celebrated its continued existence, thanks to Gangubai Kathiawadi. \nThe film ends by saying, \"To cry was her destiny, but to smile was her nature. Gangu wanted to become a heroine, but this wretched girl became an entire cinema by herself.\"\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAlia Bhatt as Gangubai Kathiawadi, a female mafia don and madame of a brothel in Kamathipura (character loosely based on Gangubai Kothewali)\nAjay Devgn as Rahim Lala, a mafia don of South Bombay of Afghan origins & Gangubai's sworn brother (character loosely based on Karim Lala)[14]\nShantanu Maheshwari as Afsaan Badr-ur-Razzaq, a tailor from Calcutta who came to Bombay for learning the trade from his uncle.\nVijay Raaz as Raziabai, a castrated male sex-worker of Kamathipura\nIndira Tiwari as Kamli, a prostitute who became Gangu's best friend & worked in the same brothel\nSeema Pahwa as Sheela, the madame who purchased Ganga\nVarun Kapoor as Ramnik Lal,[15] a pimp who pretended to be in love with Gangu & then proceeded to sell her into prostitution.\nJim Sarbh as Journalist Hamid Faizi\nRahul Vohra as Prime Minister (character based on Jawaharlal Nehru)[16]\nAnmol Kajani as Birju, Gangubai's butler\nPrashant Kumar as Badri, Sheela's (& later Gangubai's) henchman\nRaza Murad as the builder's agent\nChhaya Kadam as Rashmibai, a fellow madame of Kamathipura\nMitalee Jagtap as Kusum, a prostitute who became Gangu & Kamli's friend and worked in the same brothel as them.\nPallavi Jadhav as Rama, a prostitute of Kamathipura\nKruti Saxena as Nimmi, a prostitute from Kamathipura\nSonal Sagore as Banno,  a prostitute from Kamathipura\nLata Singh as Lata,  a prostitute from Kamathipura\nEkta Shri as Ekta,  a prostitute from Kamathipura\nAbhirami Bose as Abhirami,  a prostitute from Kamathipura\nChum Darang as Chum,  a prostitute from Kamathipura\nBaldev Trehan as Afsaar's uncle\nJahangir Khan as Shaukat Abbas Khan, a sadistic client who hurts Gangu\nFaiz Khan as Liaquat, Rahim Lala's henchman\nRakesh Bhavsar as Jugnu, a man who tried to molest Gangu when she led a group of her fellow prostitutes to watch cinema in a nearby theatre while observing a day off from work.\nRoshan Chatterjee as Pinku, Raziabai's henchman\nHuma Qureshi as Dilruba, a Qawali singer (special appearance in the song \"Shikayat\")[17]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe news about an adaptation of one of the chapters of Hussain Zaidi's book Mafia Queens of Mumbai first came out in June 2017 with Priyanka Chopra attached to star as the leading character.[18] The film's earlier title was Heera Mandi.[19] In March 2019, Chopra confirmed that she was working on a project with Bhansali, who also confirmed that he was making Gangubai Kathiawadi with Chopra.[20] However, in September 2019, media reported that Alia Bhatt, who was supposed to do a different film, titled Inshallah, by Bhansali was going to replace Chopra after Inshallah got shelved.[21] Principal photography begun in Film City, Mumbai on 27 December 2019.[22][23][24]\n\nCasting[edit]\nThe film marks the Hindi cinema debut of television personality Shantanu Maheshwari, who portrays Gangubai's boyfriend Afsaan.[25] and TV actor Varun Kapoor to debut as the grey role of Ramnik Lala.[26]\n\nFilming[edit]\nProduction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the lockdown ordered by the Indian government owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, when the film was 70% complete.[27] Bhatt resumed work on 6 October 2020, and Ajay Devgn who is playing a cameo joined sets on 27 February 2021.[28] The film was wrapped up on 26 June 2021.[29][30][31]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nGangubai KathiawadiSoundtrack album by Sanjay Leela BhansaliReleased18 February 2022[32]Recorded2021StudioSonic Bliss StudioGenreFeature film soundtrackLength45:20LanguageHindi & TeluguLabelSaregama MusicSanjay Leela Bhansali chronology\n\n\nMalaal(2019)\n\nGangubai Kathiawadi(2022)\n\nTBA\nOfficial audioGangubai Kathiawadi - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film score is composed by brothers Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara, while the songs featured in the film are composed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali with lyrics  written by A.

On the second day, the film collected \u20b913.32 crore (US$1.7\u00a0million). On the third day, the film collected \u20b915.30 crore (US$1.9\u00a0million), taking total domestic weekend collection to \u20b939.12 crore (US$4.9\u00a0million).[9]\nAs of 14\u00a0April\u00a02022[update], the film grossed \u20b9153.69 crore (US$19\u00a0million) in India and \u20b955.56 crore (US$7.0\u00a0million) overseas, for a worldwide gross collection of \u20b9209.25 crore (US$26\u00a0million), recovering its budget and emerging as a commercial success.[9] The film grossed over \u20b9209.77 crore (US$26\u00a0million) worldwide, becoming the fifth highest grossing Hindi films of 2022.[91] Bollywood Hungama and Box Office India stated that the film's box-office verdict of a \"hit\".[92][93][94][95]\n\nImpact[edit]\nGangubai Kathiawadi is credited as one of the films which has revived the movie business post COVID-19 pandemic.[96] It is considered as an ice-breaker for Bollywood since it was the among few Hindi film to pull audiences back to the cinema halls after the pandemic.[97][98] Bollywood Hungama noted that Gangubai Kathiawadi's commercial performance has given the much-needed hope to the industry that the box-office in the near future would fire up even more. They also noted Bhatt's ability to shoulder a film on her own and stated, \u2018\u2018Actresses often are not able to do so and need the help of a male actor to get audiences to cinemas. Alia, on the other hand, stands out and she doesn't need any hero's support. Without a male actor, she has managed to deliver a film that's all set to enter the \u20b9100 crore club and that speaks volumes\u2019\u2019.[94]\nAdditionally, Bollywood Hungama further noted that, there's a belief that the cinema-going audience primarily consists of males. As a result, testosterone-driven films aimed at men would have a high chance of succeeding and fairer sex can't make a film a hit. However, Gangubai Kathiawadi's box office performance proves that even women audiences can take the film into the 'hit' or even the 'super-hit' zone.[94] Bhatt's look in Gangubai Kathiawadi inspired Malaysia's Northern Haute Couture Fashion Show 2022.[99][100] Deadline Hollywood noted that Gangubai Kathiawadi proved to be a \u2018\u2018rare-breakout\u2019\u2019 for a female-led Bollywood feature.[101][102] Actress Bhumi Pednekar credited Gangubai Kathiawadi for encouraging her to do female-lead films.[103] Cultural professor Rachel Dwyer referred Gangubai Kathiawadi as Bhansali's version of 1972 cult classic, Pakeezah. She drew parallels between Bhatt's and Meena Kumari's character and wrote, \"Gangubai may be seen as a version of Sahibjaan/ Pakeezah, who finds herself in the great modern city of Bombay/Mumbai rather than in the courtly world of the then Hindustan, just as Meena Kumari was a heroine of the post-Independence cinema, the way Alia Bhatt is of today\u2019s post-Bollywood\".[104] Outlook magazine called Gangubai Kathiawadi a modern-day classic and credited it for setting the stage for a shift in audience's taste.[105]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nMain article: List of accolades received by Gangubai Kathiawadi\nReferences[edit]\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ brothel madames are euphemistucally referred to as aunts in India\n\n^ 'Bai' is a honorific suffix added to the names of Hindu women in western India meaning 'lady'\n\n^ In India, it is customary for the bride's side of the family to organise the marriage ceremony & the groom must come to the bride's house with a marriage party to attend the ceremony\n\n^ considered holy by Hindus\n\n^ through the passage of the Immoral Traffic (Suppression) Act that year\n\n\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Gangubai Kathiawadi\".
