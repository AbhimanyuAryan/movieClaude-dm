It was jointly produced by Loneranger Productions and Houseful Motion Pictures, and presented by Mahesh Bhatt and K Sera Sera Vikram Bhatt Productions. The film stars Akshay Oberoi and Aindrita Ray, alongside Meherzan Mazda.[2]\nThe film was completely shot inside K Sera Sera and Vikram Bhatt's newly set up Studio Virtual Worlds, using virtual production (VP) technology, with the support of Unreal Engine.[3] Judaa Hoke Bhi was released on 15 July 2022.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nAman and Meera are a married couple. Aman dislikes when Meera discusses practical matters such as bills, EMIs, and household finances. He prefers to drink excessively and sing at random bars rather than in a studio that offers payment. We later discover that Aman's drinking is attributed to the loss of their only son years ago. Meera, a successful writer, receives a highly lucrative 'ghost' writing assignment in a secluded location in Uttarakhand. Just as Meera prepares to leave, Aman gets into an accident and falls into a coma.\nMeera chooses to forego the assignment and stays by Aman's bedside. To change her decision, the person offering the assignment sends an efficient creature or ghost to the hospital where Aman is admitted. The creature disguises itself as a nurse on leave and persuades a ward boy to replace Aman's medicine with alcohol. This convoluted plan succeeds, as Meera detects the alcohol, becomes angry with Aman, and reconsiders her plan to go to Uttarakhand.\nUpon arriving in Uttarakhand, Meera is promptly warned by a seemingly random yet convincing middle-aged blind man with a Yamdoot-like aura to flee for her safety. Strangely, she ignores this advice. The blind man then tries to frighten and convince Aman to rescue Meera. Aman eventually agrees and heads to Binsar.\nIn Binsar, Meera's new boss is deeply interested in exotic pets and herbs that enhance his allure to women. When Aman arrives to rescue Meera from the palace, a girl named Rohi, the blind man's daughter, aids them in escaping. However, at the train station, Meera experiences intense stomach pain, caused by her boss's powers. Aman admits Meera to a nearby hospital, where she admits to having an affair with her boss. Her demeanor suddenly shifts to a more sinister tone, and she joins her boss.\nAman returns to the blind man's house, seeking assistance. The blind man reveals that Meera's boss is actually his great-great-grandfather named Virbhadra, who lived 300 years ago and was a village temple priest. Virbhadra had a brother named Bhaskaracharya. During a plague outbreak in the village, the brothers helped the villagers, but Virbhadra contracted the plague. He beseeched the goddess for help, but his plea went unanswered. That night, a ghost named Kali offered him eternal youth in exchange for two tasks: contaminating the pure temple pond water and killing a woman with unique birth circumstances every 12 years. It is later unveiled that the monster in control of Meera's boss is none other than Ruhi.\nFinally, Aman rescues his wife and takes her back. It is then revealed that this was all a dream, and Aman remains in the hospital after his accident. In the end, both Aman and Meera hold a funeral for their son, concluding the film.\n\nCast[edit]\nAkshay Oberoi as Aman Khanna[5]\nAindrita Ray as Meera\nMeherzan Mazda as Siddharth Jaiwardhan\nJiya Mustafa\nRushad Rana\nPuneet Tejwani\nProduction[edit]\nIn March 2022, K Sera Sera and Vikram Bhatt announced the setting up of their new virtual production (VP) studio named Studio Virtual Worlds.

Concluding her review Khurana wrote, \"All said, this overstretched drama is way too cliched and soppy to hold your attention, but it does amuse you in its own unique ways. The performances and the soulful music definitely make this 122-minute drama worth a one-time watch.\"[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Judaa Hoke Bhi\u2026 Box Office\".
