(2012), and stars Akshay Kumar, Pankaj Tripathi and Yami Gautam Dhar.[10]\nThe film was theatrically released on 11 August 2023 to positive reviews from critics.[11] It has grossed over \u20b9221 crore (US$28\u00a0million) worldwide, emerging as the tenth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2023.[12] At the 69th Filmfare Awards, the film received nine nominations, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Critics) (Tripathi) and Best Supporting Actress (Gautam),[13] and won the award for Best Story.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nNote: The original film had Akshay Kumar playing Lord Shiva but the censored theatrical version consists of him playing a messenger of Lord Shiva. This narrative is written in the censored release's context, treating Akshay's character as a messenger\nKanti Sharan Mudgal, a loyal devotee of Lord Shiva, owns a shop outside the city's prominent Mahakaal temple. One day, he is called to the hospital and told that his son Vivek has been up all night masturbating continuously until he fainted, having taken multiple Viagra tablets. Vivek's friend explains that an insecure Vivek was bullied about the size of his penis and was told that masturbating will make it bigger. The biology teacher at school refused to answer Vivek's questions, leading him to shady people and drugs, and eventually to the hospital. \nThe school chairman Atal Nath Maheshwari tells Kanti about a recent video showing Vivek masturbating in the school washroom. As this is affecting the school's image, Vivek is rusticated on grounds of obscenity. Kanti's friend, Pandey Ji, a rich priest at the temple, advises him to leave town as the situation is tarnishing their religious image.\nThe video reaches Kanti's wife and daughter and their entire neighborhood. They begin to be shamed by society. Devastated, Kanti prays to Lord Shiva for help, when a divine power shines in the Temple and a Messenger sent by Lord Shiva arrives.\nAfter a police complaint against Vivek for trying to murder his bully, The Messenger meets Vivek and Kanti at the police station, saying he's there to lodge a complaint of his missing bag, where he comforts Vivek.\nVivek tries to commit suicide twice but is saved by The Messenger. He meets Kanti as they're about to leave town, and tells him that his son did nothing wrong, using the example of a breastfeeding mother to explain that not everything done in privacy is wrong or obscene. It is the school's fault for not educating him properly and Kanti's fault for not guiding him properly. He advises Kanti to file a case against the school and the medical practitioners. \nKanti files a case against the school, the chemists, the doctor, and himself. When opposed with the fact that he is just promoting vulgarity by defending his son's act, he holds the point in court that the Hinduism and Indian culture was always inclusive of conversations on sex, also showing the intimate human art carvings of Ellora, Ajanta, and Khajuraho temples, and quoting multiple books that he found from a random bag to get his case accepted. Pandey Ji asks Kanti to leave his given house and shop as this case will tarnish their religious image. \nThe opposition lawyer, Kamini Maheshwari says Kanti is doing all this to cover up his son's vulgar act. Kanti argues that if the school had included sex education in their courses, his son wouldn't have been so misinformed. The Messenger often visits to give Kanti indirect advice on how to continue the case.\nKamini calls a sex worker to court, whose son studies in the same school, to prove a point that the school is very noble. Kanti asks the prostitute if she ever enjoys her work, to which she says that those ignorant men don't know anything about a woman's body and how to treat it with respect. Kanti says if the schools taught sex education to young boys, they'd know how to respect a woman's body, adding that even her own son shouldn't become like the ignorant men who come to her for pleasure, to which the entire courtroom is left speechless. He bows down to her calling her a brave mother and teacher.\nAs the case continues, Kanti points out issues regarding pornography, rape, drugs, and the importance of sex education. The school chairman offers him ten million (one crore) to take his case back. Kanti falls into the emotional trap of his son's future and signs the contract. He gets into an accident and apparently dies. The Messenger visits him in the hospital, who criticises his decision of losing faith, and finally reveals himself to be a divine manifestation sent by Lord Shiva. He shows Kanti that his efforts have come to light as Pandey Ji's granddaughter reveals to her family the sexual abuse she's been going through, thanks to Kanti's case being shown on TV. Kanti realises his mistake and is reincarnated and taken to court.\nAt the hearing, Vivek arrives for the first time and proves through his research that colonisers ruined India's education system, which was actually inclusive of sex education in the ancient times. Teens from the crowd come forward saying they masturbate too and it's not a sin, including the Judge's own son. Kanti wins the case as the education board is ordered to make sex education compulsory and payment be given to Kanti, and Vivek be taken back into the school.\nKanti introduces the Messenger to his family as \"the doctor who treated him\" and offers Him all the money instead of the temple. The Messenger then reveals that the lost bag was his, and asks Vivek to keep it with him, with the cultural and religious books inside it. He then says he has another patient to attend to, and drives away, leaving a happy Kanti with praying hands behind.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAkshay Kumar as Lord Shiva's messenger[14]\nPankaj Tripathi as Kanti Sharan Mudgal[10]\nYami Gautam Dhar as Advocate Kamini Maheshwari\nPavan Malhotra as Judge Purushottam Nagar\nGovind Namdev as Pandey Ji\nArun Govil as Chairman Atal Nath Maheshwari\nBrijendra Kala as Dr Gagan Malvia\nShriidhar Dubey as Chandu Padiyal\nAarush Varma as Vivek, Kanti's son\nGeeta Agrawal as Indumati Kanti Sharan Mudgal\nAnvesha Vij as Damayanti, Kanti's daughter\nHemant Kumar Choudhary as Nagdev Sir, Biology Teacher\nVijay Mishra as Advocate Ajab Bundela\nKshitij Pawar as Hawaldar Laalchand\nYash Bhojwani as Anup\nShruti Gholap as Mughda Ma'am\nRajiv Kachroo as Sunil D'Costa\nVedika Nawani as Sophie\nBhavesh Babani as Shaurya, Judge Nagar's Son\nVeena Mehta as Chandu's Mother\nKaran Aanand as Praful Maheshwari\nJyoti Tiwari as Pandeyji's Daughter in Law\nAashriya Mishra as Pandeyji's Grand Daughter\nAjoy Chakraborty as Defendant Advocate\nPratap Verma as Maulvi\nNamrata Kapoor as Mona's Mother\nHemant Soni as Middle Aged Man\nManoj Dutt as Kanti's Doctor\nShiv Kumar Verma as Protesting Man\nParag Chhapekar as Medical store owner\nAarya Sharma as Female Prostitute\nSunil Shroff as Principal Makwana\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment and casting[edit]\nThe film was initially rumoured to be in making in January 2021 with Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal returning as leads post the first part, but Rawal denied the reports.[5] In June 2021, the sequel to OMG was finally confirmed with a new storyline starring Kumar.[15][10] Pankaj Tripathi and Yami Gautam were roped in as new additions that same month, while Arun Govil joined the cast in November 2021 as the school Chairman.[16]\n\nFilming[edit]\nTripathi began the first schedule of the film on 2 September 2021 in Mumbai.[17] Akshay Kumar joined the sets in second schedule on 23 October 2021.[18][19] The third schedule of the film commenced in December 2021.[20]\n\nMusic[edit]\nOMG 2Soundtrack album by Vikram Montrose, Hansraj Raghuwanshi, Djstrings, Pranaay, Sandesh Shandilya and KashhReleased8 August 2023Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength16:52LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioOMG 2 - Full Album on YouTubeSingles from  OMG 2 \n\"Oonchi Oonchi Waadi\"Released: 18 July 2023\n\"Har Har Mahadev\"Released: 27 July 2023\n\n\nThe background music of the film is composed by Mangesh Dhakde, while the soundtrack is composed by Vikram Montrose, Hansraj Raghuwanshi, Djstrings, Pranaay, Sandesh Shandilya and Kashh.

It was also suggested that Kumar's character in the film, which was initially supposed to be that of Lord Shiva, to be changed to that of a \"Messenger of God\". The makers felt that this would spoil the essence of the film and limit its appeal and insisted on receiving an (U/A) (Unrestricted public exhibition subject to parental guidance for children below the age of twelve) certificate. The film was eventually passed by the Censor Board with an (A) (Adults Only) certificate with no cuts but with 25 modifications.[25][26][27][28][29] The film was theatrically released on 11 August 2023.[11]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film was premiered on Netflix from 7 October 2023.[30]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of 12 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10.[31]\nA critic for Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote \"On the whole OMG 2 is a bold, powerful, progressive, and sensitively handled film with powerful performances as its USP.\"[32] Renuka Vyavahare of The Times Of India rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote \"OMG 2 shows you how a film can be entertaining, socially relevant and informative. You don\u2019t need to leave your brain behind to have a good laugh. Take your family along to watch this interesting blend of social commentary and humour.\"[33] Tushar Joshi of India Today rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote \"Overall, 'OMG 2' is a film that has the right mix of everything. In short, it succeeds in being an entertainer with a valid message. Akshay Kumar's fans will be in for a huge treat where the actor delivers one of his career-best performances.\"[34]\nGanesh Aaglave of Firspost rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote \"OMG 2 is a film, which should be watched by the audience of all the age groups as it delivers a social message, which is the need of the hour across the nation.\"[35] Dishya Sharma of News18 rated the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote \"OMG 2 is unlike OMG: Oh My God. The first part had a little more comedy and a breezy approach. However, OMG 2 is heavy on dialogue and serious. Although it could feel preachy, it deserves a watch.\"[36] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote \"A mainstream Hindi film taking up cudgels on behalf of the proponents of catching \u2018em young? Speaking straight and true? Mentioning the wonders of the Kamasutra? Opening up syllabuses to include sex education? Yes, yes, and yes. Omg.\"[37]\nIn a negative review, Rahul Desai of Film Companion wrote \"When the film belatedly wakes up to its own chauvinism, it throws in a few quick nods to the link between sexual repression and abuse. Most of them reek of tokenism.\"[38] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote \"To sum up, OMG 2 aspires to be as sharp as a scalpel but is actually as blunt as the back of a knife.\"[39]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAs of 7 September 2023, the film has grossed \u20b9178.77 crore (US$22\u00a0million) in India, with a further \u20b942.31 crore (US$5.3\u00a0million) in overseas, for a worldwide total of \u20b9221.08 crore (US$28\u00a0million).[40]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n28 January 2024\n\nBest Film\n\nCape of Good Films, Viacom18 Studios, Wakaoo Films\n\nNominated\n\n[41][42]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nAmit Rai\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor (Critics)\n\nPankaj Tripathi\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nYami Gautam\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Story\n\nAmit Rai\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Dialogue\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Editing\n\nSuvir Nath\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nNikhil Kovale\n\nNominated\n\nImpact[edit]\nUlhasnagar Education Society announced addition of Sex education in their syllabus post the release of the film.[43][44]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"OMG 2\".
