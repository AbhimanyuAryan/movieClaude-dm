The film starts with a party scene in Singapore where Sajni, Shraddha and others are celebrating Sajni's birthday. She was apprehensive about partying at a nightclub, but her fianc\u00e9, Siddhant Kadam, boosted her confidence by asking her to behave like a modern woman. Shinde decided to let go of her inhibitions and enjoy the night. After few drinks, Sajni went for a free wheeling dance and videos are shot and accidentally posted online to the school website by Shraddha.  As a young school teacher from a small town stuck between traditional values and modern ambitions, Sajini found herself in a nightmarish situation when the video of hers went viral and evoked a adverse response in her city, in her school and in her hometown, Ahmednagar. While she returns to India, she was promptly sacked from the school by  Kalyanai, the Principal, under pressure from outraged parents and committee members. She requested the Principal to reinstate her, but she did not agree. \nHer father is a reputed theater actor, autocratic and her family is conservative. She realized that she has no where to go. The story proceeds with Sajini disappearing after writing a suicide note on her social media blaming her family and boyfriend for the suicide. Her best friend raises enough of a stink for the sleepy Pune cops to wake up.This incident turns into a major public debacle and the police are presurized into taking definitive steps to investigate Sajini's disappearance. Inspector Barot and Inspector Ram were deputed to solve the case.\n\nCast[edit]\nNimrat Kaur as Inspector Bela Barot\nRadhika Madan as Sajini Suryakant Shinde\nBhagyashree as Kalyani Pandit\nSubodh Bhave as Suryakant Shinde, Sajini's father\nSoham Majumdar as Siddhant Kadam, Sajini's fianc\u00e9e\nChinmay Mandlekar as Inspector Ram Pawar\nShruti Vyas as Shraddha Oswal, Sajini's friend\nSumeet Vyas as Adv.
