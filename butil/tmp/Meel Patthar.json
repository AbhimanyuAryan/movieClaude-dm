Gil Son\nProduction[edit]\nThe film is partially in Punjabi language as the protagonist is Punjabi who is working in the New Delhi region.[9] It was shot in January and February in 2020.[10] Ayr said that the film \"tells you where you are and how much further you have to go.\" Further explaining: \"Like how we say there is a significant moment or milestone one has crossed, that is there in the film. He gets to a certain milestone which he is unaware of and certain things begin to happen which makes things uncertain.\"[9] After the nationwide lockdown was imposed, Ayr got the film edited and sound-mixed from a remote location. The film was shot in a village in Haryana.[11] To get into how truck drivers operate, Ayr spent time with several one of them for the research in Delhi and Chandigarh.[11] Both the actors took truck driving lessons for their role.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nMeel Patthar received mostly positive response from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 11 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10.[12]\nNamrata Joshi noted that the film \"offers a brooding look at lives constantly on the move, yet always paused.\"[13] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote: \"This sublimely multi-layered film embraces the personal struggles of its characters with as much passion as it portrays the manifestations of the social inequities that are an intrinsic part of their existence.\"[14] Stutee Ghosh of The Quint said, \"A cinematic milestone, Ivan Ayr\u2019s Meel Patthar is a moving portrait of a man lacerated by the truth of life.\"[15] Baradwaj Rangan praised the film and wrote: \"This moving tale of a trucker paints a portrait of an ecosystem where everything and everyone appears to be a metaphor for disuse, neglect, ageing.\"[16] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film \"a poignant, lyrical look at the life of a truck driver.\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Meel Patthar (Milestone)\".
