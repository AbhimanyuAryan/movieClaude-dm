But for reasons unknown, Hindi cinema has been on a remaking spree and in most cases, this hasn\u2019t worked in their favour.\"[25]\nPinkvilla praised the supernatural-thriller film U-Turn, with special mention for Alaya F's performance. According to Jogani, the film was concise, efficient, and highly engaging. The narrative's pacing held the audience's attention throughout, with strong performances from the entire cast. Overall, U-Turn is a must-watch for those who appreciate gripping storytelling and exceptional acting.[26]\nOn April 28, 2023, Hindustan Times published a review of the movie which received positive feedback from Monika Kukreja. Kukreja specifically highlighted Alaya F's performance as a journalist who delved into the dangers of a hazardous road.[27]\nPrakriti Bhat of Mens XP wrote \"You\u2019ll watch the film for the plot but the performances will stay with you even after the film is over\".[28]\nSimran Srivastav of Jagran wrote \"Alaya F as Radhika Bakshi gives an earnest performance in the film but does not get enough chance to show off her acting chops. Priyanshu Painyuli is convincing as Senior Inspector Arjun Sinha and complements Alaya on the screen very well\".[29]\nA critic from Scroll.in wrote \"The Hindi remake, written by Parvez Sheikh and Radhika Anand, makes a few welcome changes to the source material. Routinely performed and staged, U-Turn bumbles along on its gimmicky premise and the promise of smart twists at judiciously placed intervals\".[30]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Alaya F starrer U-Turn to release directly on ZEE5 on April 28\".
