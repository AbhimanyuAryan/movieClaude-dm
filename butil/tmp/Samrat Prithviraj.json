The film is based on Prithviraj Raso, a Braj language epic poem about the life of Prithviraj Chauhan, a king from the Chahamana dynasty.[14] It features Akshay Kumar as the titular character, while Manushi Chhillar makes her Hindi film debut playing the role of Sanyogita. The film also stars Sanjay Dutt, Sonu Sood, Manav Vij, Ashutosh Rana and Sakshi Tanwar in other pivotal roles.\nAn official motion poster of the film was released by Yash Raj Films on 9 September 2019, revealing its release in cinemas on Diwali 2020.[15] Principal photography began in Jaipur on 15 November 2019, but was suspended in March 2020 owing to COVID-19 pandemic in India, due to which the film was indefinitely postponed. The film's shoot resumed in October 2020 at YRF Studios. Originally titled Prithviraj, the film was renamed as Samrat Prithviraj following a court litigation a week ahead of its scheduled release.[16] The film was released on 3 June 2022.\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It was made on a reported budget between \u20b9150 crore (US$19\u00a0million) and \u20b9300 crore (US$38\u00a0million),[12] and amassed a worldwide gross collection of \u20b990.32 crore (US$11\u00a0million),[13] making it a huge box office failure.[17][18]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn 1192 CE at Ghazni in Afghanistan Prithviraj is captured by Muhammad Ghori where he forces him to fight against three lions. A blinded Prithviraj is able to kill all of them but faints due to weakness.\nThe story then shifts back a few years in Kannauj where princess Sanyogita, Jayachand's daughter, is in love with Prithviraj Chauhan who is ruling Ajmer. Prithviraj is approached by Mir Hossain who is the brother of Ghori. Hossain eloped with Chitralekha, a dancer in Ghori's kingdom, as both loved each other which caused a rift with Ghori. Prithviraj assures Hossain that he will help him and takes him into his kingdom. This act angers Ghori and he decides to attack Ajmer if Prithviraj does not send Hossain back to him. Ghori sends Qutb ud-Din Aibak to Ajmer. Prithviraj rejects Ghori's demand. As Aibak warns him, Prithviraj accepts the demand for a war. This results in the First Battle of Tarain where Prithviraj along with Kaka Kanha, Chand Bardai and his men are able to defeat Ghori's army, but Hossain is killed in the battle. Meanwhile, Ghori is captured by Prithviraj, but after few days he is released.\nPrithviraj is selected as ruler of Delhi. This angers Jayachand. He warns that the consequences of this act will not be good. Jayachand decides to organise a Svayamvara for Sanyogita and a Rajasuya Yagya to grow his empire. He also sends an invitation to Prithviraj, asking 50 per cent control on Delhi, which Prithviraj refuses. Jayachand decides to make a statue of Prithviraj on the doorway of his empire, as he had rejected the invitation and as per the rituals if someone rejects the invitation a statue can fill the position of that person. As the svayamvara starts, Sanyogita decides to put the varmala on Prithviraj's statue. This angers Jayachand. He decides to punish his daughter, but soon Prithviraj approaches with his army and takes Sanyogita as she had chosen Prithviraj as her husband. A furious Jayachand decides to attack Prithviraj but is stopped by his advisors. Soon Prithviraj and Sanyogita get married according to their rituals. After a few days, Jayachand sends his army to attack other forts under Prithviraj. Soon his army captures Gaudpur Fort. While Prithviraj, Sanyogita, Chand Bardai and others are outside, Kaka Kanha along with Prithviraj's army decides to recapture Gaudpur fort. They are successful in recapturing the fort, but Kaka Kanha and many other men of Chauhan are killed in the battle. Prithviraj decides to attack Jayachand, but soon reverses the decision, as Kaka Kanha's last wish for Prithviraj was to forgive Jayachand. Later, Prithviraj decides to give equal position to Sanyogita in his darbar. This decision is opposed by other courtiers, but soon Prithviraj manages to get their approval by telling them about the importance of women in society.\nJayachand decides to contact Muhammad Ghori through a merchant and asks him to capture Prithviraj. In exchange, he will handover anything Ghori wants. Ghori sends Aibak to Delhi. Aibak asks Prithviraj to work under Ghori's rule or he should prepare for another war. Prithviraj accepts the offer of war with Ghori. This results in the Second battle of Tarain. As the battle continues, Ghori's army decreases. Ghori then decides to attack Prithviraj during night when his army is sleeping. Ghori's army is successful in defeating Prithviraj's army and captures Prithviraj, taking him back to Ghazni. As Ghori's army is approaching Delhi, Sanyogita and other Rajput women perform jauhar (mass suicide by immolation). Ghori refuses to give Prithviraj to Jayachand, thus leaving him shattered with the loss of Ajmer and his daughter.\nDelhi is now ruled by Ghori's men. As Prithviraj was captured by Ghori, Ghori asks his men to blind Prithviraj. Prithviraj is forced to fight with lions, but soon defeats them. He then asks Ghori that if anyone wants to attack him he should first call his name to attack and Chand Bardai should be allowed to help him through his words and poems. Soon Prithviraj faints. The next day, the blind Prithviraj is given 7 chances to save his life along with his army's. Ghori's men conclude that Prithviraj will be given 7 arrows along with a bow and if he is able to kill one man out of the 7 then he will be released. Prithviraj rejects the offer and asks Ghori for only one chance, with one arrow and Ghori himself should come face to face to kill him. Ghori accepts the condition and faces Prithviraj on the battlefield. As Ghori is approaching, Chand Bardai recites a poem to Prithviraj. Inspired through the poem Prithviraj then shoots an arrow into the neck of Muhammad Ghori, instantly killing him. Chand Bardai jumps to Prithviraj to hug him, but both are killed by arrows shot by Ghori's men. Prithviraj's men are released from prison as per the condition. They take the dead bodies of Chauhan and Bardai to perform the final rites.\nThe film ends with a note that Prithviraj Chauhan was the last Hindu ruler of Delhi before the Islamic Conquest and rule on India for nearly 565 years (1192-1757). As Hindustan became independent in 1947 after many years of foreign rule, Prithviraj Chauhan's death was justified through freedom.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nAkshay Kumar as Prithviraj Chauhan[19]\nVarun Buddhadev as a young Prithviraj Chauhan, nicknamed \"Prithvi\"\nManushi Chhillar as Sanyogita[20]\nSanjay Dutt[21] as Kaka Kanha\nSonu Sood as Prithvi Chand Bhatta / Chand Bardai[22]\nManav Vij as Muhammad Ghori[23]\nAshutosh Rana as Jayachandra[24]\nSakshi Tanwar as Jayachandra's wife[25]\nLalit Tiwari as Kannauj Purohit[26]\nGovind Pandey as Jayachandra's Senapati[27]\nManoj Joshi as a wealthy merchant\nArun Bali as Arnoraja\nRajendra Gupta as Thakurbaba, Prithviraj's adviser\nVikas Shrivastav as Jayachandra's guard\nSahidur Rahaman as Qutb-ud-din Aibak\nKranti Prakash Jha as a general of Samrat Prithviraj's army\nKamaljeet Rana as Baluk Rai\nProduction[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(June 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nDevelopment[edit]\nSamrat Prithviraj is primarily based on Prithviraj Raso, a Braj language epic poem about the life of Prithviraj Chauhan, a king from the Chahamana dynasty.[28][29] Chandraprakash Dwivedi had completed script for Prithviraj in 2010, and his first choice for Prithviraj's role was Sunny Deol, with Aishwarya Rai as Sanyogita.[30] However, due to Deol's date issues and no production house interest, he left the project and it was almost shelved, but Dwivedi wanted to still make Prithviraj and after struggling for many years in finding a producer to come on board for him, Yash Raj Films offered to produce the film in 2018, thus reviving the film.[20][failed verification]\nIn March 2019, Akshay Kumar confirmed that he had been persuaded to star as Prithviraj.[21][failed verification] The film's official announcement was made on Kumar's 52nd birthday (9 September 2019), with a motion poster released on social media.[19]\n\nCasting[edit]\nIt was rumoured before the announcement of the film that Sanjay Dutt would be joining a film with Akshay Kumar. In September 2019, after the announcement of the film, Dutt confirmed that he would be joining Prithviraj.[31] Manav Vij was cast for the role Mohammed Ghori.[23] In November 2019, Manushi Chhillar was confirmed to play the role of Sanyogita, Prithviraj's love interest, making her Bollywood debut and replacing Rai.[20] Later, Sonu Sood and Sakshi Tanwar also joined the cast.[22][25] It also stars Lalit Tiwari, Ajoy Chakraborty and Govind Pandey in supporting roles.[26]\n\nFilming[edit]\n\nReported budget\n\n\nSource\nBudget (crores \u20b9)\n\n\nInternationalBusiness Times\n300\n\n\nAmar Ujala\n300\n\n\nNavbharat times\n300\n\n\nAsianet News\n300\n\n\nIndia TV\n200+\n\n\nThe Indian Express\n\n200\n\n\nBollywood Hungama\n200\n\n\nMint\n175\n\n\nBusiness Today\n150+\n\nPrincipal photography commenced on 15 November 2019 with a puja ceremony[32] at Jamwaramgarh, Jaipur, Rajasthan, and a song was shot in January 2020, but the filming was stopped in March 2020 due to the Coronavirus lockdown in India ordered by the Indian government, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.[33][failed verification]\nAhead of the 2020 monsoon season, the sets created in Rajasthan were taken down because the cost of maintaining them during the coronavirus lockdown was too high. With no filming expected to take place before the monsoon season, the two sets erected in Dahisar \u2013 one of a palace and one of an arena made for an action sequence \u2013 were destroyed. Instead, an indoor set was decided to be set up for resumption of filming.[34]\nAfter 6 months, shooting was resumed at YRF Studios in October 2020.[35] Kumar was spotted at the sets on 10 October 2020, while Sood and Chhillar were a part of this schedule too.[36] Filming wrapped up in February 2021.[37]\nDifferent news sites have reported different budget with values ranging between \u20b9150 crore (US$19\u00a0million)[38] and \u20b9300 crore (US$38\u00a0million).[39][40]\n\nRelease[edit]\nCertification[edit]\nThe Indian censor board gave the film U/A certificate. Films certified U/A contain moderate adult themes, that is not strong in nature and can be watched by a child below 12 years of age under parental guidance.[41] The censor board demanded five cuts and adjustments. The committee examining the film asked a disclaimer to clarify that the people associated with the film did not support or promote Johar (Jauhar), Sati or any other similar activity. Some of the words in the dialogues were changed. The Hindi word haran (translation: abduct) was replaced with waran (select); Nana with sage; kabza (occupation) with hamla (attack); and antim (last) with mahaan (great).[42]\n\nLitigations[edit]\nIn February 2022, the Delhi High Court dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Rashtriya Pravasi Parishad, after the petitioner asked for a withdrawal. The petitioner sought to change the name of the film from Prithviraj to Great Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan, claiming that using Prithviraj Chauhan's name without prefixes is disrespectful.[43]\nIn March 2022, the organisation Karni Sena started protesting against the film, seeking assurance from the makers that the film would not tamper the historic facts.[44] On 27 May 2022, the title of the film was changed from Prithviraj to Samrat Prithviraj due to PIL issued by Karni Sena.[16][45]\nGurjar Samaj Sarv Sangthan Sabha Ekta Samanya Samiti, a Gurjar organisation, sued the film makers in the Delhi High Court and alleged that the film depicted Prithviraj as a Rajput king, and claimed that he was rather a Gurjar king. The petitioners said that the film is based on Prithviraj Raso, which states Chauhan as a Gurjar king. The petitioners also submitted Wikipedia article about the movie, among others, as an evidence.[14] They claimed that Prithviraj's portrayal as a Rajput would hurt the sentiments of Gurjar community. The film makers responded that the film is caste neutral and does not depict Chauhan as a Gurjar or a Rajput; but portrays him as an Indian warrior and king.[46] The petitioners stated that their grievance was resolved if the film is caste neutral. The court said that the filmmakers were bound by their statement in the court and then disposed off the plea.[14]\n\nTheatrical release[edit]\nThe film was earlier announced for cinema release on 13 November 2020, coinciding with Diwali.[47] However, it was postponed due to production halt between March and October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[27] The film was scheduled to release in theatres on 21 January 2022 in 2D[48] and IMAX,[b] but postponed due to spread of Omicron variant.[51] Finally, film was theatrically released on 3 June 2022 in Hindi and dubbed versions of Tamil and Telugu languages only.[50]\nThe film's release was banned in Kuwait and Oman.[52] In Qatar the release was put on hold.[53]\nPrior to the release, the film was declared tax-free in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttarakhand.[54][55][56]\n\nHome media[edit]\nThe film started digitally streaming on Amazon Prime Video from 1 July 2022.[57]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nSamrat Prithviraj received mixed reviews from critics.[58] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 18% of 11 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10.[59]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"As befits its simplistic, shorn-of-nuance tone, this Akshay Kumar-Manushi Chhillar film is larger-than-life and stays completely faithful to its stated intent\".[60] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"A historical drama of this magnitude needed more than just a big budget. It required a sharper eye, a larger vision and a greater degree of integrity, none of which is within its grasp\".[61] Anuj Kumar reviewing for The Hindu wrote \"Director Chandraprakash Dwivedi\u2019s film seeks to revive cultural nationalism, but doesn\u2019t serve the purpose of those who wish to reap the past for a political harvest\". He further said that Akshay Kumar has disappointed in the lead role and that the film \"neither does justice to its source nor its subject\".[62] Tanul Thakur of The Wire in his review said, \"There's absolutely no sense of character or plot progression throughout \u2013 people seem like tacky mission statements; subplots are heaps of propagandistic infomercials. There's no sense of intrigue or discovery, turning the entire film into an insufferable road trip\".[63]\nTatsam Mukherjee of Firstpost rated the film 1 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Samrat Prithviraj unfolds like a straightforward sequence of Wikipedia entries: early childhood, first battle, marriage, second battle, death, legacy\".[64] A critic for Pinkvilla rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Samrat Prithviraj is strictly an average affair, with a rather flat screenplay. The historical is primarily watchable due to three strong sequences:The opening act, the intermission block, and the finale, but the brave Indian warrior deserved a better film.[65] Nairita Mukherjee of India Today rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"If Bollywood's fate rests on Samrat Prithviraj, the future is blank\".[66]\nRachana Dubey of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Samrat Prithviraj is a well-performed and well-directed family drama. It doesn\u2019t have the opulence that we have seen in other historical dramas\".[67] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"It\u2019s fondly trying to recreate a time when everything was just and honourable, while also showing that it\"s our own disunity which allowed the invaders to step in\".[68] A critic for Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The Akshay Kumar film Samrat Prithviraj is an inspiring and entertaining saga of one of the greatest kings of Indian history\".[69] Bohni Bandyopadhyay of News 18 rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Akshay Kumar and Manushi Chhillar starrer evokes sentiments of patriotism and Rajput valour, trying to recreate the dramatic love story of Samrat Prithviraj and princess Sanyogita\".[70] Deepa Gahlot of Rediff rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Akshay Kumar plays the part with enthusiasm, like he was just waiting to get into the costume of a historical hero\".[71]\nGeeta Pandey of BBC wrote that the film is riddled with historical inaccuracies. Some criticised the movie being made under the BJP government to paint India's Muslim minorities as outsiders and cruel invaders.[72]\n\nBox office[edit]\nSamrat Prithviraj was released in 5,000 theatres worldwide.[18] It earned \u20b910.7 crore (US$1.3\u00a0million) at the domestic box office on its opening day.[73] This earning was less than the expected earning of \u20b915 crore (US$1.9\u00a0million) for first day.[39][40] The opening weekend was expected to recover the earnings; however it fell short of expectation with an earnings of \u20b912.6 crore (US$1.6\u00a0million) and \u20b916.1 crore (US$2.0\u00a0million) on Saturday and Sunday respectively.[73]\nThe film faced heavy competition from Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 and Vikram.[74] On Monday, the fourth day after the release of the movie, the earnings have collapsed amounting to about \u20b95 crore (US$630,000), less than 50% compared to the opening day.[73] The morning shows of the film started getting cancelled due to zero occupancy in theatres. The shows that were not cancelled had single-digit occupancy. The Indian Express reported the film having a downward trend and turned out to be a box office flop.[18] The reduction and cancellations of the shows was attributed to an abundance of screens forcing the occupancy to be low.[73]\nAs of 30\u00a0July\u00a02022[update], the film grossed \u20b981.01 crore (US$10\u00a0million) in India and \u20b99.31 crore (US$1.2\u00a0million) overseas, for a worldwide gross collection of \u20b990.32 crore (US$11\u00a0million).[13]\nAfter the poor performance theatrically, YRF planned to recover some of the production costs by releasing the film early on Amazon Prime Video, for streaming.[75]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nSamrat PrithvirajSoundtrack album by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013LoyReleased19 May 2022[76][77][78]Recorded2021StudioYRF StudiosGenreFeature film soundtrackLength23:00 (All languages)LabelYRF MusicProducerAditya ChopraShankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy chronology\n\n\nDhaakad(2022)\n\nSamrat Prithviraj(2022)\n\n\nOfficial audioSamrat Prithviraj - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's soundtrack consists of five songs, four of which are composed by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy and 1 song \"Aigiri Nandini\" is composed by Alap Desai, while the film score was composed by Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara.[76]\n\nAll lyrics are written by Varun GroverHindiNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Hari Har\"Adarsh Shinde4:142.\"Hadd Kar De\"Neeti Mohan, Keerthi Sagathia4:023.\"Makhmali\"Arijit Singh, Shreya Ghoshal4:044.\"Yoddha\"Sunidhi Chauhan4:035.\"Aigiri Nandini\" (Music by Alap Desai)Alap Desai, Rahul Chitnis, Vivek Naik, Saurabh Wakhare, Raghav Dave, Mahavir Kubadia2:546.\"Prithviraj Theme\"Instrumental1:457.\"Sanyogita\u2019s Theme\"Manya Narang1:58Total length:23:00\nAll lyrics are written by Madhan KarkyTamilNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Avan Avan\"Diwakar4:142.\"Azhaikiradhae\"Neeti Mohan, Yazin Nizar4:023.\"Menmayaay\"Haricharan, Chinmayi, Yazin Nizar4:044.\"Undhan Padai Anbae\"Sunidhi Chauhan4:035.\"Aigiri Nandini\" (Music by Alap Desai)Alap Desai, Madhan Karky2:546.\"Prithviraj Theme\"Instrumental1:457.\"Sanyogita\u2019s Theme\"Manya Narang1:58Total length:23:00\nAll lyrics are written by Chaitanya PrasadTeluguNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Hari Hara\"Diwakar4:142.\"Haddhu Cheripey\"Neeti Mohan, Yazin Nizar4:023.\"Mrudhumayee\"Haricharan, Chinmayi, Yazin Nizar4:044.\"Yoddha\"Sunidhi Chauhan4:035.\"Aigiri Nandini\" (Music by Alap Desai)Alap Desai, Chaitanya Prasad2:546.\"Prithviraj Theme\"Instrumental1:457.\"Sanyogita\u2019s Theme\"Manya Narang1:58Total length:23:00\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The Print[2] reported the budget to be \u20b9150 crore.
