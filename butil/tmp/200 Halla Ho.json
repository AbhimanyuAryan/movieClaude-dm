The film is based on the real life incident in which 200 women lynched Akku Yadav, a gangster, robber, serial rapist, and killer in an open court in Nagpur in 2004.[1] It was digitally released on 20 August 2021 on ZEE5.[2][3]\n\n\nCast[edit]\nAmol Palekar as Justice Vitthal Daangle\nBarun Sobti as Umesh Joshi\nIshtiyak Khan as Prof. Avsare\nSahil Khattar as Bali Choudhary\nUpendra Limaye as Suresh Patil\nRinku Rajguru as Asha Surve\nFlora Saini as Poornima\nIndraneil Sengupta as IPS, Sameer Deshpande\nPradhuman Singh as Anwar Sheikh\nSaloni Batra as Purva\nApurva Choudhari as Jyoti\nSushama Deshpande as Tarabai Kamble\nVinay Hake as the Reporter\nPunit Tiwari as Santosh\nSahana Vasudevan as Neha\nReception[edit]\nArushi Jain of The Indian Express gave the film a mixed review and stated, \"Though a torpid screenplay fails the subject of the movie, veteran actor Amol Palekar stays committed to the character of a retired Dalit judge. He brings some profundity to a film that lacks depth.\"[4] Archika Khurana of The Times of India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated, \"If you like non-fiction films based on true stories, this drama definitely deserves a watch in order to comprehend the grief and suffering that those women must have endured.\"[5] R.M. Vijayakar of India West gave the film a mixed review and stated, \"This film may not be a must-watch in the way it is made, but it is certainly not a waste of resources and audience time like Yoodlee\u2019s social thriller past excesses.\"[6] Mumbai Live gave the film a mixed review and stated, \"The movie leaves a lasting impact on your mind and one wonders that no matter how much we talk about equality, there are certain sects that are still struggling to get the respect they deserve.\"[7] Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri of The Free Press Journal gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated, \"If only it did not wear its activism, its social agenda, on its sleeves, it would have been more than the polemic tract it often feels like.\"[8]\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"Drawing strength from a slew of quietly efficient performances, the director parlays the material into an impactful tale of crime and punishment that transcends genre limitations.\"[9] News 18 praised its \"decent\" production values, tone, pacing, \"powerful\" performances and \"dramatic\" direction.[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Zee5 Global's '200- Halla Ho' tells: Dalit lives matter too!\".
