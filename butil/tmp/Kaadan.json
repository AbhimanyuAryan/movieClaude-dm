The theatrical release of Haathi Mere Saathi was put on hold which subsequently opted for a direct-to-video release on Zee Cinema and Eros Now on 18 September 2021.[5] The film was promoted as a comic strip by famous children's magazine, Tinkle as Little Bandev.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThis section needs an improved plot summary.

Hindi actress Zoya Hussain was signed to play a role.[8] Rana Daggubati shed 15 kilograms for this film by eating vegetarian food for six weeks.[9][10][11] The makers initially announced Kalki Koechlin to play a role in the film, however, she was replaced by Shriya Pilgaonkar.[12] Vishnu Vishal was signed to play a role in the Tamil and Telugu versions while Pulkit Samrat will reprise his role in the Hindi version.[13][14]\n\nRelease[edit]\nInitially scheduled for release on 2 April 2020, the film release was then indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[15][16] before being rescheduled to be released on 15 January 2021 to coincide with Pongal festival.[17] In January 2021, the film has been announced to release on 26 March 2021.[18]\nIn March 2021, owing to the COVID-19 situation, the release of Hindi version Haathi Mere Saathi has been postponed. Tamil and Telugu versions, however, are released as scheduled.[19] The Hindi version is set to have a direct-to-video release on the television channel Zee Cinema followed by the streaming platform Eros Now on 18 September 2021.[20] The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamil for Tamil Version and Telugu version was sold to Zee Telugu\n\nMusic[edit]\nKaadanAranyaHaathi Mere SaathiSoundtrack album by Shantanu MoitraReleased17 March 2021 (All languages)[21][22][23]Recorded2019-20GenreFeature film soundtrackLength\n14:23 (Tamil)\n14:22 (Telugu)\n14:25 (Hindi)\nLanguageTamilTeluguHindiLabelEros MusicProducerEros International\nThe music for the film has been composed by Shantanu Moitra and lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire (Hindi version) and Vanamali (Tamil and Telugu versions).\n\nTamilNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Thaalaattu Paadum\"Haricharan4:532.\"Chinna China\"Haricharan4:243.\"Idhayame\"Javed Ali5:06Total length:14:23\nTeluguNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Chitike 'Se' Aa Chirugaali\"Haricharan4:532.\"Vellu Vellu\"Haricharan4:243.\"Hrudayame\"Javed Ali5:06Total length:14:22\nHindiNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Shukriya\"Rituraj Mohanty4:532.\"Dheeme Dheeme\"Adriz Gosh4:263.\"Ae Hawa\"Javed Ali5:06Total length:14:25\nReception[edit]\nAranya[edit]\nThe Times of India critic Suhas Yelupantla rated the film 3.5 stars of 5 and calling it an \"engaging ride.\" He added that, \"The first few minutes of the film are among the best. The visual effects, backed by the background score is spot on. The portrayal of the elephants is even better.\"[24]\nSangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu felt that the film could have been better, and added \"Rana singularly tries to hold things together, trying to save the elephants as well as the film.\"[25] Hemanth Kumar, in his review for the Firstpost, also echoed the same, stating that: \"Rana Daggubati's film on ecosystem conservation, is educational but exceptionally insipid.\"[26] The Indian Express journalist Manoj Kumar rated the film 2/5 and called it \"sub-standard.\" He added that Aranya was redeemed by its cinematography, Resul Pookutty's sound design, and Daggubati's acting.\"[27]\n\nKaadan[edit]\nA reviewer from Sify called it a \"noble attempt.\" They termed \"Rana and his earnest performance as Kaadan\" and \"AR Ashok Kumar's splendid cinematography\" as the film's main highlights.[28] Haricharan Pudipeddi of Hindustan Times opined that the film was predictable and added: \"its grandeur merely used as a gimmick to project the film on epic scale.\" Pudipeddi appreciated Daggubati's performance, calling it \"one of his best till date.\"[29] M. Sugandh in his The Times of India review wrote: \"Prabu Solomon is more interested in telling us a story. It is only in the climax that the filmmaker starts to sermonise, which feels unnecessary given that we get the movie's 'message' even without the need for any underscoring.\"[30]\n\nHaathi Mere Saathi[edit]\nNDTV's Saibal Chatarjee rated the film 2/5 and opined that the film rode on Daggubati's shoulders. He added that Solomon delivered the message on increasing deforestation in a gratuitously high-pitched manner, completely devoid of nuance.[31] Writing for the Rediff.com, Sukanya Verma gave a negative review and said: \"Between bad writing, hysterical acting and a shoddy blend of CGI and the real deal, Haathi Mere Saathi completely neglects the message of saving our elephants.\"[32]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Ghosh, Devarsi (22 March 2021). \"How Rana Daggubati lost weight and gained new insights into nature for 'Haathi Mere Saathi'\".
