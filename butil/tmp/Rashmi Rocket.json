M. Vetticad of Firstpost said \u201cHere for a change is a Hindi film that knows how to portray male allies without allowing them to cross the line into male saviour territory. Here for a change is a Hindi film featuring female adversaries sans the all-women-are-enemies-of-women stereotype, and spotting female allies in unexpected places.\u201d[14]\nWriting for Scroll, Nandini Ramnath said, \u201cLight on its feet and often as fleet as Rashmi, the movie cruises along on the strength of several heart-warming scenes (many of them involving Rashmi\u2019s tough-loving mother Bhanu), a foot-tapping folksy score by Amit Trivedi, and basic insights into the debate over hyperandrogenism that continues to rage in all manner of sport.\u201d[15]\nRonak Kotecha of The Times of India gave the film four stars and said, \u201cNanda Periyasamy\u2019s riveting story, Aniruddha Guha\u2019s sharp screenplay and Akarsh Khurana\u2019s able direction, holds your attention right from the beginning until the end, where the race for justice is played out in a court.\u201d About lead actor Taapsee Pannu, the publication said, \u201cTaapsee Pannu once again proves her mettle, embodying Rashmi\u2019s persona, physically and mentally. Her effort to celebrate Rashmi\u2019s victory and endure her pain, is as real as it gets and the actress doesn\u2019t miss the beat when it comes to making us root for her character.\u201d[16]\nShubhra Gupta, in her review of the film in Indian Express, wrote: \"When you see Taapsee Pannu\u2019s Rashmi fighting the good fight, for herself and for other athletes who have been done against in similar fashion, you want to cheer. For keeping sporting women on top, and for the very worthy cause.\"[17]\nIn his review for Cinema Express, critic Avinash Ramachandran wrote: \"It is brave of Taapsee to do a film where the battle against the system takes paramount importance, and rightly so.\"[18]\nZee News said in its review that \"Akarsh Khurana's Rashmi Rocket has an unconventional storyline that can greatly contribute to conversations around gender equality.\"[19]\nIn her review for Mashable, Sushri Saha writes, \"With strong performances led by Pannu and a well-written screenplay, the film does justice to the issues it raises and challenges.\"[20]\nCritic Shomini Sen, in her review for WIONews, wrote that Rashmi Rocket \u201cis an important film. It treads on an unknown track and it shines because of its important message.\u201d\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of the ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n67th Filmfare Awards\n\n30 August 2022\n\nBest Film\n\nRonnie Screwvala, Neha Anand, Pranjal Khandhdiya\n\nNominated\n\n[21]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nAkarsh Khurana\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nTaapsee Pannu\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nAbhishek Banerjee\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Story\n\nNandha Periyasamy\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Dialogue\n\nKanika Dhillon\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Production Design\n\nDurga Prasad Mahapatra\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nNeha Parti Matiyani\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nRohit Chaturvedi\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nBest Editing\n\nAnjay Sharma, Shweta Venkat Mathew\n\nNominated\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Taapsee Pannu shares a cheerful picture from the sets of 'Rashmi Rocket'\".
