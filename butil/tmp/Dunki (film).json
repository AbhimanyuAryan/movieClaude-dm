At the 69th Filmfare Awards, the film received nine nominations, and won Best Supporting Actor for Kaushal.[6]\n\n\nPlot\nIn 2020, an elderly Manu Randhawa runs away from a hospital in London (UK) and meets immigration lawyer Puru Patel. Puru connects her with her ex-lover Hardayal \"Hardy\" Singh Dhillon in Laltu, Punjab. Hardy is ecstatic to receive her call after 25 years. She asks him to meet her in Dubai (UAE) so he can bring her back to India through the Dunki route as she is unable to get an Indian visa.\nIn 1995, Manu and her friends Buggu and Balli, live in Laltu and yearn to immigrate to London for a better life. Poor and uneducated, they are unable to procure a visa until Hardy, a former Soldier, arrives in their village. Manu's brother Mahinder had saved his life in combat but has since died in an accident, leaving Manu and her family in a poor financial situation. Hardy promises to help Manu reach London in return for her brother's kindness. Learning that passing the IELTS test makes it easier to get a UK student visa, they enroll in a coaching class handled by Geetu Gulati, where they meet Sukhi Singh. Sukhi wants to travel to London to save his ex-girlfriend, Jassi. She was married off to an NRI man who physically abuses her. Balli clears the exams but the rest fail.\nOnce in London, Balli tells Sukhi that Jassi has died by suicide due to which Sukhi immolates himself. Traumatised by his death, Hardy resolves to take Manu and Buggu to London himself through the Dunki route. After a treacherous journey through Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey during which three of their cohorts are killed, they reach London, where they meet Balli working as a living statue. They realise that Balli had lied to them about making it big in the UK; in reality, he is poor and lives with other illegal immigrants.\nLawyer Puru Patel advises Manu to do a sham marriage as an easy way to get UK citizenship. She reluctantly agrees to marry a drug addict. During the wedding, Hardy is enraged by the addict's attempt to kiss her, and they fight, resulting in their arrest. In court, Puru advises them to seek right of asylum to stay in the country by claiming that their lives are under threat in India. As an ex-army soldier, Hardy refuses to betray his country, but the rest agree to get asylum and settle in England. Hardy is deported to India while the rest become British citizens.\nBack in 2020, Manu tells Hardy that she wants to go back home as she is dying of a brain tumor. They try to leave for India via cargo containers and fool immigration officials into believing they are Indian citizens traveling illegally to London and steal the identity of the cohorts that died during their trip to London; they are thus deported to India. Once in Laltu, Manu is shocked to learn that Hardy never married out of love for her. Moments after he proposes, she dies from her ailment. Heartbroken, he puts the engagement ring in her hands and hugs her. After a few months, Hardy, Balli, and Buggu meet an agent who offers them to go to London through the Dunki route. Hardy throws him down on the ground and then all three of them walk away.\n\nCast\n\nTaapsee Pannu as Manu Randhawa\nShah Rukh Khan as Hardayal \"Hardy\" Singh Dhillon\nVicky Kaushal as Sukhi Singh\nBoman Irani as Geetendar \"Geetu\" Gulati\nVikram Kochhar as Balindar \"Buggu\" Lakhanpal\nAnil Grover as Balli Kakkad\nJyoti Subhash as Santosh Lakhanpal, Buggu's grandmother\nDeven Bhojani as Advocate Puru Patel\nManoj Kant as Manu's father\nArun Bali as Manu's older father\nAmardeep Jha as Manu's mother\nSuhail Zargar as Mahinder Randhawa, Manu's brother\nJaanvi Sangwan as Mahinder's wife\nVishnu Kaushal as Gulab Nagra\nKomal Sachdeva as Chameli Nagra\nDiwanshu Gambhir as Parminder \"Pumpi\" Dingra\nRohitashv Gour as a Fake Visa Agent at Laltu\nPiyush Raina as Owner of Bobby dhaba\nJitendra Hooda as an Indian Dunki Agent\nMushari Alatawi as an Iranian Dunki agent\nShahid Latief as Bakir, a Saudi Arabian Dunki Agent\nMahavir Bhullar as Buggu's father\nSapna Sand as Buggu's mother\nJatinder Kaur as Balli's mother\nJeremy Wheeler as a British Judge\nJay Miller as Church Priest\nArpa Attila as Buggu's manager in London\nRichard B.

The website's consensus reads: \"Dunki's got good intentions and no shortage of heart, but its uneven tonal blend and shallow treatment of serious themes undermines the intended effect.\"[66]\nTushar Joshi of India Today gave 4/5 stars and wrote \"Dunki might not be Hirani's best work in comparison to 3 Idiots or PK, but it still entertains and leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling\".[67] Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India also gave 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Dunki's story is an emotional one - rolling in friendship, romance, heart-wrenching and heart-warming moments all into one. And in trademark Hirani style, there are dollops of comedy which is laced with satire to make it an entertaining ride, along with the strong message the film brings forth\".[68] A reviewer for Pinkvilla considered it \"a modern-day classic\", but was critical of the film's pace.[69] A reviewer from Bollywood Hungama awarded the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Dunki bears the Rajkumar Hirani stamp of filmmaking with the right message and emotions as a backdrop. However, it is not as outstanding as his previous films as the writing plays spoilsport to a great extent.\"[70] Filmfare's Devesh Sharma was pleased by the film's messaging of \"a world beyond borders\", and praised the performances of Khan and Pannu.[71] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times labelled it a \"heartwarming tale that's high on emotions\", but despite praising the performances of Khan and Pannu, she was displeased with their chemistry.[72] Proma Khosla of IndieWire rated the film C+ and wrote \"In the end, Dunki undermines its own messaging, sandwiching a series of informative cards about donkey flights between a rushed conclusion and comedic coda.\"[73]\nNDTV's Saibal Chatterjee believed that the film's strength lay in its ability to not be in service of Khan's stardom, instead allowing the supporting cast to shine, particularly Vicky Kaushal.[74] A reviewer for Film Companion also believed that Kaushal's special appearance had enhanced the \"simplistic\" film.[75]  Writing for The Hindu, Anuj Kumar considered Dunki \"not the best of Hirani but has just about enough to make you chuckle and churn\".[76] Mint Lounge's Uday Bhatia compared it negatively to The Dupes (1973), a Syrian film about border crossing, writing that unlike that film, Dunki \"is only interested in illegal immigration and the refugee crisis to the extent that it allows Hirani and Khan to grandstand\".[77]\nSukanya Verma of Rediff.com rated the film 2.5/5 and opined, \"Dunki is high on ambition but its flimsy premise renders this nearly three hours long journey into farfetched adventures hard to believe, harder to buy into\".[78] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in dismissed the film as \"flat and unfunny\", adding that the \"strangely anodyne film is briefly enlivened by Khan's dimpled charm and spirited turns by Taapsee Pannu, Vikram Kocchar and Anil Grover\".[79] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 1.5/5 stars and criticised it as a \"crashing bore\" and considered it Hirani's weakest film.[80]\nInternationally, Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News rated the film 4/5 and wrote \"Illegal immigration and unauthorised cross-border migrant crossings are grim issues, but director Rajkumar Hirani humanized them with an emotionally engaging tale\".[81] David Tusing of The National wrote \"With Dunki, Khan takes on a poignant immigration tale with a whole lot of heart that's bound to strike a chord with audiences\".[82]\n\nBox office\nDunki had the 13th-biggest advance booking of all time for a Hindi film.[83] On its opening day, it collected a net total of \u20b928 crore (US$3.5\u00a0million) in India and \u20b958 crore (US$7.3\u00a0million) worldwide.[84][85] It had net domestic collections of \u20b920 crore (US$2.5\u00a0million) and \u20b924.5 crore (US$3.1\u00a0million) on its second and third day, respectively.[4][86][87] On its fourth day, the film collected \u20b932 crore (US$4.0\u00a0million) in India and crossed the \u20b9100 crore mark domestically. It also crossed the \u20b9200 crore mark worldwide on the same day.[88] After 7 days of its run, the film collected \u20b9300 crore worldwide, making Shah Rukh Khan the first Indian actor to give a cumulative worldwide gross of \u20b92500 crore with films in a single year.[89] On its thirteenth day, Dunki collected \u20b93.85 crore (US$480,000) net in India and crossed the \u20b9200 crore mark domestically, and the \u20b9400 crore (US$50\u00a0million) mark worldwide.[90]\nAs of 7 February 2024, Dunki has grossed \u20b9262.25 crore (US$33\u00a0million) in India, with a further \u20b9196.68 crore (US$25\u00a0million) in overseas, for a worldwide total of \u20b9458.93 crore (US$57\u00a0million).[91]\n\nAccolades\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n28 January 2024\n\nBest Actor\n\nShah Rukh Khan\n\nNominated\n\n[92][93]\n\n\nBest Actress\n\nTaapsee Pannu\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nVicky Kaushal\n\nWon\n\n\nBest Music Director\n\nPritam\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Lyricist\n\nJaved Akhtar for \"Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nSwanand Kirkire and IP Singh for \"Lutt Putt Gaya\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Male Playback Singer\n\nArijit Singh for \"Lutt Putt Gaya\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nSonu Nigam for \"Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se\"\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Choreography\n\nGanesh Acharya for \"Lutt Putt Gaya\"\n\nNominated\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ According to Pinkvilla, the combined cost of producing and marketing the film was \u20b9120 crore.[3]\n\n^ \"Dunki\" loosely translates from Punjabi to English to mean \"to hop from place to place\".[5]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Dunki review: Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee try too hard in a dated film\".
