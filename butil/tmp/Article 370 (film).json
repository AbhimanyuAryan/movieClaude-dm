With an impressive writing, simple narrative and outstanding direction, it effortlessly manages to send across the message it intends to\".[24]\nMukund Setlur, writing for the Deccan Herald gave a rating of 2.5/5 and added that \"While elements of drama and action are aplenty, the film lacks the intelligence and the genuineness needed to sustain a conversation.\"[25] The Koimoi gave it a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and noted that the movie aims to promote propaganda by terming itself as fiction but the characters of the movie depicting the Prime minister and the Home minister entirely resembles the current PM Narendra Modi and HM Amit Shah.[15]\n\nCritics praised the performance of Yami Gautam\nCalling it a \"hard-hitting political drama\", Titas Chowdhury of CNN-News18 rated 3.5 out of 5 stars, and stated that \"the makers waste no time and dive into the crux of the story in the first half and it makes for a fast-paced experience till the point of intermission. It's the second half of the film that appears stretched out\".[26] Lachmi Deb Roy of Firstpost awarded 3 out of 5, calling it a \"compelling narrative that informs and engages without making it look like a history and civics lesson. Article 370 is a true story of Kashmir's tortured history that had to be corrected and the maker of the film did complete justice to it!\".[12] Asmita Pant of CNBC TV18 wrote that \"the film offers a grounded perspective on the Kashmir issue. It delves deep into emotions but never interrupts the story's flow\", and that \"the filmmakers have eschewed sensationalism for a factually accurate narrative infused with cinematic flair\".[27]\nSana Farzeen of India Today rated 3 out of 5 stars and added that \"Article 370 is a well-made film but will test your patience with its run-time of 2 hours and 40 minutes\", also noted that the film is \"tuned to the propaganda value\" for the ruling government.[28] Shalini Langer of The Indian Express rated 2.5/5 and added that the film \"serves its politics unabashedly as it mixes facts with fiction\".[16]\nCritic from Bollywood Hungama gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it \"a gripping tale that attempts to depict an important chapter of India\u2019s history in an entertaining and simple manner.\"[10] Rohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal rated 3 in a scale of 5, stating that \"Yami Gautam\u2019s film voices truth but in a textbook manner ... Away from the picking political sides or even having his own ideology in place, Aditya sheds light on what had happened and that\u2019s like cherry on top\".[29] Abhimanyu Mathur of Daily News and Analysis awarded 3.5 out of 5 stars, and said that \"it is a technically well-made film, packed with great performances, seamless direction, and a solid background score\"; it \"excels when it is being a thriller\", however, \"the film falters when it tries to get political. Because at this point, it resorts to boring tropes, caricatures, and over-the-top acting\".[30]\n\nFactual accuracy and political messaging\nThe film is focused on Article 370 of the Constitution of India which granted special autonomous status to the region of Jammu and Kashmir. However, the critics have described the movie as \"factually incorrect\" and a \u201cdistortion\u201d of facts.[14][13]\nIndian PM Narendra Modi had endorsed the movie and claimed it to be a source of \"correct information\", however, producer Aditya Dhar clarified that the movie is not a factual account but a work of fiction inspired by the actual events.[31] The movie is seen as a \"thinly veiled propaganda film\" that favors India's ruling Bharatiya Janta Party in order to bring political mileage for it during the upcoming 2024 Indian general elections.[32][33] The movie was made tax-free in two of the BJP governed states, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The film screening in different states was attended by the BJP leaders and in some instances they campaigned for the movie and the elections.[34]\nThe film has been noted for having numerous factual inaccuracies, and one-sided narrative.[31] It depicts the first Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru to have delayed the accession of the Jammu and Kashmir princely state until Sheikh Abdullah was allowed power.[17] This is contrary to the fact that Kashmir ruler Hari Singh had aligned himself with the Indian government only after his kingdom was attacked by the Pakistanis.[25][35]\nAt the same time, the film is silent on the BJP's coalition government with the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party.[17] The film normalises custodial beating and torture by presenting it as a necessary act against those who are \"deserving it\".[31] It further shows contempt to the institutions of democracy including the opposition and the journalists.[25]\n\nBox office\nAs of 11 April 2024, Article 370 has grossed \u20b998.06 crore (US$12\u00a0million) in India, with a further \u20b912.51 crore (US$1.6\u00a0million) in overseas, for a worldwide total of \u20b9110.57 crore (US$14\u00a0million).[3]\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Aricle 370 (12A)\".
