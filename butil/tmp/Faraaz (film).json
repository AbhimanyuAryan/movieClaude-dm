Kukreja praised the lyrics of the song \"Musafir ko ghar he aana hai\" saying, \"[the] highlight of Faraaz remains the soulful, moving lyrics. written and composed by Sameer Rahat. Concluding Kukreja wrote, 'Faraaz doesn't set out to send you home with a moral lesson yet puts across its point very subtly.\"[19]\nDishya Sharma of News18 rated the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Faraaz is a trademark Hansal Mehta film and is not for the weak-hearted. The film is bound to leave you disturbed and empty by the end of it.\" \n[20] Renuka Vyavahare writing for The Times of India rated 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, \"Hansal Mehta\u2019s acclaimed body of work is testament to his sensibility\".

It doesn't revolve around Faraaz, it revolves solely around the attack he lost his life in & hence, it shold've been named accordingly.\"[23]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2 out of 5 ratings.[24]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n28 January 2024\n\nBest Film (Critics)\n\nHansal Mehta\n\nNominated\n\n[25]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nAditya Rawal\n\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nPratham Mehta\n\n\nBest Sound Design\n\nMandar Kulkarni\n\n\nBest Male Debut\n\nAditya Rawal\n\nWon\n\n[26]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ refers to Faraaz Ayaaz Hossain, who metaphorically stood 'tall' and refused to abandon his two friends at the time of attack.[2]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Faraaz Box Office Collection\".
