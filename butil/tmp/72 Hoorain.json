The film had a delayed theatrical release in India on July 7, 2023, to positive reviews.[2][3][4] However, it emerged as a modest earning independent film.[5]\nThe film was earlier premiered at the 50th IFFI 2019, where it received standing ovation, and won the ICFT-UNESCO Gandhi Medal-Special Mention for Best Film on peace and inter-cultural dialogue; and Best Direction - Feature Film at the 67th National Film Awards 2021.[6][7]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film follows two fedayeens Hakim and Bilal, who get killed after committing a suicide bombing at the Gateway of India in Mumbai. They find themselves in a purgatory state, waiting to enter heaven. They are told that they will be rewarded with 72 virgins, known as the \"Houri\". However, as they wait, they begin to have doubts about the existence of the Hoorain and the afterlife. They also start to question the reasons why they were trapped in a deadly illusion of 72 virgins, and embark on a path of destruction, ultimately meeting a gruesome fate.\n\nCast[edit]\nSaru Maini as Meher\nPavan Malhotra as Militant Hakim Ali\nAamir Bashir as Militant Bilal Ahmed\nRasheed Naz as Maulvi, who discusses the concept of Houri\nBhavani Bashir Yasir as Maulvi\nNarottam Bain\nRelease[edit]\n72 Hoorain was released in English and 10 other Indian languages \u2013 Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu.[8][9] Official trailer was released on 28 June 2023.[10][11]\n\nCBFC rating[edit]\nThe filmmakers objected to CBFC's denial of certification to the trailer of this movie.[12] However, the Censor Board in a released press note said \"Misleading reports are being circulated in certain sections of media that a film and its trailer titled 'Bahattar Hoorain (72 Hoorain)' has been refused certification by Central Board of Film Certification. Contrary to the reports, CBFC states that the film 'Bahattar Hoorain (72 Hoorain)' was granted 'A' certification and the certificate was issued on 4-10-2019\".[13]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\n72 Hoorain hit screens on July 7, generating buzz but not significantly impacting ticketing on its opening day. It collected 0.35 crore rupees with the overall occupancy of 8.98%.[14] On Day 2, the film earned Rs 0.45 crore, reaching a total collection of Rs 0.80 crore, and it had a 11.60% occupancy in the Hindi belt.[15] On day 3, the film grossed Rs 1 crore, minted 47 lakh, and had a 12.35% occupancy in the Hindi box office.[16][17] On Day 4 it earned 25 Lakhs.[18]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nThe Outlook rated the film 4/5 and stated \"It is all the more necessary that audiences hardwired to entertainment also watch this film, for it exposes the nexus between religion and terrorism brilliantly, and brings the debate over religious fanaticism to the centrestage\".[19] Abhishek Srivastava of Times of India rated the film 3.5/5 and cited \"This thought-provoking film reiterates that extremism has no positives\".[20] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote \"Nothing controversial about this cautionary tale. Chauhan is razor-sharp in his focus and delivers a strong and timely message. It serves as a wake-up call\".[21]  Umesh Punwani of Koimoi rated the film 2/5 and said \"All said and done, this film winning a National Film Award in 2021 only goes on to show how there\u2019s a dearth of films made with good intent backed by equally strong story and screenplay.\"[22]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n50th International Film Festival of India\nUNESCO Gandhi Medal - Special Mention for Best Film on peace and inter-cultural dialogue\n67th National Film Awards\nBest Direction - Feature Film\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"72 Hoorain: Film Sparks Debate About The 72 Virgins Myth\".
