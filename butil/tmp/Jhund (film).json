It evokes laughter and makes you cry as well\".[20] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote \"With writing, direction and performance being its major strengths, JHUND makes for a superb entertainer\".[21] Stutee Ghosh of The Quint gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote \"Jhund is special for its determined eagerness to not please and to not treat Bachchan as the star. The veteran actor radiates warmth and a deep sense of humanity, making no concessions to commercial filmmaking\".[22] Sanjana Jadhav of Pinkvilla gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote \"The film keeps you invested in this team's journey through its heartbreaking climax, Manjule's social commentary, great acting and tugs right at your heart with its emotions\".[23]\nRachana Dubey of The Times Of India gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote \" There is a smattering of some colourful characters in the first half which adds to the energy and even includes humour.The pre-interval is high on energy but the pace slackens in the latter half\".[24] Tushar Joshi of India Today gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote \"Jhund is a rock-solid effort by director Nagraj Manjule, with Amitabh Bachchan towering over it all\".[25] Roktim Rajpal of Deccan Herald gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote \"Jhund has no scope for commercial elements like item songs and romance. The makers, fortunately, don't force these aspects into the narrative\".[26] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote \"Hands in pocket, eyes firmly focused on his mission, conviction inks his speech while his serene, sensitive, portrayal has a calming effect on the kids and Jhund\".[27] Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri of The Free Press Journal gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote \"One of the pleasures of the film is its unconventional structure \u2013 a heady, almost wilfully haphazard first half, followed by a leisurely paced and painstakingly detailed second one\".[28]\nThe Hans India gave the film a rating of 3/5 and wrote \"On the whole, the movie is worth watching as Amitabh Bachchan aka Vijay delivered his best and trains the slum boys with all his dedication!\".[29] Mayank Shekhar of Mid-Day gave the film a rating of 3/5.[30] Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2/5 and wrote \"This Nagraj Manjule film can never quite make up its mind whether it wants to treat Amitabh Bachchan's Borade as a hero, or focus the spotlight on the hardscrabble lives of the slum kids\".[31] Anna MM Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film a rating of 2/5 and wrote \"Jhund, despite its grand ambitions and good intentions, it fails to click as a cohesive, gripping whole\".[32]\nIn the trailer of the movie Jhund, there is a photo frame of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar which is being discussed on social media. Along with B. R. Ambedkar, Shivaji Maharaj, Shahu Maharaj and Mahatma Phule are also in this frame.[33][34][35] Director Nagraj Manjule said in an interview about the Jhund, \"The Jhund is the story of a group which is far from easy opportunities. It's a group that is on the path to success or far from where the opportunity arises. It's a group that is self-defeating, and that's the thing about it.\"[33][34]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nJhundSoundtrack album by Ajay\u2013AtulReleased19 February 2022[36]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength14:58LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesAjay\u2013Atul chronology\n\n\nTanhaji(2020)\n\nJhund(2022)\n\nRam Setu(2022)\nOfficial audioJhund - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Ajay\u2013Atul with lyrics  written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Ajay\u2013Atul (noted).[36]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Aaya Ye Jhund Hai\" (Lyrics by Ajay\u2013Atul)Ajay\u2013Atul, Jay, Mallhar, Sarja3:182.\"Lafda Zhala\"Ajay Gogavale3:553.\"Laat Maar\"Sid Sriram, Sourabh Abhyankar3:454.\"Baadal Se Dosti\"Sid Sriram4:00Total length:14:58\nBox office[edit]\nJhund is estimated to have collected a total of \u20b914.76 crore by the end of the third week in India.[4] In the end, the film stopped running with a collection of \u20b929.6 crores.[37]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Amitabh Bachchan starrer Jhund to release on March 4, 2022 in cinemas\".
