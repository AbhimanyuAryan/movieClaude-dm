Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nVikram Jaisingh aka Vicky is a cop who works in the Homicide Intervention Team HIT, and is a sharp person, who solves crucial cases with his ability to capture even the smallest of details, thus earning the trust of his senior Ajit Shekhawat. He is in love with Neha Mehta, his colleague and a forensic official.\nRohit is Vikram's close friend and colleague, who accompanies him in most of his cases. Vikram is constantly in an argument with Akshay, another officer, who crosses lines with Vikram. Vikram  suffers from PTSD due to his past trauma but refuses to take pills as he believes it slows down his abilities.\nMeanwhile, a girl named Preeti has her car break down on a highway. Officer Ibrahim Sheikh stops to help her, and call her father. When her father comes to pick her up, he sees that she has gone missing and Ibrahim says that she got into a blue car that he thought was his.\nWhen Preeti's parents approach Ibrahim demandingly, he remains firm and insults them. Being good friends with Preeti\u2019s father, Ajit decides to suspend Ibrahim. Meanwhile, Vikram decides to take a three-month break on account of his PTSD. After two months, Vikram gets a call that Neha is missing. He approaches Ajit to have the case assigned to himself, but is told that Akshay is dealing with the case.\nVikram asks Saxena, Neha\u2019s colleague about the cases Neha was investigating in the past two months. Vikram and Rohit connect Preeti's and Neha's missing cases and deduce that the same person must be involved in both cases. Vikram decides to investigate Preeti\u2019s disappearance instead.\nMeanwhile, Akshay labels Vikram a suspect in Neha\u2019s disappearance. Vikram\u2019s interrogates Preeti\u2019s boyfriend, Ajay and her friend, Sandhya about her whereabouts the previous night which leads him to a club. He finds out from Preeti\u2019s parents that she was adopted after her biological parents died in a plane crash. He also finds out that Preeti was good friends with a divorced neighbour Sheela.\nVikram and Rohit come to a conclusion that Sheela kidnapped Preeti after they see Sheela's blue car and a note forged by Sheela indicating the whereabouts of a corpse. Vikram and his team locate and dig up a body and find it to be decomposed and unrecognisable. Forensic analysis identifies it as Preeti and detects multiple DNA samples on it - Ajay, Preeti\u2019s father, Saraswati the head of Preeti\u2019s childhood orphanage and a fourth unknown DNA. Ibrahim meanwhile recalls that the blue car involved in Preeti\u2019s disappearance was a different one, thus making Sheela an unlikely suspect.\nA lady named Eesha arrives at the police station claiming that she was approached by a strange man in a car on the same highway, which prompts her to drive away quickly. Vikram checks the cameras at the toll booth on the highway and identifies a lorry passing through which matches a similar lorry noted during Preeti\u2019s disappearance and identifies the driver as Ibrahim\u2019s mechanic, Fahad.  Vikram, Ibrahim and Akshay find and apprehend Fahad, however Ibrahim is shot dead in the chase. Fahad takes them to the house where he received the money to kidnap Preeti, where Vikram finds Rohit and he shoots him dead, while Akshay finds Neha upstairs.\nDuring Rohit\u2019s funeral, his partner Sapna explains that she grew up with Preeti and they belonged to the same orphanage. Sapna had started developing feelings for Preeti since the age of 14 which resulted in Saraswati separating them.  When a couple came for adoption, they choose Preeti over Sapna which worsens her depression.\nSapna explains how her meeting Preeti at the club resulted in resurfacing of her pent up feelings. Sapna confesses her love for Preeti but is rebuffed. Sapna kidnaps Preeti with Fahad\u2019s help resulting in a fight that leads to Preeti's accidental death. Rohit tries to protect Sapna by burying her body. She further explains that when a note was found from Sheela's place indicating the whereabouts of the body Rohit replaced the body in the indicated location and plants the DNA evidences. Sapna explains the whole story and gets arrested.\nAfter the arrest Neha asks Vikram about his past and Vikram gets flashbacks of his hometown where a girl is set on fire infront of his eyes, but he does not reply to the question. \nLater when Neha and Vikram are together, Vikram almost gets shot, hinting at a possible sequel.\n\nCast[edit]\nRajkummar Rao as DCP Vikram Jaisingh IPS (Vicky), Neha's love interest\nSanya Malhotra as Dr. Neha Mehta, Vikram's love interest\nAkhil Iyer as Rohit Shukla, Vikram's colleague\nShilpa Shukla as Sheela\nDalip Tahil as Ajit Singh Shekhawat, Vikram's senior officer\nSanjay Narvekar as Shrikant Saxena\nMilind Gunaji as SI Ibrahim Sheikh\nHemraj Tiwari as Mohan Mathur\nJatin Goswami as Akshay\nRose Khan as Preeti Mathur\nRaviraj as Fahaad\nMadhur Arora as Anirudh\nDishita Sehgal as Young Preeti\nNuveksha as Sapna Shukla, Rohit's wife & Preeti's obsessed lover\nKirti Kapoor as Geetha\nKaran Mehta as Shiva\nNoyrika Bhatheja as Dr Ritika\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced on 12 September 2021 and wrapped up on 18 April 2022.[10][11]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nHit - The First CaseSoundtrack album by Mithoon and Manan BhardwajReleased26 July 2022[12]Recorded2021-2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength11:39LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesOfficial audioHit - The First Case - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Mithoon and Manan Bhardwaj while the lyrics are written by Sayeed Quadri and Manan Bhardwaj.[12] The film score is composed by John Stewart Eduri.
