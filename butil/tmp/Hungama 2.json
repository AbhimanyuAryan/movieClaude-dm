He also has four mischievous grandchildren. The twist in the story happens when Vani, Akash's college girlfriend comes to their home with a child named Gehna and claim the child's father is Akash. Akash refute her claim. Akash is betrothed to Bajaj's daughter, who is a friend of Jailor Govind.\nAkash takes the help of Anjali Tiwari, his co-worker to help him to hide things about Vani and the child to not let anyone know about it. But Anjali's husband Radhe Shyam Tiwari, a lawyer, is a suspicious minded man. He thinks that his wife is having an affair with some other man and finds clue leading to Akash. Tiwari overhear them talking about the child. Tiwari wrongly assumes that Akash is his wife's lover, and his wife is pregnant with Akash child.\nIn flashback, it is shown that Vani and Akash loved each other and the former left the latter suddenly without notice. They perform a DNA test, but due to their inability to read the medical lingo and result, they couldn't reach a conclusion. Akash, now desperate tries to get his nieces and nephews to prank Vani so she will leave. One of their pranks ends up injuring Gehna. Vani take the blame to save the children from punishment and in her act win own the children, and Vani becomes their nanny and friend.\nAkash engagement ceremony to Bajaj daughter is arrive and he tries to get Vani away from the ceremony without knowing that Bajaj invited her too, assuming she was the new teacher of Jailor grandchildren. Akash decides to change his bridal clothing mid-way. Anjali meet Akash mid-way with his bridal dress and changes in her car. Tiwari sees this, and assume his wife is having sex with Akash. Akash and Anjali come to the engagement ceremony but Anjali spot Vani. Vani is taken back home by Kapoor brother on fabricated account that Gehna was injured to the relief of Kapoor family. Akash quickly get engaged.\nTiwari confront Anjali and Akash without stating he knows about their \"apparent affair\" but Akash and Anjali assume he knows about Vani, so they shrug it off. Appalled by their behavior, he tries to kill Akash. His first attempt land himself in hospital. Akash hire his and Vaani's old cafeteria manager (who is an excellent forger) to act as her husband, the same day Tiwari make his second attempt to murder Akash. The cafeteria manager enters, but when asked he can't mention the child's name. Tiwari second attempt to kill Akash botchup cafeteria manager plan, destroying forged documents. A stranger meets Vani secretly and tell her to be present on the day of their own 'wedding'.\nOn Akash wedding reception, Tiwari get drunk and blurt out about his wife's \"apparent affair\" with Akash. In the confusion, truth about Vani and Gehna presence is revealed. The bride family call off the wedding. Akash gets drunk and try to force himself on Vani to tell the truth. To prevent this, Vani tells the truth and also tells that Gehna is neither hers nor Akash's but is her deceased sister and Akash's elder brother Aman's child. Vani later leaves the house with Gehna. Akash and family later decide that Vani and Akash should get married. They goes out to find Vani. They arrived too late to find Vani already married. Vani hands over Gehna to Aman. The Stranger interrupt Kapoor's and introduce himself as multi-talented Auteur, Director, Producer, Actor et el. The marriage ceremony is revealed to be part of a TV series, and director request Kapoor family to not disrupt his TV Series production, as Vani has given him enough trouble by her absence during shooting and he is on deadline.

That's how he tries to laugh. But this time he misses out completely and tries to make the audience laugh through the old formula.\"[16] Sudhanshu Maheshwari of Aaj Tak gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated, \"In such a situation, there was some buzz about Hungama 2, but in the absence of comedy, it remained just a noisy film, which would not harm anyone in.\"[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Shilpa Shetty's Hungama 2 to premiere on Disney+Hotstar on July 23\".
