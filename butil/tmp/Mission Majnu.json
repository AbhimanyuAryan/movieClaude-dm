Along the way, Aman falls in love with Nasreen Hussain, a blind girl and the two get married. In May 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test, due to which Pakistan secretly rushed to build its own nuclear weapon with the help of nuclear engineer Abdul Qadeer Khan.\nDuring the 1977 Indian general election campaign, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is appraised of the situation by RAW Chief R. N. Kao, and she directs him to find the location of the nuclear facility. Kao assigns the mission to Aman. Aman's handler, Sharma, informs him of his new mission named \"Mission Majnu\". Along the way, Aman meets two other RAW agents - Aslam Usmaniya and Raman Singh (under the pseudonym Maulvi Saab), who are stationed in Pakistan. Aman manages to gather information that Pakistan is indeed making a nuclear weapon. \nFollowing a general election in India, a new government is formed and its new leader and new Prime Minister Morarji Desai believes in building relationships through diplomacy and peaceful means, and is against any form of warfare including spying and intelligence gathering. Kao resigns to keep the operation in Pakistan going, and hidden from the Prime Minister. In the meantime, Israel is readying an attack on the Quetta military facility, wrongly believing it to be a nuclear weapon facility. Aman manages to locate the nuclear facility in Kahuta, but is unable to collect physical evidence. \nSharma discovers that Israel is going to attack Quetta in 48 hours. Aman goes back to Kahuta and collects hair of Army personnel working in the nuclear facility, which he surreptitiously sends to India, where it is tested and found to contain trace amounts of radiation, pointing to the presence of plutonium in Kahuta. Israel's attack on Quetta is averted. The matter is disclosed to Desai In light of new evidence, where he weighs in on Pakistan counterparts and Pakistan's inability to be trusted. ISI hunts down and kills covert RAW agents operating in Pakistan including Aman's colleagues Aslam and Raman. \nAman tries to escape to Dubai with a pregnant Nasreen, who is unaware that ISI agents are chasing them. Aman distracts ISI agents long enough to let Nasreen board an aeroplane and leave unhindered but is killed in the process. Nasreen lands in Dubai, where she meets Kao at the airport and reads a letter from Aman revealing his true identity.\n\nCast[edit]\nSidharth Malhotra as Amandeep Ajitpal Singh IPS (Aman) / Tariq Hussain, a RAW agent\nRashmika Mandanna as Nasreen Hussain/Nasreen Singh, Tariq/Aman\u2019s wife, who is blind and pregnant\nParmeet Sethi as R.N.

Rashmika Mandanna doesn\u2019t have much to do apart from trying to strike up some chemistry with Sid.\"[16]  Dhaval Roy of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote that the film is \"gripping in parts, but it\u2019s too convenient, which takes away from the narrative. While great, the action stretches in places and makes the movie seem formulaic\".[17] Dishya Sharma of News 18 rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Mission Majnu robs you of the thrills of a spy film. Watch it to see Sidharth and Rashmika in a different avatars\".[18]\nAnuj Kumar for The Hindu wrote \"There are interesting twists in the way Tariq ekes out information and how Nasreen could sense the truth by touch, but the execution makes it a tad too cloying for a thriller. Thankfully, the film is not overtly jingoistic and makes a clear distinction in the way Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai handled the tenuous relationship with Pakistan in the 1970s. At the same time, the writers place characters on both sides of the border who could see history beyond the divisive version that the politicians often present.\"[19] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the movie only 2 stars out of 5 and wrote \"Mission Majnu does not deliver a thrill a minute nor does it produce any exceptional degree of tension and suspense. Yet, parts of the film, especially in the second hour, do spring to life.\"[20] Shilajit Mitra for The New Indian Express rated 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Mission Majnu isn\u2019t as crudely jingoistic as something like Bhuj: The Pride of India.  The film also does not comment on the moral implications of nuclear proliferation; for that, you will have to see the pilot of Rocket Boys.\"[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Mission Majnu\".
