Performance of Sanjay Mishra is good while Vijay Raaz's character Raunak Raj Singh looked weak. The dialogue writing has a big hand in it.\nArchika Khurana of The Times of India[12] has given 2.5/5 stars stating that it is a family drama which is predictable and is a light-hearted to watch. It is based on the concept of 'some steal for need, some steal for greed,' with the farmhouse's inheritance serving as the focal point of the tale. Cinematography explores the property from all angles within the one farmhouse. Sanjay Mishra's makes JP character the most memorable and funny character while other roles were convincing. Overall it is unhurried social commentary on greed, class disparity, family disputes and romance appear to be a half-baked effort.\nRussel D'Silva of Bollywoodlife.com[13] has given 3/5 stars stating that Subhash Ghai comes back to form in the OTT space with this Amol Parashar and Barkha Singh thriller. The writer and the director together they have shown a pretty decent thriller. It has boasts some good twists and turns, with the climax especially standing out. The performances of Sanjay Mishra and Vijay Raaz rise above the script by their several notches. Overall it is a good watch for a neat, smart and snappy thriller.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"36 FarmHouse\". Times of India.
