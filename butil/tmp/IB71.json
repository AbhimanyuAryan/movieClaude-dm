With limited time and resources, IB agent Dev Jammwal tells his superior N.S. Avasti that the only plan to counter this threat is by implementing an airspace blockade, which blocked Indian airspace access to Pakistan and tried to show the violation of the Tashkent Agreement, which involves orchestrating the hijacking of an Indian plane by Kashmiri separatists and ensuring its landing in Pakistani territory. Initially dismissed as an implausible scheme by the government, they eventually recognize its potential and agree to execute the well-structured operation. Complications arise when the entire team of passengers, comprising intelligence officers, find themselves lodged in a Lahore hotel, where events unfold in an unforeseen circumanstances, thus deviating from the original plan.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nVidyut Jammwal as  Intelligence Bureau agent Dev Jammwal\nAnupam Kher as IB Chief N.

With a runtime of nearly two hours, the film maintains a screenplay that keeps the audience captivated throughout, ensuring there is never a dull moment.\"[12] Shaheen Irani of OTTplay gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"IB 71 is a good deal if you want an entertaining weekend watch. It is not the best film out there but for the most bits, it will leave you with a smile.\"[13]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times wrote \"Aditya Shastri's story is intriguing and holds a lot of potential to keep you hooked. What doesn't really work is the screenplay for which six people are credited -- Sankalp Reddy, Arjun Varma, E. Vasudeva Reddy, Arun Bhimavarapu, Gargee Singh and Abhimanyu Srivastava. For the longest time, they looked like disjoined and scattered pieces of a puzzle. Even when the story is picking pace, there is very little or no connect with how it unfolds for audiences to understand.\"[14] Vinamra Mathur of Firstpost gave 2.25 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Vidyut Jammwal gives his brawn a rest and lets his brain do the talking in this mildly engrossing but otherwise trite thriller.\"[15] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"IB71 leaves one with the nagging feeling that it could have been a much better film has the writing been a less of the by-the-numbers kind. But even as a middling spy drama, it is not without its moments.\"[16]\nZinia Bandyopadhyay of India Today gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Vidyut Jammwal's IB 71, which is based on true events, is an account of what happened during the Indo-Pak War of 1971. With a sluggish first half, followed by a thrilling second half, the film is a decent thriller.\"[17] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"This Vidyut Jammwal film IB71 claims to have been cobbled together from actual events, but the execution is both simplistic-comic-book and convoluted.\"[18]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAs of 29 June, the film collected \u20b929.19 crore (US$3.7\u00a0million).[19]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"IB71\".
