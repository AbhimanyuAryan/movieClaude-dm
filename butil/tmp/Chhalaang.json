He lives with his parents and his brother and spends most of his time hanging out and messing around with his teacher-buddy, Mr. Shukla. When Neelima Mehra arrives in Montu's school as a new computer teacher, Montu finds himself falling in love with her, and the two start to grow very close when she tells her nickname Neelu.\nTo his surprise, Montu finds out that the school hired a new PTI, Inder Mohan Singh, as the government required PTIs to have a physical education degree, which Montu didn't have. Begrudgingly, Montu accepts a role as Singh's assistant. Montu quickly realizes that Inder Mohan is a much better PT teacher  than him, and gets even more irked when Neelu starts spending more time with Inder Mohan. One day, Singh keeps Montu's brother, Bablu, pinned to the ground as a punishment for not paying attention. This leads to a fight between Montu and Singh, after which Montu quits his job at the school.\nMontu soon realizes that he cannot quit his job, and returns to the school to challenge Inder Mohan with a three sport competition: basketball, a 400m relay race, and kabaddi. Montu and Inder Mohan would coach the two separate groups of students participating. Whoever's team won the competition would stay as the PT teacher, while the other would have to leave, and Inder Mohan accepts the challenge. Montu foolishly lets Singh choose his team first in an attempt to impress Neelu by showing her his humility, and it backfires on him when he is left with a significantly weaker team.\nAs Montu starts to lose hope, Neelu comes to his side and helps him coach his team. She advises him to choose several girls for his team, which he does. Then, she helps him implement very unorthodox training regimes, such as running from guard dogs to increase speed, catching loose chickens to increase agility, and dribbling a basketball through a cow dung minefield to increase dribbling ability. Their efforts pay off, however, the children's parents start to revolt, saying that the competition is dragging their children's focus away from studies.  Montu's father with the help of Neelu  manage to get them back on board by using blackmail and threatening to re-open existing legal cases against them.\nAt the competition, Singh's team barely beat Montu's team in basketball, but Montu's team wins the competition with close victories in the 400m relay race and kabaddi. Inder Mohan accepts his defeat and congratulates Montu. Since, he realises that Singh is a much better coach than him, Montu proposes the idea of working together with Singh, as he has to learn a lot from him. Montu thanks the students and their parents for their trust and dedication. He then declares his love for Neelu, and she accepts his love proposal.\n\nCast[edit]\nMain[edit]\nRajkummar Rao as Mahender \"Montu\" Singh Hooda, a physical training instructor (PT teacher) (later becomes Neelu's husband)\nNushrat Bharucha as Neelima \"Neelu\" Hooda(nee Mehra), a computer teacher in the same school (later becomes Montu's wife)\nMohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Inder Mohan Singh, senior PTI in Montu's school\nSaurabh Shukla as Mr. Shukla, a former Hindi teacher and former principal of Montu's school\nRecurring[edit]\nIla Arun as Usha Gehlot, the principal of Montu's school\nSatish Kaushik as Kamlesh Singh Hooda, a retired lawyer and Montu's father\nJatin Sarna as Dimpy(chef in  a small snacks shop)\nNaman Jain as Babloo Singh Hooda, Montu's younger brother and student of Singh Sir\nGarima Kaur as Pinky Yadav\nBaljinder Kaur as Kamla Singh Hooda, Montu's mother\nSuparna Marwah as Sakshi S.
