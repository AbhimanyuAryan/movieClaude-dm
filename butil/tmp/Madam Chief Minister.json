The film stars Richa Chadda in the lead role. The film's official announcement was made by Chadda on February 12, 2020. The film was shot in Lucknow all through November and December 2019 in a start-to-finish 40-day schedule.[3][4] The film was theatrically released on January 2, 2021.[5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe movie Madam Chief Minister tells the story of Tara, a young woman from a lower caste who dreams of making a difference in her community. She joins a political party and works her way up through the ranks, eventually becoming a trusted aide to a senior leader. Despite her intelligence and hard work, Tara faces discrimination and prejudice from those around her, who view her caste as a barrier to success.\nDespite the challenges, Tara is undeterred, and when the opportunity arises, she seizes it with both hands. She stands for election in her constituency and wins, becoming the youngest Chief Minister in the state\u2019s history. However, her ascent to power is not without its challenges. She faces opposition from within her own party, as well as from other political parties and the media. There are also personal challenges, including her relationship with her boyfriend, who is a member of a higher caste.\nThe film explores the complexities and contradictions of Indian politics, including the pervasive influence of caste and the rampant corruption that is often a feature of political life. It also highlights the struggles of women in positions of power, who must navigate a male-dominated world and overcome entrenched biases and discrimination.[6]\n\nCast[edit]\nRicha Chadda as Chief Minister Tara Roopram: Danish's wife and Indramani's former girlfriend\nManav Kaul as Danish Rehman Khan: Tara's husband and Shashi's fianc\u00e9\nAkshay Oberoi as Indramani \"Indu\" Tripathi: Tara's former boyfriend and enemy who left her and used her when she was twice been pregnant by his child.\nSaurabh Shukla as Master Surajbhan\nSubhrajyoti Barat as Arvind Singh\nNikhil Vijay as Bablu\nBoloram Das as Sundar\nSangam Bahuguna as Khushwaha\nShreya Awasthi as Dr. Laxmi\nRaviza Chauhan as Shashi Rai / Shazia Ahmed, Danish's fianc\u00e9e\nSushil Shukla as Ansari\nVivek Yadav as Student 1\nRaj Vardhan Pandey as Killer\nMusic[edit]\nThe film's music was composed by Mangesh Dhakde, while lyrics written by Dushyant.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Chidi Chidi\"Swanand Kirkire2:15\nReception[edit]\nThe film received three stars out of five from Ronak Kotecha and he described the film as \"Madam Chief Minister gets our vote for being an entertaining political drama, set in the crime-infested corridors of power.\"[7]\n\nControversy[edit]\nThe movie\u2019s portrayal of the lead was criticized for not choosing a Dalit woman.
