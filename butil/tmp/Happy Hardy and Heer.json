It has its moments in the first half, while the second looks a bit dragged. With well- crafted romantic and intense moments, the film is a breezy love story.\"[14] The Economic Times gave it 3/5 and stated \"An amusing watch despite wafer-thin plot & weak screenplay\"[15]\nConversely, Nandini Ramnath from Scroll.in gave it 2/5 and stated \"There is barely anything new in the situations between Heer and the two men in love with her. Besides, both the leads look a bit too seasoned to be playing the love-at-first-sight game. Despite the high volume at which the dialogue is delivered \u2013 Reshammiya is subtlety itself compared to Sonia Mann \u2013 almost nothing resonates.\".[16] Moumita Bhattacharjee of Rediff.com gave the film 1 out of 5, calling it \"an extented music video\".[17]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe film collected \u20b95 million (US$63,000) on its opening day.[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Himesh Reshammiya's musical drama postponed, to now release on 31 January, 2020\".
