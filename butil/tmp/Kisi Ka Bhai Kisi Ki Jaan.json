Bhaijaan hates the idea of marriage as he feels that his wife might create disharmony among brothers. Though the  younger brothers pretend they don't want to get married, they all have secret lovers: Sukun, Muskaan and Chahat.\nThe brothers learn through Nadeem Chacha that Bhaijaan was in love with a girl named Bhagyalakshmi (fondly called Bhagya) and his brothers scheme to find her and reintroduce her to Bhaijaan to rekindle their relationship, but later finds that she is married now and has a son. The brothers conspire to find another woman named Bhagyalakshmi, because Bhaijaan was not in love with that girl so much as her name, where they finally meets another girl named Gundamaneni Bhagyalakshmi, a Telugu-speaking girl, and they finally make Bhagya and Bhaijaan fall for each other.\nBhaijaan clashes with a goon called Mahavir to take care of the colony. Mahavir tries to attack the colony, but Bhaijaan thwarts their attempts. While travelling in train to Bhagya's village in Telangana, Bhaijaan learns that Bhagya's brother Gundamaneni Balakrishna actually hates violence. Later, few goons enter into the train, but Bhaijaan bashes all the goons, Bhagya is shocked to see Bhaijaan whom she thought as a non-violent person, where she tries to leave for her village, but Bhaijaan convinces Bhagya and tells that he would never harbor violence again.\nBhaijaan and his brothers, along with Bhagya arrive at Bhagya's village with clean shaven look, where he and his brothers are welcomed and respected by her family. Bhaijaan is touched and impressed by their love, affection and hospitality. Bhaijaan discovers that a goon named Kodati Nageshwara wants to kill Balakrishna and his family, and had also joined Mahavir to take down Bhaijaan also. Learning this, Balakrishna seeks forgiveness from Nageshwara. It is revealed that Nageshwara's father Rameshwara was supplying narcotics at his coffee factory. Balakrishna, who was formerly a goon called 'Rowdy' Anna complained against Rameshwara, who later died after his reputation gets damaged. Nageshwara witnessed his father's death and swore revenge against Balakrishna, who later quit violence for Bhagya and his family, who are unaware of this.\nNageshwara attempts to attack Balakrishna and his family, but Bhaijaan thwarts his attempts and keeps them at a safe place. Later, Bhaijaan and his brothers, along with Balakrishna and his family arrive in Delhi for Bhaijaan and Bhagyalakshmi 's engagement, where Nageshwara and Mahavir attacks them, but Bhaijaan and a changed Balakrishna manage to kill Nageshwar.
