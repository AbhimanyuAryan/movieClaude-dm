The film is simply beautiful to behold.\"[21]\nRichard Propes of The Independent Critic gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5, saying, \"Easily one of my favorite films so far in 2023, Bhagwan Bharose is a reminder of how deeply the choices we make in our daily lives impact the children.\"[22]\nDhaval Roy of The Times of India gave it a 3.5 star and said that \"The film is thought-provoking without being preachy. What truly stands out about the movie is the strong message it delivers without letting go of the compelling story and narrative.\"[23]\nAnna M. M. Vetticad on an Instagram post writes \" As many moneyed Hindi films bow and scrape before the present establishment, Bhagwan Bharose is among the few that stand out for their courage, accompanied, thankfully, by quality.\"[24]\nSaumya Baijal from Outlook India writes in her article that, \"Ab Toh Sab Bhagwan Bharose is a timely reminder of a past that has shaped the hate of the present...A film and script like this is deeply aware of its gaze. A third person viewing that is strikingly personal, set in the languid village that not once favors any narrative.\"[25]\nFrom Mint Lounge, Udita Jhunjhunwala writes in her review of Bhagwan Bharose, \"Several ideas in this unhurried story...Director Shiladitya Bora's debut feature film extracts wonderful performances from its young cast\"[26]\n\u00c9lie Castiel from Kino Culture Montreal gave the film 4 stars and writes, \"This is independent Indian cinema at its most demanding respectability. Shiladitya Bora, definitely a name to remember. As we retain those, among others, from China, South Korea, Romania and even Iran.\"[27]\nBhagwan Bharose made it to The Times of India ETimes Top 20 Bollywood Movies of 2023.[28]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Bhagwan Bharose (12A)\".
