However, the film suffers due to mediocre music and excessive length.\"[43] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"It\u2019s brave of Sooraj Barjatya to take senior actors and weave an ode to friendship around them. He tells a tale which unfolds at its own pace and will surely appeal to your heart.\"[44] Himesh Mankad of Pinkvilla gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Uunchai is a well-made film. The emotions are relatable and the journey is motivating. Some trimming is needed in the second half, but it\u2019s a heart-warming watch.\"[45] Sonil Dedhia of News18 gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"The beauty of the film is that none of its pitfalls eventually matter. It wins you over with its innocence and simplicity. Uunchai is uneven but heartfelt. Despite its flaws, the emotions connect.\"[46]\nRenuka Vyavahare of Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"It\u2019s the performances that keep you interested despite a messy latter half. We wish the writing was stronger and did more justice to the fabulous cast.\"[47] Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"A bit fewer of several stretches towards the second half where the film meanders into more than one man-made crises, and this Uunchai would have been mission truly accomplished.\"[48] Shubham Kulkarni of Koimoi gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Uunchai is made with a lot of heart and nostalgia involved. Watch it with no expectations and with the thought that it is a filmmaker who wants to talk about love and its purity.\"[49]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times wrote, \"Uunchai is a heart-warming story without any intent of being preachy or trying to evoke extreme emotions. Beautiful characters and beautifully written story, makes Uunchai worth it.\"[50] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote, \"Uunchai tells a well-written, emotional story unhurriedly with relatable moments, making one chuckle and cry in equal parts. The length of the film takes away some of the bite.\"[51] Pratikshya Mishra of The Quint wrote, \"Uunchai has a strong emotional core but it lacks strength in brevity. The film\u2019s runtime could\u2019ve been cut down. When it comes to performances, every actor on screen, are masters of their craft.\"[52]\nAnindita Mukherjee of India Today gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Uunchai is all about feelings, love and emotions. One of the few things that could have been mended was the length of the film. We also wished to see more of Parineeti, Neena and Sarika.\"[53] Deepa Gahlot of Scroll wrote, \"For the armchair mountaineer, Uunchai, is a delight. If the over-long film is bearable, it because the actors make their characters endearing. Uunchai could have been entertaining if it wasn\u2019t so sanctimonious.\"[54] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Uunchai forcibly draws out our emotions by playing up the octogenarian actor's ordeal in a drama whose focus fluctuates between friendship, trekking, ageing, closures and making peace. The upshot is needless delay.\"[55] Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film 1 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Uunchai is a call to the elderly to embrace life and accept change. Ironically, the film itself is stuck in time.\"[56] Outlook India listed the film in its \"Five Content Driven Films of 2022\" List.[57]\n\nBox office[edit]\nUunchai competed with Rocket Gang, which was released on the same day and emerged victorious. The film collected Rs 1.81 crore at the domestic box office on its opening day.[58][59] On its second day, it showed 50% growth and collected Rs. 3.64 crore.[60] On the third day, it minted Rs. 5.05 crore.[61] The film grossed Rs. 15.46 crore, by the sixth day.[62] On its seventh day, it collected Rs. 1.56 crore. The total gross of first week is Rs. 17.02 crore.[63] In the film's second week, its gross collection decreased.[64]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2023\n\n68th Filmfare Awards\n\nBest Film\n\nRajshri Productions, Mahaveer Jain Films, Boundless Media\n\nNominated\n\n[65][66]\n\n\nBest Director\n\nSooraj Barjatya\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Actor\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nAnupam Kher\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Story\n\nSunil Gandhi\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Dialogue\n\nAbhishek Dixit\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Music Director\n\nAmit Trivedi\n\nNominated\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Uunchai Movie: Showtimes, Review, Songs, Trailer, Posters, News & More - TOI\".
