It has been directed by Ajay Bahl and jointly produced by Zee Studios, Outsiders Films and Echelon Productions.

She then tries to uncover the mystery behind the death while struggling with her own eyesight.[9][10]\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe principal photography of the film began in July 2021.[11][12][13] The film was wrapped up on 31 August 2021.[14][15]\nSince the protagonist of the film is visually impaired, Taapsee Pannu shot part of the film blindfolded to get the character right.[16]\n\nPromotions[edit]\nThe teaser of the movie was released on 20 November 2022. [17][18] As a part of the promotion, the movie was screened for a visually impaired audience.[19][20]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nBlurrSoundtrack album by Aditya Pushkarna, Rishi Dutta and Shivangi BhayanaReleased12 December 2022[21]Recorded2021\u20132022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength6:06LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyExternal audio Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThe music of the film is composed by Aditya Pushkarna, Rishi Dutta and Shivangi Bhayana while the lyrics are written by Srushti Tawade and Akshay The One.[21]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Nishaana\"Srushti TawadeAditya PushkarnaSrushti Tawade2:242.\"Blurr Title Track\" (Male Version)Akshay The OneRishi Dutta, Shivangi BhayanaMellow D, Shivangi Bhayana1:513.\"Blurr Title Track\" (Female Version)Akshay The OneRishi Dutta, Shivangi BhayanaDee MC, Shivangi Bhayana1:51Total length:6:06\nCritical reception[edit]\nAnna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost rated the film one out of five stars, and upset with the atmospherics, camera work and Taapsee Pannu\u2019s performance. She wrote, \"The larger message\u00a0Blurr\u00a0is aiming at gives it an interesting additional layer, even though it is not fully realised\".[22] Roktim Rajpal for India Today wrote \"Taapsee puts her worst foot forward and excels in a few inherently intense scenes. That said, one gets the feeling that she does not get enough scope to internalise the characters\".[23] Tanul Thakur of The Wire wrote, \"But Blurr resists the easy temptations, finding wrong ways to divulge personality, solidify tension, spring surprise\".[24] It  also earned negative review from Saibal Chatterjee who wrote,\"The film  loses sight of its primary purpose - delivering a thriller that makes the most of its resources while staying within its chosen parameters\".[25]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Taapsee Pannu unveils first-look poster of Blurr, maiden project of her production house\".
