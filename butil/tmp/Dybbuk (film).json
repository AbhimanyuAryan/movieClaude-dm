Only if there was some surprise element to this mundane horror drama.\"[8] Shubham Dwivedi of Pinkvilla gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote,\" Dybbuk is an unenthusiastic horror tale that mends in its own mediocrity without even making an effort to rise above it. The film does not evoke any emotion out of a viewer.\"[9] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 and said,\"Based on the Malayalam film Ezra, this Emraan Hashmi-Nikita Dutt-starrer plays strictly by the numbers.\"[10]\nTatsam Mukherjee, Author at Firstpost gave a rating of 1/5 and wrote, \" Dybbuk, a Hindi remake of the Malayalam film Ezra, is riddled with amateurish 'twists' and hasty resolutions.\"[11] Roktim Rajpal of Deccan Herald gave a rating of 2.5/5 and stated,\"Like all remakes, Dybbuk caters to those who haven't seen the original version.\"[12] Bollywood Hungama gave 2 stars and wrote,\" Dybbuk attempts to be an unconventional horror film but the not-so-scary second half and lengthy runtime spoil the show.\"[13] Anuj Kumar from The Hindu website wrote,\"The sincerity of filmmaker Jay K in addressing the science vs. logic bit is palpable, but the predictable storyline and cliched backstory make it a long wait till the climactic twist.\"[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Emraan Hashmi All Set to Star in the Hindi Remake of Malayalam Horror Film 'Ezra'\".
