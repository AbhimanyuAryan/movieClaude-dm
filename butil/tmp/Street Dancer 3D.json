Entertainment. The film stars Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhu Deva along with Nora Fatehi. The music was composed by Sachin\u2013Jigar, Tanishk Bagchi, Badshah, Guru Randhawa, Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner of T-Series.\nBased in London, Street Dancer 3D explores the conflict between an Indian dance team and a rival Pakistani dance team, whose members try to prove themselves as better until they take part in Ground Zero, one of the biggest dance competitions, for different wills; under various circumstances and harsh memories, they come together to win the competition.\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ABCD 2 (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer.[4] Filming commenced in February 2019 in Punjab, later moved to London and was wrapped up in July 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nSahej Singh Narula (Varun Dhawan) becomes the leader of Street Dancer, a London-based Indian hip-hop group, after his brother Inder, the former leader, injures his knee in a dance competition called Ground Zero. Two years after Inder\u2019s injury, Sahej purchases a dance studio, the source of funding for which is hidden. Street Dancer is challenged by the Rule Breakers, a rival Pakistani hip-hop group led by Inayat Naazi (Shraddha Kapoor). Inayat hides her hip-hop lifestyle from her conservative Muslim family. Street Dancer loses to the Rule Breakers because of their overused style. The rival teams watch an India vs Pakistan cricket match at a restaurant owned by Ram Prasad (Prabhu Deva). Rising tensions result in a food fight, that (in order to not be caught by the police) the two main characters pretended they were in love. Sahej asks his girlfriend Mia to coach Street Dancer, as she is a dancer for the Royals, a British dance team that is reigning champion of the Ground Zero competition. Street Dancer and the Rule Breakers watch the India vs Pakistan final match at Ram\u2019s restaurant. Tensions escalate into a dance battle, which the improved Street Dancer wins. \nAfter the dance battle, Inayat discovers that Ram feeds leftover food from his restaurant to homeless illegal immigrants. Ram shows Inayat how the homeless of different backgrounds fight together to survive while the privileged dance teams fight against each other over nationality, wasting food in the process. It is revealed that while attending a cousin\u2019s wedding in India, Sahej was pressured to illegally bring a group of dhol players to England, the tipping point being the dhol players\u2019 shady agent Chhabra paying Sahej 4 million rupees, which Sahej used to buy Street Dancer\u2019s studio. Inayat wants the Rule Breakers to win Ground Zero for the 100,000 pound grand prize to pay for the homeless immigrants to get back to their home countries. Sahej wants to win Ground Zero for Inder. Ram states that if Street Dancer and the Rule Breakers were to team up, they would be unstoppable, but the teams refuse. After a dance battle at a club, Sahej and three members of Street Dancer, Sushi, D and Poddy are recruited into the Royals. At Ram\u2019s restaurant, an increasingly arrogant Sahej boasts to the Rule Breakers that he is unbeatable as a Royal. To this, Ram reveals that he is a master of dance and is coaching the Rule Breakers. \nAfter the first round of Ground Zero, Sahej runs into Amrinder, one of the dhol players he helped bring to England. Amrinder reveals his group was conned by Chhabra and are now struggling as homeless illegal immigrants, unable to return to India. He begs Sahej for help, but Sahej denies responsibility and ditches him. After the Royals\u2019 semi final battle, the team encounters the homeless dhol players on the street and disrespects them. Sahej finally accepts the consequences of his actions and sees how Inayat\u2019s efforts can help the dhol players he wronged. When the Rule Breakers come close to elimination, Sahej succumbs to his guilt and rebels against the Royals. Street Dancer joins the Rule Breakers to advance to the finals against the Royals. Inayat\u2019s conservative family discovers that she is a dancer and forbids her from the competition. However, Sahej convinces them that although Inayat\u2019s hip-hop lifestyle is incompatible with her religious customs, the good she brings to the world through her dancing is godserving and morally righteous. Her father allows her to dance in the finals, and the two teams compete under the name Street Dancer. During Street Dancer's performance, a member of the Royals disconnects their music. Street Dancer must almost forfeit to the Royals, however, the dhol players perform live music. However, Marc finds out that one of his team members took out the music and he asks his teammate to put the music back. Street Dancer wins the competition, earning the respect of the Royals. Using the prize money, they send homeless illegal immigrants, including the dhol players, back home, while Sahej and Inayat begin a relationship.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nPrabhu Deva as Ram Prasad a.k.a.
