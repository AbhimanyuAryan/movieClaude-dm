They run the stores with the help of Pandit, but the store is in shambles and the Fukras are earning by doing small jobs. Bholi Punjaban wants to stand in election for Water Section of Delhi and is backed by water supplier Dhingra, a corrupt businessman who makes money on the plight of poor people, and also owns a waterpark. Bholi cleans a public toilet to gain the attention of poor people, but a small deed by Choocha at the same spot, wins the people's hearts.\nIn one of her rallies, Bholi mentions eradication of water mafia in Delhi and free water for public, but Dhingra wants to control the entire water facilitation of Delhi and is backing Bholi for the same reason. Hunny, Pandit, and Lali decide to contest Choocha in the election as he is gaining public attention due to his antics. However, Choocha blurts out the plan to Bholi, who decides a counter plan to send Choocha and the Fukras to South Africa with her two bodyguards, Eddie and Bobby, to Shinda's Diamond mine. Choocha is offered money to use his Deja-Chu on the mine to find diamonds in the mine. Shinda's niece falls in love with Choocha in South Africa. 10 days later, Choocha does not get Deja-Chu, where Hunny realise Bholi's plan and decides to escape from South Africa.\nChoocha has a Deja-Chu at the moment and decides to dig at the spot, where he finds a diamond and is caught by Shinda's niece. By mistake, Choocha ingests the diamond and all four of them escape to a ridden amusement park. While spending the night there, Choocha and Hunny face a dangerous electric shock which dries up their entire body of water. Pandit Ji and Lali somehow revive them with water and Choocha urinates in a small bowl. Hunny is sweating profusely and Pandit cleans him up in the same bowl. Lali discards the bowl's contents in a pit. When Pandit lights a cigarette and throws the matchstick in the pit, it combusts creating a small flame. The next morning, they once again try creating the same mixture and it combusts again, meaning hydrogen from Hunny's sweat and carbon from Choocha's diamond ingested urine are creating a fuel-like substance.\nThey return to India and Choocha now once again participates in the election by promising cheap fuel to everyone. They are winning public's support much to Bholi's chagrin. Bholi devises a plan to fake her marriage with Bobby in Choocha's presence, bt Choocha blurts out his new god given gift to Bholi. Bholi marries Choocha instead and sends the pictures of their marriage to the Fukras. Choocha gets kidnapped soon after. Shinda also comes to India to retrieve his diamond and marry his niece to Choocha, where he gets a few gangsters to do the work. The next day, Hunny and others confront Bholi who puts forward a deal wherein they get equal partnership and profits and Bholi backs out of the election. Dhingra notices something fishy and has Choocha kidnapped, but Bholi saves him by a call to Dhingra.\nDhingra wants proof of the thing and gets all the Fukras together and sees video of same. He stops the water supply to entire Delhi and decides to give water in abundance to produce cheap fuel. This water shortage leads to a fight between Dhingra's men and the poor people which leads to Dhingra's men driving a truck over a poor school student. This news is covered sensationally and it leads to the Fukras deciding to move against Dhingra. Eddie is also moved by the incident and decides to support the Fukras and makes sure Bobby supports them too. They go against Dhingra, who captures them all. He suspends Pandit and Lali over a crocodile infested water pool, Hunny in a knight suit so he sweats profusely and Bholi and Choocha on ice blocks, to make Choocha urinate.\nIt is revealed that when Eddie's heart had changed, he helped the Fukras record a video revealing Dhingra's real plan and their location of capture. The crowd breaks through the water park and stomp over Dhingra and saves the rest of the Fukras. Shinda's niece confesses her one sided love for Choocha. Hunny and Pandit Ji still save a dying Dhingra by getting water for him. Choocha wins the election by a landslide, but his marriage with Bholi is not accepted at Choocha's home. The Fuel Minister of Bangalore calls the Fukras to Bangalore, but when they arrive, Choocha's pee and Hunny's sweat do not turn into petrol; Choocha hadn't taken a dump since South Africa and did so in the flight to Bangalore, upon his excretion, Zafar, who is in Goa, finds the diamond which dropped from the Fukras' flight. The film ends with Choocha getting chased by Bholi, with Pandit following behind.\n\nCast[edit]\nPulkit Samrat as Vikas \"Hunny\" Gulati\nVarun Sharma as Dilip \"Choochaa\" Singh\nManjot Singh as Lali Halwai\nRicha Chadha as Bholi Punjaban / Phool Kumari Sehgal\nPankaj Tripathi as Narayan Pandit \"Panditji\"\nManu Rishi Chadha as Shunda Singh Ahluwalia\nAli Fazal in a cameo appearance as Zafar Khan[8]\nAmit Dhawan as Dhingra [9]\nPurnendu Bhattacharya as CM Brijmohan\nGeeta Agrawal Sharma as Prakash Kaur, Shunda's wife\nNatasha Kamwenje as Mombasa, Shunda's niece\nMichael Obodike as Eddie, Bholi's henchman\nLucas Ogunro as Bobby, Bholi's henchman\nShubham Dongare as Bittu\nLekha Prajapati as Air Hostess\nTwarita Nagar in a special appearance in the song \"Ve Fukrey\"\nJuhi Bhatt in a special appearance in the song \"Ve Fukrey\"\nSanchi Rai in a special appearance in the song \"Ve Fukrey\"\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography commenced in March 2022.[10] Production wrapped in June 2022.[11]\n\nMusic[edit]\nFukrey 3Soundtrack album by Tanishk Bagchi, Sumeet Bellary and Abhishek NailwalReleased27 September 2023[12]Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength12:57LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioFukrey 3 - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Tanishk Bagchi, Sumeet Bellary and Abhishek Nailwal.
