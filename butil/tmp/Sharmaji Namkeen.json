It stars Rishi Kapoor (in his final film appearance) and Paresh Rawal in the title role, with Juhi Chawla, Satish Kaushik, Sheeba Chaddha, Isha Talwar, Suhail Nayyar and Taaruk Raina in supporting roles. \nThe film began production in January 2020 but filming was halted due to Rishi Kapoor's death on 30 April 2020. Paresh Rawal was cast to finish Kapoor's remaining scenes, marking this as the first instance in Hindi cinematic history of two actors playing the same character simultaneously.\nThe film premiered on Amazon Prime Video on 31 March 2022.[1][2][3][4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nBrij Gopal Sharma a.k.a. Sharmaji, a middle-class widower, is asked to retire by his company Madhuban Home Appliances at the age of 58, much to his annoyance. A healthy and lively man, he lives with his sons Sandeep \"Rinku\" Sharma and Vinayak \"Vincy\" Sharma at his rather small home in Subhash Nagar, West Delhi. Rinku is in a relationship with his colleague Urmi Kaul, and the two of them plan on buying a flat in Gurgaon after they get married. Vincy is a final year B.Com student who is passionate about dance. Sharmaji is averse to the idea of moving away from his home of the past many years, causing Rinku to hide the fact that he is finalizing his apartment deal.\nSeeking to overcome boredom, Sharmaji decides to venture into other hobbies, and also applies for a few jobs. After looking into Zumba classes, property brokerage, and various other small jobs, he reluctantly agrees, at the suggestion of his childhood friend Chaddha, to cook for kitty parties after an acquaintance of the latter, Manju Gulati, thanks him for a cooking job done well. During a second such party, he befriends Veena Manchanda, a boutique owner whose husband died in a car crash three years ago. He is warmly welcomed by the members of the kitty and soon caters to many occasions. At one such party, he meets Veena's dear friend Robbie Sachdeva, a politician, and he cooks for a religious meet at the latter's place.\nOn his birthday, Rinku invites their extended family over, and someone comes across a video of Sharmaji dancing at a kitty party. Rinku and Vincy are humiliated and furious at this and an argument ensues between the three of them, wherein Vincy reveals that Rinku is moving out and Rinku blurts out that Vincy failed his exams. Sharmaji is distraught at this but nevertheless, continues to follow his passion.\nVeena and Sharmaji bond over the parties, and soon become close friends. One day, they overhear Rinku fighting with the flat builder Jain. He lies to them that all is well. That night, they meet Urmi's parents, where Sharmaji finds out that Urmi's father knows more about the flat than he does. On the way back, he confronts Rinku, who confesses that Jain is delaying the possession of the flat and that he paid 15 lakh rupees (\u20b9 1,500,000) as token money (deposit). Sharmaji is devastated to learn that his son spent so much money without even informing him, and decides to stop his catering hobby to focus more on things at home.\nRinku is informed at a municipal office that Jain has constructed the flats on illegal land, and is advised to get his token money back and get out of the deal. When Jain refuses to answer his calls, Rinku attacks the security guards at Jain's office and is arrested. Sharmaji is at a final kitty party when he gets the call from the station that his son has been arrested. He rushes to the police station with the ladies, and a comical turn of events ensues. He is put behind bars along with his son, while the ladies are made to sit in a corner. Unbeknownst to the constable, Sharmaji has a phone inside the cell. Veena communicates to Sharmaji, using hand signals, to call Robbie who uses his power as the Mayor of West Delhi to release them; while Sharmaji learns that Robbie is Veena's brother-in-law, Robbie asks Rinku to meet Jain later for retrieving his money.\nWhile being driven back home, Rinku realizes his mistake and apologizes to his father for not being a good son. Sharmaji accepts his apology, and they all go back home.\n\nCast[edit]\nRishi Kapoor as Brij Gopal Sharma a.k.a.
