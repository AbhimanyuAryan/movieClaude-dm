The film stars Urvashi Rautela in the lead role, with Gautam Gulati, Archana Puran Singh, Chaitanya Kanhai and Rumana Molla playing supporting roles. The film is a family comedy that explores relationship between youngsters and their families. The film was scheduled for theatrical release in India and received negative reviews,[2][3] but has moved to release on 16 July 2020 through ZEE5 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1]\n\n\nCast[edit]\nUrvashi Rautela as Bhanupriya Awasthi (Bhanu)\nGautam Gulati as Shartiya / Abhimanyu\nArchana Puran Singh as Madhu Awasthi, Bhanupriya's mother\nRumana Molla as Rukul Singh\nRajiv Gupta as Vijay Awasthi, Bhanupriya's father\nBrijendra Kala as Police Inspector\nNiki Aneja Walia as Moon\nNatasha Suri as Sonali\nSumit Gulati as Rajiv\nChaitanya Kanhai as Alex\nPranav Verma as Jhanda\nAshutosh Senwal as Chukiya\nAmrit Arora as Pungi\nAyush Gupta as Computer Geek\nDelnaaz Irani as Tarot Card Reader\nShiv Kumar as Shartiya's Father\nDimple Chauhan as Shartiya's Mother\nKamlesh Kumar Mishra as Pandit\nVikas Verma as Irfan\nRelease[edit]\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was not released theatrically and was streamed on ZEE5 worldwide on 16 July 2020.[1]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nVirgin BhanupriyaSoundtrack album by Chirrantan Bhatt, Ramji Gulati, Amjad Nadeem Aamir and Saurabh-VaibhavReleased27 July 2020[4]Recorded2019GenreFeature film soundtrackLength19:10LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyExternal audio Official Audio Jukebox on YouTube\nThe film's music was composed by Chirrantan Bhatt, Ramji Gulati, Amjad Nadeem Aamir and Saurabh-Vaibhav while lyrics written by Manoj Yadav, Kumaar, Alokik Rahi, Amjad Nadeem, Ajay Lohan and Sumit Sharma.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Dil Apni Haddon Se\"Manoj YadavChirrantan BhattJyotica Tangri4:092.\"Kangna Vilayati\"KumaarRamji GulatiJyotica Tangri3:003.\"Beat Pe Thumka\"Alokik Rahi, Amjad NadeemAmjad Nadeem AamirJyotica Tangri3:214.\"Virgin Bhanupriya - Title Track\"Ajay LohanSaurabh-VaibhavDev Negi2:425.\"Dil Apni Haddon Se\" (Yasser Version)Manoj YadavChirrantan BhattYasser Desai3:306.\"Kadi Hoon Karke\"Ajay Lohan, Sumit SharmaSaurabh-VaibhavSheetal Gupta2:28Total length:19:10\nCritical reception[edit]\nPallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India rated the film 2/5, calling it \"another run-of-the-mill tale on sexual liberation\".[5] Devasheesh Pandey of News18 gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5, writing \u2033Urvashi Rautela's 'Virgin Bhanupriya' is not a disguised sex comedy and functions more as a family drama. It brings forth how the society sees sexual curiosity as something scandalous.\u2033[6] Bollywood Hungama gave the film 2 stars out of 5, writing \u2033VIRGIN BHANUPRIYA is 1 hour 50 minutes long and starts off with the central plot without wasting any time. Some of the situations in the film are funny, on paper, but doesn't translate the same way on screen. The track of Rajiv is mediocre. Shartiya's entry is heroic and one expects the film to get better. Sadly, that doesn't really happen. The film should have been high on humour and also emotional moments and barring a joke or two, nothing really works. The climax is haphazard and even though the twist is kind of unexpected, the impact is not made.\u2033[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Virgin Bhanupriya\". Bollywood Hungama. 16 July 2020.
