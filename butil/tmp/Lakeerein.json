The film, set in Lucknow and Ayodhya, delves into Kavya's emotional journey and its impact on those around her, like her friend Anita and maid Naseema, who've also suffered similarly. Advocate Geeta Bishwas,[4] played by Bidita Bag, challenges the legal differentiation between married and unmarried women when recognizing rape, sparking a vital conversation about societal values and justice.[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ FC, Team (10 October 2023). \"Ashutosh Rana and Tia Bajpai's Next is Lakeerein\". www.filmcompanion.in.
