Being a woman, she faces several challenges and prejudices from the male-dominated society. However, she stands up against all odds and fights for the betterment of her village.\n\nCast[edit]\nSeema Biswas as Parvati\nAjay Chourey as Ram Singh\nJyoti Dubey as Gauri\nAriana Sajnani as Ana\nBhagwan Tiwari as Bhaiiya ji\nReception[edit]\nShubhra Gupta, writing for the Indian Express, remarked, \"A film that dares to accommodate these lines is a rarity. However, they become overshadowed by the mundane storytelling. The subplot involving the 'madam sarpanch,' who outsmarts her thuggish husband (Bhagwan Tiwari), relegates the attempted subversion to a secondary role. The criticisms aimed at 'TV anchors who spread hate' and corrupt politicians who are skilled deceivers end up being ineffective. It's important to note that good intentions don't always translate into good films.\"[8] She has given 1.5 rating out of 5.\nDhaval Roy, reviewing for the Times of India, has given a rating of 2.5 out of 5.[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Meet Odisha's Arati Devi Who Inspired Bollywood Movie 'Sir Madam Sarpanch' & Coined 'Beti Padhao'\". odishabytes. 16 April 2023.\n\n^ \"Sir Madam Sarpanch - Official Teaser\".
