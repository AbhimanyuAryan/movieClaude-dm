The movie is inspired by the real story of Sagarika Chakraborty and her husband, an Indian couple living in Norway whose children were taken away by the Norwegian Child Welfare Services, who had objections against parenting habits that are considered typical in Indian culture.[11][12]\nThe film is based on the story of a real-life immigrant mother\u2019s battle against the Norwegian law-enforcing authorities to gain custody of her children.[13]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began in August 2021.[14] The first production schedule took place in Estonia and was completed by 21 September 2021.[15] The film was wrapped up on 18 October 2021.[16][17]\n\nRelease[edit]\nTheatrical[edit]\nThe film was theatrically released on 17 March 2023.[18]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMrs Chatterjee Vs NorwaySoundtrack album by Amit TrivediReleased2 March 2023[19]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength10:50LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyAmit Trivedi chronology\n\n\nUunchai(2022)\n\nMrs Chatterjee Vs Norway(2023)\n\nGhoomer(2023)\nOfficial audioMrs Chatterjee Vs Norway - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Amit Trivedi.

It is not a light watch, but something that is compelling and emotional. However, by the end, the film feels a bit stretched.\"[21] Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 stars out of five and said, \"It is a hard-hitting drama and is laced with the career-best performance of Rani Mukerji.\"[22] Monika Rawal of Hindustan Times said, \"It remains a true-to-heart account of a gut-wreching story of a mother, but there are so many layers you wish the director dug deeper and explored with the main character.\"[23]\nSukanya Verma of Rediff.com said, \"Instead of feeling her desperation, despair or extreme acts stemming from a mother's primal need to protect her brood, what comes through is hollow theatrics.\"[24] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 1.5 stars out of five and said, \"It is an overheated affair that sucks the air out of an intrinsically moving story that deserved infinitely better.\"[25] Udita Jhunjhunwala from Mint Lounge said, \"It was hard to root for the Chatterjees in a film that has greater recall as a tear-soaked Bollywood drama than a recreation of a real life human-interest story.\"[26]\n\nBox office[edit]\nThe film collected \u20b93.22 crore on its opening day with releasing on 500 screens.[27] The collections saw a 77.95% jump on the second day with the film collecting \u20b94.55 crore. On the third day it earned \u20b94.91 crore taking its first weekend collection to \u20b912.68 crore. As of 20 April 2023, the film has grossed \u20b936.53 crore worldwide with grossing 745K Norwegian Krones over the weekend, the film has become the highest grossing Bollywood film in Norway.[28] It later became the most-watched South Asian film in Norway with 8356 admits.[29]\n\nResponse from Norwegian authorities[edit]\nNorway Embassy in India issued a statement before the release of film:\n\nThere has been a lot of attention towards the film, Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway.\nThe film is a work of fiction, even though it is based on an actual case. The case being referred to was resolved a decade ago in cooperation with Indian authorities and with the agreement of all parties involved. To protect the children and the right to privacy the government can not comment on specific cases due to strict confidentiality regulations. However, some general facts must be set right;\n\nChildren will never be taken away from their families based on cultural differences described. Eating with their hands or having children sleeping in bed with their parents are not considered practices harmful to children and are not uncommon in Norway, irrespective of cultural background.\nChild welfare is not driven by profit. The alleged claim that \u2018the more children put into the foster system, the more money they make\u2019 is completely false. Alternative care is a matter of responsibility, and not a money making entity.\nThe reason for placing children in alternative care is if they are subject to neglect, violence or other forms of abuse.\u2014\u200aRoyal Norwegian Embassy, New Delhi\nThey further wrote that they \u2033sympathize with the affected families, particularly the children. For those involved, there is no denying that the such experiences are difficult.\u2033[30]\nFollowing the release of the film, Norwegian Ambassador Hans Jacob Frydenlund criticized the film, stating that \"it incorrectly depicts Norway\u2019s belief in family life and our respect for different cultures.\"[31] This was countered by Sagarika Chakraborty who condemned the statements made by him adding, \"When the whole world can see the bond between me and my kids, the Norwegian Government continues to spread lies about her without even knowing her story\". She also said that she's getting a lot of love from all over the world and people want to come and meet her after the film. Sagarika said that the Indian Government has helped her immensely.[32] In an op-ed piece in the Indian Express, she specifically referred to the issues surrounding children sharing the bed and being fed.[33]\nJone Skjelbred, Municipal Manager for children, young people and families in Stavanger municipality said that \u2033they do not want to comment on the case because none of the people who have worked on this case work for them anymore. As a result, they do not have enough knowledge of the matter.\u2033 Gunnar Toresen, who was head of child protection in Stavanger municipality in 2011, said \u2033This is not the story as it happened, but the film probably reflects the violent feelings that the case triggered in the family and in India.\u2033[34]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n28 January 2024\n\nBest Actress\n\nRani Mukerji\n\nNominated\n\n[35]\n\n\nBest Actress (Critics)\n\nWon\n\n\nZee Cine Awards\n\n10 March 2024\n\nZee Cine Award for Best Actor \u2013 Female\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nZee Cine Critics Award for Best Actor \u2013 Female\n\nWon\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway\".
