She has been a top student throughout her life and passes her 10th exams with flying colours, prompting the topmost school in India to offer her a full scholarship for the next two years. She becomes the top student there too, her only competition being another student from the underprivileged class, Aakash, who too has been granted the self-same scholarship. Their joy is complete when the principal of the school, informs them that the school has chosen them to sit in the prestigious Oxford University entrance test, which will help them gain a full scholarship if selected.\nNiyati makes friends with Chhavi, who is super rich but weak in studies. Chhavi asks her to help out during the exams, and Niyati at first does it out of friendship and later starts doing it for the money. But the money isn\u2019t for herself, rather it\u2019s sent as donations for her orphanage. There\u2019s a worldwide entrance exam, the basis of which students can gain admission into a top college abroad. The rich kids pay an obnoxious amount of money to both Niyati and Aakash to help them crack it. And the two brilliant students utilise their genius to come up with the perfect plan to achieve that goal. Both are in danger of losing their innocence, however. Whether they stay true to the right path or lose themselves in the blind pursuit of lucre forms the crux of the film .\n\nCast[edit]\nAlizeh Agnihotri as Niyati Singh\nRonit Roy as Ishrat Kada\nSahil Mehta as Aakash\nZeyn Shaw as Prateek\nPrasanna Bisht as Chhavi\nArbaaz Khan as Chavi's father\nJuhi Babbar as Zoya\nShilpa Shukla as Vedita Matthew\nIshan Jack as Student\nMusic[edit]\nFarreySoundtrack album by Sachin\u2013JigarReleased20 November 2023[7]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength11:44LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanySachin\u2013Jigar chronology\n\n\nAankh Micholi(2023)\n\nFarrey(2023)\n\nMurder Mubarak(2024)\nOfficial audioFarrey - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music for the film composed by Sachin\u2013Jigar.

It was released on 1000 screens domestically.[8][9]\n\nHome media[edit]\nFarrey was released on the streaming platform ZEE5 on April 5.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 11 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10.[11]\nIt received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Alizeh\u2019s performance. \nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV scored the film at 2.5 out of 5 stars and says \"Alizeh is Farrey's brightest point, by far. She plays a big part and gives it credit. Sahil Mehta, Prasanna Bisht, and Zeyn Shaw, the other three young performers in the ensemble, have somewhat less nuanced roles to portray, but they nonetheless give the movie a steady energy.\".[12] Tushar Joshi of India Today This ensemble of young stars aces the thrill mark sheet\".[13] Vinamra Mathur  of Firstpost labelled the film \"Alizeh Agnihotri, Salman Khan's niece, debuts with assurance in a gripping thriller.\".[14]\nAlaka Sahani of The Indian Express gave 3 stars out of 5 and praised Agnihotri's performance and said \"it is Agnihotri, whose intelligence as well as ambition is at the centre of Farrey, holds the story together and keeps her character relatable. She also deftly portrays Niyati\u2019s transitions at different stages of the movie.\"[15]\nPrannay Pathak of Hindustan Times said \"Alizeh Agnihotri, Salman Khan's niece, makes a strong cinematic debut in Soumendra Padhi's latest feature\"[16]\nPratikshya Mishra of The Quint gave 3 stars out of 5 and said \"Alizeh stands out from the rest of the cast, in part because her character is the most developed and in part because of her on-screen persona, which helps the audience identify with the character.\"[17]\n\nAccloades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nRecipient\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2024\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\nBest Female Debut\n\nAlizeh Agnihotri\n\nWon\n\n[18][19]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Farrey Box Office\".
