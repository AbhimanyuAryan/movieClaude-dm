The official trailer was release 15 days prior of its release with positive response.[7][8]\nThe film will have its theatrical release on 19 May 2023.[3]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nDhaval Roy of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 , stating that the film tells the meaning of live, life, loss and eventual healing.[9] Grace Cycril of India Today gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 , stating that the film is like a group therapy session.[10]\nMona of The tribune  gave the film 3* and highlighted the contribution made by actors other than te lead. It mentioned..\nNimisha Nair as Riya is not just the catalyst in this story but has her own arc that she beautifully delivers. In scenes where she accuses her sister of abandoning her to the one where she accepts the truth or where she covers up for Iravati when her husband, Umesh (Umesh Kamat), shows up unannounced, she leaves a mark. Even the actors who appear for a short while leave an imprint, whether it is Rajiv Aneja as the author of \u2018Jigri\u2019, Dheer Charan Srivastav as bookseller Iqbal or Umesh as a busy husband who has forgotten to value family life.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"India Box Office: '8AM Metro' Earns 0.3 Million, 'IB71' Improves In Week 2\".
