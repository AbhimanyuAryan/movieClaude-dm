Known for critically acclaimed roles in Chitchor and Gopal Krishna  in Hindi and Malayalam cinema with films like Madanolsavam, Chamaram, Palangal and Adaminte Makan Abu.\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nWahab was born in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh into a Muslim family. She is fluent in her mother tongue Telugu, in addition to Urdu, Hindi and English.[1] She was trained at Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune.[2] Wahab has three sisters and one brother.\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter receiving negative feedback about her appearance from film producer Raj Kapoor, Wahab worked on her appearance and attended film parties and events. She eventually got noticed and was cast in films.[3] She was usually cast as the middle-class girl after her first leading role in Basu Chatterjee's Chit Chor (1976) in movies like Agar, Jazbaat, Sawan Ko Aane Do, and Raees Zada. She was nominated for a Filmfare Award in the Best Actress category for Gharonda (1977).[4]  She has acted in many Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, films. Wahab made a comeback to Malayalam films with Calendar, in 2009[citation needed] and has continued to act in Malayalam movies. She is still remembered for her role in the critically acclaimed Adaminte Makan Abu.[citation needed] She also appeared in My Name Is Khan as the mother of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan's character).[5] Wahab currently plays older roles in television serials.[6]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWahab met actor Aditya Pancholi on the sets of Kalank Ka Tika.[7] They married in 1986 and have a daughter, Sana and a son, Sooraj. News of their turbulent marriage, her husband's temper and rumors of infidelity have been in the gossip columns.[8] Wahab's daughter is an actress.[9] Her son, Suraj, was arrested in June 2013, in connection with the death of Jiah Khan.[10] He made his Bollywood debut with Sunil Shetty's daughter Athiya Shetty in 2015 in the movie Hero.\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFeature films[edit]\n\nList of Zarina Wahab film credits\n\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nLanguage\n\nNotes\n\n\n1974\nIshq Ishq Ishq\nPrema\nHindi\n\n\n\n1975\nAnokha\nSudha Manchanda\n\n\n\nGajula Kishtayya\nRadha\nTelugu\n\n\n\n1976\nChitchor\nGeeta P.
