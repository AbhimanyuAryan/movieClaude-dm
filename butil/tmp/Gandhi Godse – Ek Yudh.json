The film stars Deepak Antani and Chinmay Mandlekar in the lead roles.[3] The film deals with a fictional situation in which Mahatma Gandhi survives his  assassination and thereafter decides to not only pardon Nathuram Godse, but also socialize with him.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nGodse holds Gandhi responsible for the partition and misery of Hindus. He shoots Gandhi on 30 January 1948 but Gandhi is miraculously saved and pardons Godse. After breaking his ties with the Congress, Gandhi begins his Gram Swaraj Movement to inspire villages towards self-reliance. Meanwhile, the system highlights Godse's writing and manipulates public sentiment against Gandhi whose interference has created a ruckus within the government. This leads to Gandhi's arrest which he insists on serving with Godse. They have multiple debates and arguments, even confrontations in prison. Soon Gandhi and Godse start to understand each other. Gradually Gandhi brought a change over Godse. During a marriage held by Gandhi, another attacker tries to shoot and kill him, Godse saves his life and soon together they are released from jail.\n\nCast[edit]\nDeepak Antani as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\nChinmay Mandlekar as Nathuram Vinayak Godse\nTanisha Santoshi as Sushma\nAnuj Saini as Naren\nPawan Chopra as Jawaharlal Nehru\nMukund Pathak as B. R. Ambedkar[4]\nGhanshyam Srivastav as Vallabhbhai Patel\nSandeep Bhojak as Jailer Amod Rai[5]\nVipul Deshpande as DSP Rana\nProduction[edit]\nSantoshi confessed in pre-release promotions that it was hard to receive investment for such a large scale film with a potentially controversial subject. He added that it was only after composer A. R. Rahman accepted to do the film, investors started showing interest, and the film may not have been made if Rahman said 'no'.[6]\nFilming commenced on 20 September 2020 and was wrapped on 6 May 2022. Bhopal and Mumbai served as the principal locations.\n\nMusic[edit]\nGandhi Godse Ek YudhSoundtrack album by A.R.
