The story involves a man who becomes pregnant. The film received highly negative reviews.\n\n\nCast[edit]\nRiteish Deshmukh as Amol Khote\nGenelia D'Souza as Gugloo Khote\nMahesh Manjrekar as Dr. Rampal Satsangi / Dr. Lakhanpal Satsangi (Double Role)\nProduction[edit]\nThe film began production in March of 2022.[1]\n\nControversy[edit]\nIn 2019, Kolkata-based producer Akash Chatterjee told T-Series the story of Vicky Pet Se, which he wanted to star Ayushmann Khurrana. T-Series had agreed to co-produce the film. Mister Mummy has the same storyline as his script but Chatterjee argues that he did not get due credit. The poster of Mister Mummy is also similar to a poster of Vicky Pet Se.[2]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nAll lyrics are written by KumaarTrack listingNo.TitleMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Chupke Chupke\"Rochak KohliRochak Kohli, Armaan Malik, Shilpa Rao4:572.\"Papaji Pet Se\"Sneha KhanwalkarAmit Gupta, Sneha Khanwalkar2:503.\"Mister Mummy (Title Track)\"Sneha KhanwalkarAmit Gupta, Harjot Kaur, Sneha Khanwalkar2:274.\"Rut Mastani\"Sneha KhanwalkarHarjot Kaur, Sneha Khanwalkar2:235.\"Uncle Ji\"Sneha KhanwalkarJakir Hussen, Jasu Khan, Sneha Khanwalkar3:19Total length:15:56\nReception[edit]\nA critic from The Times of India wrote that \"All things considered, Mister Mummy could have explored a lot more with the material at hand. But Shaad Ali ends up losing out on this opportunity. Definitely not worth watching\".[3] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that \"The film is neither a comedy ... nor an emotional drama of an estranged couple still in love\".[4] A critic from Koimoi wrote that \"Mister Mummy cannot find a redemption because it doesn\u2019t even try to find one\".[5] A critic from The Quint wrote that \"Yet another mediocre Bollywood slapstick comedy that is nothing but repackaged queerphobia\".[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Riteish Deshmukh-Genelia Deshmukh starrer 'Mister Mummy' goes on floors\".
