Both run a movers and packers company called \u2018Gently Gently\u2019. Amreek has a laidback and carefree attitude and doesn't believe in owning up to his mistakes. This affects his work and also his relations with Radha. Fed up with his behaviour, Radha breaks up with him. Amreek is devastated. \nThis is when his father, Gurkeerat aka Gurki calls him from his home in Amritsar. He tells Amreek that he should return immediately as his grandmother, Sardar Kaur, is sick. Sardar, aged 90, has a tumour. The doctors advise Gurki that they should take her home as operating her at this age can prove fatal. Gurki realizes Sardar doesn't have much time but he hides this fact from Sardar. \nSardar, meanwhile, has a wish. She wants to go to Lahore and visit the house that she built with her husband, late Gursher Singh in 1946. A year later, during Partition, Gursher was stabbed to death while fighting the rioters. Sardar however escaped and reached India. Since then, she has been missing Gursher and the house. Hence, it's her desire to visit Pakistan so that she could see her ancestral house. Sardar tells Amreek about it. \nGurki advises Sardar that she can't travel in this condition. But Amreek realizes how much this means to her. He promises her that he'll help fulfil her wish. He tries to get her visa. However, her application is rejected as she's blacklisted from visiting Pakistan. This is because a few years ago, she had attacked a Pakistani official, Saqlain Niazi when she had gone to watch an India vs Pakistan cricket match in Mohali. \nThis is when Amreek learns that Radha has transplanted a nearly hundred-year-old tree in the United States. Amreek thus begins to learn about structural relocation and realizes that a lot of people have successfully lifted a house and transplanted it to a different location. Amreek requests help from both the government of India and Pakistan for his mission. Both decide to help him, in principle. Amreek then decides to visit Lahore. However, he hides about his plan from Sardar. He fears that if he fails in his endeavour, she'll be heartbroken. Hence, Amreek pretends to go back to Los Angeles in front of Sardar. \nAmreek reaches Lahore and is successfully able to find Sardar's house. But when he reaches there, he sees that the local authorities are about to demolish the structure. But he stops it and manages to convince the mayor (who is actually Saqlain Niazi, the official whom his grandmother had hit in the match) he brings back the house, thus fulfilling Sardar's wish. \nIn the end of the film, it is revealed that Sardar dies seven years after, and divides the property in three equal shares. It is also revealed that Amreek and Radha marry and move to back to America and have two daughters and a son, named after his grandmother.\n\nCast[edit]\nArjun Kapoor as Amreek Singh\nNeena Gupta as Swanmeet \"Sardar\" Kaur, Amreek's grandmother\nAditi Rao Hydari as Young Swanmeet \"Sardar\" Kaur (Special appearance)\nRakul Preet Singh as Radha Kaur Khasan, Amreek's love interest\nJohn Abraham as Gursher Singh, Amreek's deceased grandfather (Special appearance)\nKanwaljit Singh as Gurkeerat \"Gurkhi\" Singh, Amreek's father\nSoni Razdan as Simmi Kaur Sodhi, Amreek's mother\nKumud Mishra as Saqlain Niazi, Lahore city mayor\nDivya Seth as Honey, Sardar's second daughter-in-law\nMahika Patiyal as Pinky Kaur, Amreek's sister\nMasood Akhtar as Khan Sahab\nRavjeet Singh as Lovely\nAkashdeep Sabir as Contractor\nMir Mehroos as Chhote\nShahid Lateef as Inspector Rauf Khalid\nArvinder Bhatti as  Gurbaz Chacha\nRajiv Kachroo as Pakistani High Commissioner Qureshi\nPriya Tandon as Pakistani Journalist\nProduction[edit]\nThe principal photography commenced in Mumbai on 16 November 2019.[7][8]\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 20% of 10 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.2/10.
