He drinks alcohol and parties the night before the flight, and feels tired on boarding it, where his co-pilot is Tanya Albuquerque. Later, a cyclone in Cochin leads to the flight being diverted to Trivandrum on Khanna's suggestion, despite objection from Albuquerque. Albuquerque says that Bengaluru has to be the second option, not Trivandrum, as the latter is near Cochin and has a high chance of having bad weather too. Khanna says that if they divert to Trivandrum, they can attempt a landing there and save fuel. Due to miscommunication, the pilots do not realize that Trivandrum is facing weather worse than Cochin, which reduces the visibility level. Captain Khanna somehow manages to land the flight while closing his eyes, and averts a major disaster. \nPrior to an enquiry, a small interrogation takes place, including Khanna's medical test. The instrument, however, is damaged and isn't able to reveal whether or not Khanna is drunk. The enquiry is held regarding the pilots' actions, headed by AAIB Head Narayan Vedant. The enquiry is held mainly because Alma Asthana, an elderly woman who was on the flight and was the sole passenger to trust Khanna with his decision to divert to Trivandrum, had died of a heart attack on her way to the hospital. During the enquiry, a polygraph is conducted on Khanna. Vedant scares Albuquerque with his questions and she mistakenly reveals that Khanna had closed his eyes during landing. \nDuring the next session of the enquiry, Khanna reveals that he has a photographic memory, so he knew what he was doing during landing, even though his eyes were closed as he was imagining everything in his mind based on past landings on the same runway. He eventually proves it through a simulated flight with Vedant as his co-pilot. He makes the same movements that he did on the night of the landing, this time wearing an eye cap over his eyes, to assure Vedant that he can land flights without seeing. He is suspended for three months, but is praised for his skill. After three months Vikrant is going for his next flight and it is revealed that an air hostess drank the alcohol because of sheer terror.\n\nCast[edit]\nAjay Devgn as Captain Vikrant Khanna, The captain of Skyline 777[11]\nAmitabh Bachchan as Narayan Vedant, Head of AAIB[11]\nRakul Preet Singh as First Officer Tanya Albuquerque, Vikrant's co-pilot[12]\nBoman Irani as Nishant Suri, owner of the Skyline Airway company[13]\nAjay Shankar as Lijesh Joseph\nAngira Dhar as Radhika Roy, Vikrant's lawyer[14]\nAakanksha Singh as Samaira Khanna, Vikrant's wife[14]\nVasuki Punj as Ishita Bajaj\nCarryMinati as himself (cameo appearance)\nVijay Nikam as Santoshlal Tripathi, Employee at Cochin ATC\nAamil Keeyan Khan as Vikram Sukumaran, ATC Trivandrum\nFlora Jacob as Alma Asthana, the old lady who dies[11]\nRukhsana as Delilah Asthana\nAl-Mamun Al Siyam as Lumin\nHrishikesh Pandey as Yusuf Rangoonwala, Head of Pilot's Union\nRakesh Bhavsar as Ramiz\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe film was originally titled Mayday. In November 2021, the name of the upcoming film was changed to Runway 34.[15] The number \"34\" in the film's title was chosen because that was Ajay's age when his daughter Nysa was born.[16] The film is based on true events, in which a plane from Doha to Kochi landed with only a very small amount of fuel left.[17][18]\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe official announcement of the film was made on 7 November 2020[19] and principal photography began on 11 December 2020 in Hyderabad.[20] It is filmed at Hyderabad and Mumbai. The filming halted for sometime due to lockdown, COVID restrictions in 2021. In August 2021, Devgn travelled to Russia to do recce and finalise locations to film the scenes, reportedly later in September\nAjay Devgn, Rakul Preet and Boman Irani travelled to Russia to film some airport scenes.[21] The film was wrapped on 17 December 2021.[22]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released theatrically on 29 April 2022, coinciding with the festival of Eid.

Rakul Preet Singh gives a solid account of herself. As for Amitabh Bachchan and other actors, the path is riddled with air pockets caused by blurry writing\".[30]\nShilajit Mitra of Cinema Express gave the film a rating of 3/5 and wrote \"Runway 34 is a frequently tense, perfectly serviceable aviation thriller, a genre of questionable repute in Hindi cinema\".[31] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Runway 34 is a clumsy cocktail of Hollywood movies spiked with the Bollywood brand of God complex\".[32] Sanjana Jadhav of Pinkvilla gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Runway 34 can be a one-time watch but there are better aviation dramas you may want to explore\".[33] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Ajay Devgn manages to deliver a somewhat effective pre interval portion despite its inelegant, underlined bits, but the film plummets as the curse of second half hits\".[12] Navneet Vyasan of News 18 gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Good VFX but Ajay Devgn's character feels cliched, Amitabh Bachchan holds together the enquiry scenes\".[13]\nAnna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote \"Runway 34 is unmemorable because it lacks a sense of urgency even while recounting a life-and-death story.\".[34] Monika Rawal Kukreja of The Hindustan Times stated \"The Ajay Devgn directorial, which stars himself, Amitabh Bachchan, and Rakul Preet Singh is an edgy, fast-paced aviation drama that ends up being a great big screen cinematic experience\".[35]\n\nMusic[edit]\nRunway 34Soundtrack album by Jasleen RoyalReleased3 June 2022[36]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength15:47LanguageHindiLabelPanorama MusicOfficial audioRunway 34- Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's music composed by Jasleen Royal while lyrics written by Aditya Sharma.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Mitra Re\"Arijit Singh, Jasleen Royal3:412.\"The Fall Song\"Jasleen Royal3:083.\"Jalaya Toh Nahin Na\" (Music by Yashraj Mukhate & lyrics by Akshay Shinde)Yashraj Mukhate, Ajay Devgn2:214.\"Mitra Re (Reprise)\"Arijit Singh, Jasleen Royal3:295.\"The Fall Song (English Version)\"Jasleen Royal3:086.\"Mitra Re (Arijit Singh Version)\"Arijit Singh3:42Total length:19:29\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Certificate Detail\".
