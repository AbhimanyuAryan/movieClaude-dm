She hosts a successful TV show aptly called \"Face The Truth\" and enjoys celebrity status which is also desired by her competitors, peers and juniors alike. In her private life, she lives with her son, Ayush, who has cerebral palsy, and her mother. She is somewhat in a romantic relationship with her boss. Maya is on great terms with her ex-husband who's now happily married to his current Russian wife and they have a baby boy. All in all, her life seems perfect until one fateful night Maya falls asleep at the wheel of her car whilst driving home late from work. She inadvertently hits a young girl who suddenly appears in front of her car out of nowhere. After the accident she stops and sees another bystander who's fleeing the scene and she gets spooked and flees the scene of the accident not knowing that it's all captured on a nearby CCTV camera.\nMaya arrives home deeply shaken. She inspects the damage to her car and covers up the car, again caught on security cameras. Rukhsana, is her son's carer and cook. Rukhsana had stayed at Maya's for the night, per Maya's request, as she was running late that night. Rukhsana loves Ayush like her own son. She sees that Maya is very upset, but chooses to ignore it.\nThe next morning, the story starts to unravel. The young girl turns out to be Rukhsana's daughter. Rukhsana is unsure and embarrassed about why her 18-year-old daughter was out so late at night, and what she was doing in the neighborhood where the hit and run happened.\nThe police officer, assigned to the case, discovers (from CCTV footage) his own indiscretion that took place at the same spot, an hour before the accident. Hence, he is motivated to not disclose the CCTV footage (the only proof of Maya's crime) and suppress the case for his own protection and wellbeing in light of his daughter's upcoming wedding.\nThe guy fleeing the scene assumed to be the guy the girl was seeing who she had gone out late at night to see. He had tried to make physical advances at her, and the girl was running away from him, when she was hit. So he also chooses to stay silent for his own protection. Only later it is revealed that the girl was there to make videos to post on social media and get more followers. The girl had recently broke up with her boyfriend who works at a mechanic's shop.\nMaya's driver who discovers the car damaged and a girl's earring stuck in the broken windshield figures out that Maya was the culprit, but he also remains silent as he needs half a million from Maya to pay for his family's critical expenses.\nMaya confesses her crime to her boss, but he encourages her to stay silent, as he is protecting the news station (which is immensely successful due to Maya) as well as himself due to fear of his personal relationship with her coming to light.\nThe journalist pursuing the case, who discovers all truths, happens to work for Maya, and respects her deeply. She also needs her job and money due to domestic family pressures.\nDo any of these folks come forward? How do they suffer in personal guilt, and what toll it takes on them? Can the details of everyone's truth ever be discovered for the case to be fairly solved? Jalsa takes the viewer through this journey and leave an open ending for viewers to decide.\n\nCast[edit]\nVidya Balan as Maya Menon\nShefali Shah as Rukhsana Mohammad\nRohini Hattangadi as Rukmini\nSurya Kasibhatla as Ayush Menon\nManav Kaul as Anand\nKashish Rizwan as Aliyah Mohammad\nShafeen Patel as Imaad\nVidhatri Bandi as Rohini George\nIqbal Khan as Amar Malhotra\nGhanshyam Lalsa as Pradeep\nShrikant Mohan Yadav as More\nJunaid Khan as Rizwan\nGurpal Singh as Justice Gulati\nProduction[edit]\nThe principal photography commenced on 12 August 2021[7] and wrapped up on 12 January 2022.[8]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nJalsaSoundtrack album by Gaurav Chatterji and Salvage Audio CollectiveReleased23 April 2022[9]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength16:39LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesOfficial audioJalsa - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Gaurav Chatterji and Salvage Audio Collective with lyrics written by Sandeep Gaur and Charan.[9]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsSinger(s)Length1.\"Thehar\"Sandeep GaurShilpa Rao3:402.\"Thehar\" (Male Version)Sandeep GaurGaurav Chatterji3:383.\"Raat\" (Music by Salvage Audio Collective)CharanVishwesh Krishnamoorthy2:134.\"Jalsa - Theme\"-Instrumental1:485.\"Maya's Guilt\"-Instrumental2:406.\"Ruksana's Pain\"-Instrumental1:007.\"The Drive\"-Instrumental1:40Total length:16:39\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was premiered on Amazon Prime on 18 March 2022 coinciding with Holi.[10]\n\nReception[edit]\nJalsa received positive reviews from critics.\nRenuka Vyavahare of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote \"Jalsa, a captivating drama with a complex moral center, keeps you on the edge of your seat for most part of the film.
