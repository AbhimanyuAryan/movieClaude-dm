The film was digitally premiered on ZEE5 from 14 March 2024.[14]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe movie drew a lukewarm response at the box office. It's reportedly earned Rs 1 crore on its day of release.[15] Internationally too, it failed to get much attention drawing only $1.5 million at the global box office in its first week.[16]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 33% of 12 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10.[17]\nA reviewer from Bollywood Hungama awarded the film 2/5 stars and wrote \"Main Atal Hoon rests on Pankaj Tripathi\u2019s outstanding performance. But it suffers big time due to its flawed and disjointed narrative.\"[18] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Despite Pankaj Tripathi's inspired portrayal, the film is reduced to a rah-rah hagiography of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and fails to do justice to his multiple facets.\"[19]\nNDTV's Saibal Chatterjee rated the film 2/5 and wrote \"In a purely cinematic sense, it is impossible to be enthused over what Main Atal Hoon has to offer. But in the context of the film's undisguised raison d'etre, it may not be a total washout.\"[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Main Atal Hoon (12A)\".
