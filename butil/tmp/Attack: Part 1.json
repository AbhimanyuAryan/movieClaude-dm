After a shootout in Rehman's hideout, Arjun arrests Rehman and saves a suicide bomber, who is actually Rehman's son Hamid Gul.\n12 years later at Mumbai Airport, Arjun meets Ayesha, an air hostess, and they fall in love. However, the airport is attacked by Hamid's men, where Ayesha is killed and Arjun is paralysed from the neck down. V. K. Subramaniam, who is the Chief of Indian Intelligence and Arjun's superior officer, proposes an AI-operated supersoldier program to the Prime Minister. Sabaha Qureshi, a DRDO, has been modifying the supersoldiers program for 7 years and is on the verge of a major breakthrough.\nThe Prime Minister agrees and Subramaniam selects Arjun for the program. Arjun is hesitant, but agrees as he wants to avenge Ayesha's death. Arjun operates himself under the command of the Intelligent Robotic Assistant or I.R.A, which is restricted due to Arjun's trauma. The government discovers that Hamid is procuring chemical weapons in Eastern Europe. Sabaha arrives at the parliament to submit Arjun's progress to the Defence Minister. While conversing with I.R.A, Arjun learns that Hamid is planning to attack the parliament and informs Subramaniam, who is at the Sansad Marg.\nHamid and his fellow terrorists, disguised as Rapid Action Force personnel, hijack the parliament and capture the parliament ministry and Union Ministers, including the Prime Minister and Sabaha. Arjun leaves for the Parliament with NSG commandos, but Hamid demands that the NSG retreat from the parliament in exchange for the release of 50 hostages. Subramabiam insists to the caretaker Prime Minister Digvijay Singh to perform a partial extraction, and sends Arjun to covertly infiltrate the parliament and relay information. Arjun sneaks into the Parliament with I.R.A's help and kills some guards as he enters the control room and provides live feed to Subramaniam.\nHamid demands the release of Rehman, while Sabaha is caught by the terrorist Hussain and is about to be assaulted, but Arjun kills Hussain and rescues her. Arjun reveals himself to Hamid via a walkie talkie and Hamid insists that Digvijay, Subramaniam and others command Arjun to surrender. Arjun agrees to surrender and is taken to Hamid, where one of Hamid's men knocks Arjun's neck, causing a malfunction in I.R.A. Hamid demands a safe passage to flee in an aeroplane to Ecuador and releases the hostages, but activates a sarin gas bomb to explode in the parliament. Rehman is released from prison and taken to the airport.\nSabaha retrieves her laptop and reboots I.R.A., enabling Arjun to kill all the terrorists. Arjun tells Subramaniam about the bomb and asks to intercept Hamid, but Hamid has already escaped via an old tunnel and leaves for the airport in an ambulance. Arjun tells Sabaha to retreat with the hostages and chases Hamid to the airport, where he crashes the flight. Arjun kills Hamid and deactivates the bomb. Sabaha rescues the hostages and the NSG commandos kill Rehman by throwing him out of the plane in mid-air. Arjun is appreciated by Subramaniam and the ministers, and leaves the parliament by ambulance. Later, Arjun is appointed for another mission.\n\nCast[edit]\nJohn Abraham as Major Arjun Shergill, a cyborg & India\u2019s first supersoldier[10]\nRakul Preet Singh as Dr. Sabaha Qureshi, DRDO scientist\nJacqueline Fernandez as Ayesha Roy, an air hostess and Arjun's lover\nPrakash Raj as Vadraj Kumar \"V.K\" Subramaniam, Defence Secretary and Arjun's superior officer\nRatna Pathak Shah as Shanti Shergill, Arjun's mother\nSerena Walia as I.R.A (voice), Arjun's personal AI assistant\nElham Ehsas as Hamid Gul, Rehman's son and the main antagonist\nRajit Kapur as Home Minister Digvijay Singh\nKiran Kumar as Indian Army Chief K.V.

Part 1 of this movie is a thorough entertainer for people who enjoy action to the T. The film is a surprisingly cool and edge-of-the-seat thriller\".[21] Grace Cyril of India Today gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"Attack stands well with its VFX and new concepts, all coated in a layer of slick modern sci-fi\".[22]\nAvinash Lohana of Pinkvilla gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"Keep an open mind, don\u2019t compare, and give the film a chance. You might like it\".[23] Bharathi Pradhan of Lehren gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"John may take a bow because he is one of the producers of the film and has been credited with the story idea too\".[24] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"Attack - Part 1 works due to the novel concept, action, VFX and John Abraham\u2019s first-rate performance\".[4]\nRohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"'Attack - Part 1' might be a beginning of a new era in the Hindi film industry only if you ignore the long list of loopholes and clich\u00e9 sequences\".[25] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"To the credit of director Lakshya Raj Anand, the fast-paced hostage drama stops short of being a dreadful assault on the senses\".[26] Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"We know exactly how things will pan out, no strain on the brain. Everything is straight-forward, no complicated characters, no morally ambiguous situations\".[27]\nVijay Mruthyunjaya of Deccan Herald gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"'Attack\u2019 does not preach patriotism with painfully long dialogues and agonising sentiments. It relies wholly on lightning and thunder and Abraham delivers both in equal measure\".[28]\nShubham Kulkarni of Koimoi gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Lakshya Raj Anand only focuses on the battle sequences and everything that happens between them looks lazy\".[29] Tatsam Mukherjee of Firstpost gave 1/5 stars and wrote \"Whatever might be the measures taken by an earlier John Abraham film, there seems to be a renewed bloodlust in Attack, that\u2019s actively trying to court the \u2018masses\u2019 of Uri: The Surgical Strike and The Kashmir Files\".[30]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times wrote \"Attack is your high-on-action sci-fi flick which is slick and savvy. Watch it for John being at his best after a long time and don't care too much about the unrealistic world it takes you to\".[31] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote \"Taut and fast-paced, the action choreography is closer to the stuff that Hollywood offers and the electric background score provides reason for the adrenaline glands to make their presence felt\".[32] Onmanorama wrote \"Overall, the film is well-written, but the story seems to be an amalgamation of many sci-fi English films. The film is slickly shot and the director wastes little time getting to the action\".[33]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nAttackFilm score by Shashwat SachdevReleased13 March 2022[34]Recorded2021VenueYRFStudioYRF StudiosGenreFeature film soundtrackLength30:40LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyProducerShashwat SachdevShashwat Sachdev chronology\n\n\nUri: The Surgical Strike(2019)\n\nAttack(2022)\n\n2023(Tejas)\nOfficial audioAttack - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's music is composed by Shashwat Sachdev while lyrics written by Kumaar and Bjorn Surrao.[34]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleSinger(s)Length1.\"Ik Tu Hai\"Jubin Nautiyal, Shashwat Sachdev4:102.\"Main Nai Tuttna\"Vishal Mishra, Shashwat Sachdev, Tisoki3:253.\"Chal Hatt\"Girish Nakod, Magic, Shashwat Sachdev2:264.\"Phir Se Zara\"Jubin Nautiyal, Shashwat Sachdev3:505.\"La La La\" (Lyrics by Bjorn)Bjorn, Shashwat Sachdev2:186.\"BOMB!\"Shreya Jain, Girish Nakod, Shashwat Sachdev2:257.\"Crazy Now\"Shreya Jain, Magic, Shashwat Sachdev, Tisoki2:438.\"Akh Kashni\"Surbhi Yadav, Nakul Chugh, Shashwat Sachdev2:129.\"Phir se Zara - Sha\"Shashwat Sachdev3:3410.\"Durga Gayatri Mantra\"Shreya Jain, Nakul Chugh, Shashwat Sachdev3:16Total length:30:19\nFuture[edit]\nAs indicated by the title, the film was made as part of a planned franchise. Director Anand has stated to Hindustan Times, \"We have created these characters whose journey doesn\u2019t end after part one, the journey begins. And he takes the learning from what happens in part one to part two and three. It automatically lends itself to action films\".[35] For Attack: Part 2, John Abraham has said that a script is ready and they \"signed on for Attack 2 with Jayanthi Bhai even before the release of Attack.\"[36]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Certificate Detail\".
