The film was released on 9 April 2021 on Amazon Prime Video.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nM. D. Makwana is a wanted fraudster who must escape from Mumbai after duping banks of a lot of money, for which his model girlfriend suggests disguising him as a caged gorilla so that he would be undiscovered, while at the same time, Toto, a real gorilla escapes from a crashed plane and is also declared wanted.\nChirag \"Charlie\" Rastogi is a young daydreamer from Indore who has been unsuccessful in whatever ventures he has partaken. Later, while at the disposition of his uncle Karsan (Darshan Jariwala), who leaves for Diu, he is assigned the job of escorting a gorilla to a circus by the model, little realizing that it is Makwana in disguise. Along the way, a series of adventures follows as Chirag finds himself confused between both Toto and Makwana, while a female circus acrobat-cum-dancer, Padma, tags along even as a forest ranger and a veterinary doctor are on the hunt for Toto.\n\nCast[edit]\nJackie Shroff as M.
