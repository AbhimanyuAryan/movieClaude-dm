Tewari and produced by Vashu Bhagnani, Jackky Bhagnani and Deepshikha Deshmukh under Pooja Entertainment.[2] A remake of the 2018 Tamil film Ratsasan written and directed by Ram Kumar, it stars Akshay Kumar in the lead role with Rakul Preet Singh, Joshua LeClair, Chandrachur Singh and Sargun Mehta.[3][4]\nThe film premiered on Disney+ Hotstar on 2 September 2022.[5]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe corpse of 15-year-old student Samiksha, who was brutally murdered, is discovered. Arjan Sethi is an aspiring filmmaker who wants to make a film on  Psychopaths. After multiple rejections from film producers and pressure from his family, he becomes a SI in the Himachal Pradesh Police, with the help of his brother-in-law Narinder Singh, a police officer himself. While Arjan does have a significant rank, he is treated like a rookie, due to lack of police experience. He moves in with his sister Seem, Narinder, and their daughter Payal. Payal gets into trouble in school and asks Arjan for help, so he meets her teacher Divya at school, posing as Payal's father, though soon exposed. He also befriends Divya's hearing and speech-impaired niece, Iti.\nMeanwhile, Arjan investigates the abduction of a schoolgirl, Amrita. He finds similarities between Samiksha and Amrita's case, due to the mutilations on a doll found at Amrita's house. But his attempts to convince his superior officer, SHO Gudiya Parmar, go futile. A few days later, Amrita's mutilated corpse is found. The coroner suggests that the perpetrator's modus operandi is the same as Samiksha's. Over the next few days, another hearing-impaired girl named Komal from  Divya's school is abducted and killed. The search leads to Purushottam Tomar, a teacher at the new school Payal is enrolled in. Tomar is a pedophile who forces girls into inappropriate acts. Payal herself narrowly escapes Purushottam Tomar when Arjan nabs him after getting a tip-off from another victim. While trying to get a confession from him on the spot, Arjan discharges his service firearm. Tomar admits to being a sexual predator but denies the murder charges. In a bid to escape, he holds Parmar at gunpoint, but Arjan guns down Tomar.\nThe same day, Payal is abducted from her birthday party at home and Arjan finds her corpse in their car trunk two days later. To make things worse, Arjan is suspended for his negligence in using his gun when arresting Tomar. Dejected and angry, Arjan unofficially investigates the case himself with the help of a few policemen, including Head Constable Mahinder Guleria. Finding an audio clip from Komal's hearing aid, he traces a piano tune back to a lady magician/pianist Agnes, who performed at all the victims' schools. Arjan informs his findings to SHO Parmar who believes him and re-appoints him on the case. Arjan finds that Agnes picks her victims by randomly calling them onto the stage, then kills them within the next few days and her next target would be a girl named Aisha. He tries to warn Aisha but despite constant surveillance, she is abducted. Arjan and his team track her location and save Aisha from being murdered. Agnes escapes and goes to Divya's house, where she attacks Divya and kidnaps Iti.\nArjan tracks Agnes to a nearby abandoned building and discovers that Agnes is a man. The man reveals himself to be Christopher, the son of Agnes, who was arrested many years ago after killing a young beautiful girl similar to the other victims. Christopher reveals that he has progeria, and was bullied when he was younger. A young girl, Sofia, became friends with him when he was younger, but when he confessed his love to her, she humiliated him. Agnes invited Sofia to her home sometime later, where Agnes helped Christopher kill her. Agnes took the blame for the murder, but after her passing, Christopher decided to dress up as her and continue killing other girls, as they reminded him of Sofia.\nArjan and Christopher fight, but thanks to Iti, Arjan is able to take him down. Divya comes to aid Arjan, as he and Iti walk away from Christopher's body.\n\nCast[edit]\nAkshay Kumar as SI Arjan Sethi\nRakul Preet Singh as Divya Bakshi\nJoshua LeClair as Christopher \"Agnes\" Fernandez\nChandrachur Singh as Narinder Singh\nSargun Mehta as SHO Gudia Parmar\nSujith Shankar as Purushottam Tomar\nGurpreet Ghuggi as Head Constable Mahinder Guleria\nShahid Latief as SI Ravichand Machchan\nHrishita Bhatt as Seema Sethi Singh\nRenaye Tejani as Payal Singh\nSuhani Dhanki as RJ Roshini Beniwal\nSuhani Sethi as Sofia\nShilpa Sapatnekar as class teacher\nAlireza Hasanvand\nProduction[edit]\nIn October 2018, Vishnu Vishal, the lead actor of Ratsasan confirmed that he acquired the Hindi remake rights of the film.[6] Initial reports claimed that actor Ayushmann Khurrana was approached for the remake.[7][8] However in July 2021, Akshay Kumar and Rakul Preet Singh were confirmed to star in the remake which was then titled Mission Cindrella.[9]\nThe film began first schedule on 21 August 2021 in UK which ended in October 2021.[10] Principal photography resumed in February 2022 at Mussoorie, and the entire film wrapped up in Dehradun on 17 February 2022.[11][12]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nCuttputlliSoundtrack album by Tanishk Bagchi, Dr Zeus and Aditya DevReleased30 August 2022[13]Recorded2022GenreFeature film soundtrackLength14:00LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioCuttputlli - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Tanishk Bagchi, Dr Zeus and Aditya Dev.
