The film is the third installment  in Baaghi series and stars Tiger Shroff, Riteish Deshmukh and Shraddha Kapoor.[4][5] It also features Ankita Lokhande, Jaideep Ahlawat, Vijay Varma, Jameel Khoury, Jackie Shroff, Satish Kaushik, Virendra Saxena and Manav Gohil in pivotal roles. The first half and climax are based on Tamil film Vettai (2012).[6]\nThe action sequences were choreographed by Ram-Lakshman and Kecha Khamphakdee.[7] Principal photography of the film began on 12 September 2019 in Mumbai.[8][9] The makers wanted to shoot in Syria but the producers Fox Star Studios declined due to safety issues due to which sets resembling the Syrian topography were built in Serbia.[10]\nBaaghi 3 was theatrically released in India on 6 March 2020. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. It gained a lot of praise for the Action Scenes and Cinematography but was criticized for the script, and the weak writing behind the film. The film's collections were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the theatres were shut down, though still it became a commercial success.  It\u2019s the second highest grossing Bollywood Film of 2020, earning estimated \u20b9137.05 crore (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide gross from \u20b9111.15 crore (US$14\u00a0million) domestically in India and \u20b925.9 crore (US$3.2\u00a0million) internationally.[3] There were plans for a re-release once the outbreak would end, but the makers instead decided to release it on digital platforms.[11][12]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nRanveer \"Ronnie\" Charan Chaturvedi lives with his elder brother Vikram in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Ronnie has been protective towards him since childhood, especially after their father Charan Chaturvedi's death. Ronnie is offered a job in the police force, but refuses because he has 33 cases registered against him, all for saving Vikram and convinces him to take on the job. A timid and reluctant Vikram becomes a cop. When a hostage situation arises, Vikram is assigned the job and is terrified to face the criminals, but Ronnie accompanies him, fighting off the goons and helping rescue the hostages. He does not take credit, and this process continues with Vikram getting popular among the public and his department after each case. Ronnie later falls in love with a woman named Siya, and they get their respective siblings Vikram and Ruchi married to each other. One day, Vikram is assigned to go for routine paperwork to Damascus, Syria. Upon arriving, Vikram chats with Ronnie over a video call but is suddenly beaten and kidnapped by terrorist Abu Jalal Gaza's men who break into his hotel room, and Ronnie watches helplessly as Vikram begs for Ronnie's help.\nRonnie and Siya travel to Syria, where the local police refuses to help them. They meet Akhtar Lahori, who helps them track Vikram and his captors. They go to Vikram's hotel while the cops start looking for the trio. In Vikram's hotel room, Ronnie finds Vikram's damaged phone and escapes with Siya and Akhtar before the cops can catch them. The trio finds the attacker, resulting in a chase. The exhausted attacker agrees to help before being hit by a truck and dying. Siya retrieves the attacker's phone and texts a goon named IPL (Inder Paheli Lamba) to meet at a hotel. Abu Jalal Gaza, the mastermind, arrives to avenge his brother, the attacker's death. The main cop who supports Ronnie captures IPL while Abu Jalal escapes. Fearing betrayal from IPL since he's been arrested, Abu Jalal orders his men to kill him. Ronnie and the team cleverly stage a series of events that lead to Abu's men believing they've been betrayed by IPL. They attack him, and upon being rescued by Ronnie, IPL decides to help him.\nRonnie single-handedly battles Abu Jalal's army before going to rescue Vikram and the hostages. IPL sacrifices himself, and Abu agrees to free everyone but captures Siya. Ronnie fights Abu Jalal's men, but as Vikram starts getting enraged to see Ronnie getting brutally beaten up, Ronnie stops fighting back. He is stabbed and nearly killed, causing a transformation in Vikram, who jumps out of the cell and brutally fights off everyone, finally impaling Abu Jalal on steel rods. Vikram and Siya try to revive Ronnie, and as Abu emerges to attack them from behind, Ronnie wakes and kills him. Returning to India, Vikram is honoured for his bravery while Ronnie imagines their father, a cop, saluting and hugging him for keeping his promise.\n\nCast[edit]\nTiger Shroff as Ranveer \"Ronnie\" Charan Chaturvedi, Vikram's younger brother and Siya's love interest\nAyaan Zubair Rahmani as Young Ronnie\nRiteish Deshmukh as Inspector Vikram Charan Chaturvedi, Ronnie's elder brother and Ruchi's husband\nYash Bhojwani as Young Vikram\nShraddha Kapoor as Siya Nandan, Ronnie's love interest and Ruchi's younger sister\nAnkita Lokhande as Ruchi Nandan Chaturvedi, Vikram's wife and Siya's elder sister\nJameel Khoury as Abu Jalal Gaza, leader of Jaish-e-Lashkar\nJaideep Ahlawat as Inder Paheli Lamba alias IPL\nVijay Varma as Akhtar Lahori\nJackie Shroff as Inspector Charan Chaturvedi, Ronnie and Vikram's deceased father (cameo appearance)\nSatish Kaushik as Bhoklelal Mupe Chatora, Agra Police Commissioner\nVirendra Saxena as Head Constable Kailash Tripathi\nIvan Kostadinov as Zaidi Jalal Gaza, Abu Jalal Gaza's brother\nManav Gohil as Asif Ali, Hafeeza's husband\nSunit Morarjee as Inspector Sharad Kute\nShriswara as Hafeeza Ali, Asif's wife\nDanish Bhat as Inspector Bilal Al Khatib, Syria Police\nShaurya Bharadwaj as Mishra Chacha, Charan\u2019s colleague and Ronnie & Vikram\u2019s uncle\nFarhad Samji as a Man in the cinema gents toilet\nDisha Patani in a special appearance in the song \"Do You Love Me\"[13]\nAekam Binjwe as Junaid Ali, Hafeeza & Asif\u2019s son\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was announced on 19 December 2018 with Tiger Shroff by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment on their Twitter (now X) account by releasing a teaser poster.[14] On 12 February 2019, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play lead opposite Tiger Shroff.[15] In June, it was announced that Riteish Deshmukh has joined the cast of the film.\n[16] In August 2019, it was announced that shooting of the film will take place in Morocco, Egypt, Serbia and Turkey.[17]\nPrincipal photography began on 12 September 2019 in Mumbai and wrapped up on 30 January 2020.[18][19]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIt was theatrically released in India on 6 March 2020.[citation needed]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nBaaghi 3 earned \u20b917.50 crore net at the domestic box office on the opening day, which was the highest opening day collection for 2020 Bollywood film so far.[20]\nAs of 15\u00a0March\u00a02020[update], with a gross of \u20b9111.15 crore in India and \u20b925.9 crore overseas, the film has a worldwide gross collection of \u20b9137.05\u00a0crore and became the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2020.[3][21]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 0% of 11 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.6/10.[22]\nBaaghi 3 received mixed reviews from critics and audiences.
