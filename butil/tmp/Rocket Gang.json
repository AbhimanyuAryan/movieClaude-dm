Produced by Zee Studios, it stars Aditya Seal and Nikita Dutta.[1][2]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nA group of young-adult friends arrives at Wonder-villa, a new resort, at night. Playing with a spirit board, they unwittingly summon the spirits of five children they had encountered earlier that day (not knowing that they were dead). The children, along with their dance coach, perished in a traffic accident caused by a car driven by Amarbir, one of the group members. Overwhelmed by guilt, the friends decide to allow the children to go to Dance India Dance (DID) and dance as they had wanted. The children want to perform one last dance for their mothers and agree to participate in the DID finals. However, the method they use to broadcast their performance to the world stops working. Heartbroken, the children fervently pray for one last opportunity to dance for their mothers. God answers their prayers, and with the support of their friends, they deliver a final performance. As the dance concludes, the children transform into golden butterflies and ascend to heaven, finding peace at last.\n\nCast[edit]\nAditya Seal as Amarbir\nNikita Dutta as Tania\nJason Tham as Bunnu\nRanbir Kapoor as an angel (in the song \"Har Bachcha Hai Rocket\")\nMokshda Jailkhani as Pia\nSahaj Singh as Sahib\nTejas Varma as JeJe\nAadvik Mongia as Montu\nJayshree Gogoi as Saher\nDipali Borkar as Kiara\nSiddhant Sharma as Ganesh\nProduction[edit]\nCasting[edit]\nThe cast of Rocket Gang\nBosco Martis was confirmed as director in May 2019 in his directorial debut.[3] In September of that year, Aditya Seal was confirmed in the lead role.[4] Nikita Dutta joined the cast as the female lead in August 2020.[5]\n\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe film was announced by Zee Studios during the first week of August 2020, directed by Bosco Martis and starring Aditya Seal and Nikita Dutta.[1] Principal photography was scheduled to begin in March 2020, but was postponed until December of that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6][7] Most scenes were shot in Mumbai and the Konkan,[8] and filming wrapped up in September 2021.[9][10]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nOn August 9, 2020, a motion poster of the film's logo was released.[11][12] Originally scheduled for release in 2021, Rocket Gang's release was postponed until the following year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
