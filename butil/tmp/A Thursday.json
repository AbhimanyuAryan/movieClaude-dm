The school is in the front of property owned by Rohit Mirchandani, Naina\u2019s fiance, where Rohit lives. Parents drop off their children and Naina asks one parent to send a cake, since the next day was their daughter Niharika\u2019s birthday. The parent asks if their driver can deliver the cake to the school. Everyone leaves, and Naina snaps; she calls the police station and tells them that she has 16 children as hostages. Niharika\u2019s driver arrives with a cake and Savitri, the helper, returns for her phone; both are also taken hostage.\nPolice suspect a hoax, but Naina fires a shot. ACP Catherine Alvarez contacts her, but Naina says that she will only negotiate with officer Javed Khan. Javed is brought to the scene, and she tells him that she will free one child for every demand he meets. Her first demand is for a transfer of \u20b95 crore to her account. Catherine and Javed had a romantic history, and are incompatible when working together. Catherine does not listen to Javed, and tries to send armed police inside. Naina kills Aakash, one of the children, in alphabetical order as she had said. The Commissioner of Police places Javed in charge, and assigns Catherine to do research.\nNaina\u2019s second demand is to speak to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister Maya Rajguru talks to Naina on the phone, and Naina urges her to meet her in person. Naina then tells Javed to find Rakesh Mathur and Charan Kumar, who she last knew were working at a school in Goregaon (a Mumbai suburb) and bring them to her. The police find Rakesh, but are unable to locate Charan. No one knows what Naina is up to, and Javed and his team have no choice but to agree to her demands because the children are still hostages.\nDuring a background check, Catherine learns that Naina has been taking antidepressants and seeing a psychologist since she was 16 years old. She searches Naina\u2019s house and finds receipts for medication prescribed by Dr. Juneja. Catherine contacts the doctor, and Javed gets hold of Naina\u2019s mother. Naina was raped when she was 16 years old, and Javed and Catherine were the officers in charge of the case. They paid little attention to Naina\u2019s case, since they were pursuing a high-profile case to gain recognition. After begging them to help for two years, Naina\u2019s mother became resigned to their indifference.\nPrime Minister Rajguru decides to meet Naina in person, accompanied only by Javed. Naina brings up the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, which become effective in 2012 to protect children under age 18. Naina asks the prime minister why there is no protection for people over 18, and demands that her rapists face the death penalty. Rajguru tells her that legislation is a complex task which requires time, but her rapists are found and imprisoned. Naina then says that the child she supposedly killed is actually alive.\nAlthough the police could not find Charan Kumar, Naina says that he is the family driver who had brought Niharika\u2019s birthday cake. He held Niharika's hand (arousing Naina's fear that he would rape the child as well), and Naina asked Niharika\u2019s mother to send him with the cake so she could take him hostage; he was her rapist, while Rakesh held her hands. Naina shoots Charan, and the commandos enter the school and arrest her. Rohit salutes her, referencing back to the start of the film where he says that you should only salute to people who deserve it.  While she is being transported to prison, Maya Rajguru brings up the issue of capital punishment in parliament. While teaching a class in prison, Naina picks up a newspaper, sees the headline, and smiles.  The film ends with a statistic: Every 16 minutes, a woman is raped.\n\nCast[edit]\nYami Gautam as Naina Jaiswal\nAtul Kulkarni as Javed Khan\nNeha Dhupia as ACP Catherine \"Cathy\" Alvarez\nDimple Kapadia as Prime Minister Maya Rajguru\nKaranvir Sharma as Rohit Mirchandani, Naina's fiance\nMaya Sarao as Shalini Guha, Naina's friend Yash's mother\nSukesh Anand as Lokhande\nKalyanee Mulay as Savitri, Naina's maid\nBoloram Das as Charan Kumar, Naina's rapist and Niharika's family driver\nShubhangi Latkar as Kusum Jaiswal, Naina's mother\nAdi Irani as Police Commissioner\nDivjyot Kaur as Renuka Dubey\nMicky Makhija as Rohit's father\nSanjeev Jotangia as Malcolm\nSulagna Chatterjee as Aakash's mom\nBhavin Hirani as Aakash's dad\nRaj Kumar sharma as Home Minister\nAsim Sharma as PM PR REP\nHardika Sharma as Niharika (play school student)\nPrachi Hada as journalist\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on 12 March 2021,[8][9][10] and wrapped in July of that year.[11][12][13]\n\nReception[edit]\nCyril of India Today gave the film a rating of four out of five and wrote, \"Yami Gautam's A Thursday is the kind of thriller that has been missing from Indian screens for a while\".[14] Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India rated it three out of five and wrote, \"Despite a rather predictable backstory, A Thursday redeems itself with its powerful emotional arc and social commentary in the latter half. It touches upon a relevant issue that will resonate with women across the globe\".[15]\nPradeep Menon of Firstpost gave the film a rating of 2.75 out of five and wrote, \"A Thursday strives to be urgent, relevant and cool, but succeeds only partially, because it stops to make a point far too often\".[16] Shubham Kulkarni of Koimoi rated it 2.5 out of five: \"A Thursday is a Yami Gautam show and she does bring her A-game on. But the set-up ditches her a bit\".[17] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 1.5 out of five and wrote, \"The chief problem with Yami Gautam's film is that we do not take any of this seriously, whether it is Naina brandishing a gun, or snarling and cooing at her hostages\".[18]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee / work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2022\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nBest Web Original Film\n\nA Thursday\n\nNominated\n\n[19]\n\n\nBest Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nYami Gautam\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Web Original Film\n\nAtul Kulkarni\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a Web Original Film\n\nNeha Dhupia\n\nWon\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nA ThursdaySoundtrack album by Rooshin Dalal and Kaizad GherdaReleased24 February 2022[20]Recorded2021GenreFeature-film soundtrackLength42:51LanguageHindiLabelRSVP MoviesProducerRooshin Dalal, Kaizad GherdaOfficial audioA Thursday - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe soundtrack to A Thursday contains twenty-one instrumental compositions used in the film score, curated and composed by Rooshin Dalal and Kaizad Gherda.[20]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLength1.\"Naina theme song\"1:502.\"The first call\"1:373.\"The Playschool\"1:174.\"The Quite\"0:435.\"Demand\"1:066.\"Wash your hands\"0:587.\"A for Akash\"2:068.\"Alvarez and Khan\"0:539.\"Back off Javed\"2:1010.\"Naina's Mind\"1:0311.\"Phir se bolna\"0:5612.\"Maya Rajguru\"1:3813.\"Rock a Bye Baby\" (Sung by Deelraz Bunshah)3:4714.\"The interview\"3:3015.\"Birthday Cake\"2:0716.\"Case\"2:0417.\"A Thursday\"6:2818.\"Let go\"2:3419.\"Do you know what it feels like\"3:2320.\"Stand off\"1:3121.\"The Last shot\"1:10Total length:42:51\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Thursday trailer: Yami Gautam as a deadly kidnapper challenges PM Dimple Kapadia, Neha Dhupia is a pregnant cop\".
