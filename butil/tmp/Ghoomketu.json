His father referred by everyone as 'Dadda' (elder brother) has a very high temper and married for the second time after death of his first wife, whereas his younger brother a local muscle-man remains unmarried after father of his lover refuses to marry his daughter with him. Over a period of time he becomes a strong politician of the region but is never out of word of Dadda. He is recently married to a girl in a group marriage ceremony, charitable function which was organized by his uncle. As fate would have it, his to be bride gets exchanged in the confusion of the group marriage and he ends up with a fat lady Janaki Devi and out of disappointment he doesn't even see her face even after 10 days marriage.\nDadda is deeply disappointed by antics of his Ghoomketu and never supports his dream of becoming a writer, however his aunt gives supports him wholeheartedly and gives him money and supplies enough to last 1 month in Mumbai so that he can fulfill his dream. After his disappearance his family launches a complaint in police and his uncle pressurizes police to find him within a month.\nHere in Mumbai Badlani, a lazy corrupt officer is assigned the case to find him in 30 days or be sent on a punishment posting. As fate would have it Ghoomketu finds nighttime accommodation in Badlani's Tailoring shop, however since there is no photo of Ghoomketu he is not able to identify him. Ghoomketu is of simple and jovial nature and befriends everyone around him including son and wife of Badlani.\nGhoomketu faces rejection everywhere, disheartened he decides to return. On his way home after visiting Shahrukh Khan's office his file of scripts is stolen. He goes to the police station where Badlani is working and as he is giving out his details Badlani realizes he is the person he is looking for. As he goes to verify his details Ghoomketu leaves for home. After a close chase he finally sees Ghoomketu's train departing and his final hope of retaining his post.\nWhen he reaches home, he whole heartedly apologizes to his wife and after some convincing she accepts his apology. Later his father comes terms with his son's aspirations and they have an emotional reunion. He is however pleasantly surprised to find Janaki has lost weight (because of depression) and when she reveals her face for the first time, he realizes how beautiful she is. His scripts are sold by a thief to a scrap dealer, which is bought by Bhelpuri vendor and reaches Amitabh Bachhan whilst he got Bhelpuri wrapped in Ghoomketu's script. He uses these lines in the climax of his film, which Ghoomketu watches at a local theater with his wife.\n\nCast[edit]\nNawazuddin Siddiqui as Ghoomketu\nRagini Khanna as Janki Devi\nRicha Chadda as Pagaliya\nAnurag Kashyap in a triple role as\nInspector Badlani\nBadlani's father\nBadlani's Grandfather\nRazak Khan as Sailu Nai\nBrijendra Kala as Editor Joshi\nDeepika Amin as Mrs. Badlani, Inspector's wife\nRaghuvir Yadav as Dadda\nIla Arun as Santo Bua\nSwanand Kirkire as Guddan Chacha\nJayant Gadekar as Inspector Shinde\nVarun Kulkarni as Assistant Director of Ghoomketu\nSatya Ranjan as Pagal\nAmitabh Bachchan in a cameo appearance\nRanveer Singh in a cameo appearance\nSonakshi Sinha in a cameo appearance\nChitrangada Singh in a cameo appearance\nNikkhil Advani in a cameo appearance\nLauren Gottlieb in a cameo appearance\nHuma Qureshi in a cameo appearance\nMohammad Nawaz as young Badlani\nProduction[edit]\nNawazuddin signed in this project to play the titular role of Ghoomketu in the lead role and it was the first time he signed to play a comic role in his film acting career.[6] The film marks maiden collaboration for Anurag Kashyap and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Anurag was roped in to play the small role as a police cop.[7] Lyricist Swanand Kirkire was roped into play the role of chacha to Nawazuddin.[8]\nThe shooting of the film was completed in 2014 and due to financial troubles as well as inability to find ideal distributors for film release, the film release was delayed for years.[2] The film was initially speculated to have its theatrical release on 16 November 2018 but was postponed.[citation needed]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nGhoomketuSoundtrack album by Sneha Khanwalkar Jasleen RoyalReleased20\u00a0May\u00a02020\u00a0(2020-05-20) (Film)Recorded2020GenreFeature Film soundtrackLanguageHindiLabelSangeet MusicProducerSneha Khanwalkar\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Truck Song\"Pushpendra Nath MisraSneha KhanwalkarBappi Lahiri\u00a02.\"Inspector Badlani Song\"Pushpendra Nath MisraSneha KhanwalkarRamonVarsha Singh Dhanoa\u00a03.\"Bird Song\"Pushpendra Nath MisraJasleen RoyalJasleen Royal\u00a0\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Upadhyay, Karishma (27 May 2020). \"Director Pushpendra Nath Misra on the slice-of-life comedy in 'Ghoomketu'\".
