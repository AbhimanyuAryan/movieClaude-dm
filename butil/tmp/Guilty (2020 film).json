She finds herself in a dilemma when Tanu Kumar, a new student in her university who has a crush on VJ, joins in the #MeToo movement accusing him of having sexually assaulted her on the night of Valentine's 2018 on Twitter. Nanki attempts to help Vijay by consulting Danish Ali Baig, the lawyer investigating VJ's side of the story. Throughout the movie, we experience Nanki's frequent panic attacks and hallucinations based on the recent incident. Later on in the movie, Danish wins the case and Vijay is released much to Tanu's dismay. VJ tells Nanki that he has cheated on her by sleeping with Tanu, but did not assault her. However, Nanki remains suspicious due to inconsistencies with the case. During a festival held at the campus, Tanu explains every detail of what happened during the fateful night while exposing her true intentions and feeling towards Vijay. Nanki deduces Tanu's #MeToo tweet and ties every loose end cited throughout the film and comes to the realization that Tanu told the truth all along that Vijay is actually a demon and raped Tanu when his ego got hurt. Vijay's crime gets reported by Nanki and is arrested by the local authorities. Soon after, Nanki gains the courage to share her own experience with sexual abuse, when she was 13 years old, encouraged by a relieved Tanu.\n\nCast[edit]\nKiara Advani as Nanki Dutta\u00a0: VJ's Girlfriend\nJanya Joshi as Young Nanki\nAkansha Ranjan Kapoor as Tanu Kumar\u00a0: The new girl in Nanki's university and VJ's crush\nGurfateh Pirzada as Vijay \"VJ\" Pratap Singh\u00a0: Nanki's boyfriend and Tanu's crush.\nTaher Shabbir as Danish Ali Baig\u00a0: VJ's Lawyer\nTenzin Dalha as Tashi\nDalip Tahil as Lawyer Mirchandani\nKunal Vijaykar as Dr. Roy\u00a0: Nanki's Doctor\nNiki Aneja Walia as Sushma Singh\nManu Rishi as Pratap Singh, Vijay's father\nFahad Ali as Rahul Jha\nRohan Arora as Kerbie\nDeepanshu Titoriya as Deepak\nSahil Mehta as Arnab Mitra\nAshish Khanna as Hardy\u00a0: VJ's friend\nGehna Seth as Professor\nChayan Chopra as KP\nProduction[edit]\nIn June 2019, a report from Filmfare stated Kiara Advani signing a new project for Dharmatic Entertainment, the digital arm of Karan Johar's Dharma Productions, titled Guilty which was helmed by Ruchi Narain.
