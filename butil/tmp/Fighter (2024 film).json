Real life Indian Air Force cadets worked for the film.[6] The film has references to 2019 Pulwama attack, 2019 Balakot airstrike and 2019 India\u2013Pakistan border skirmishes.[7][8] The film seems to be inspired quite a bit by the Top Gun movie, although creating enough difference for Indian audiences[9].

The visual effects are handled by DNEG.\nFighter was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on 30 September 2023 but production delays caused the release date to slip to 25 January 2024, coinciding with the Republic Day weekend.

The team includes Squadron Leaders Shamsher \"Patty\" Pathania, Minal \"Minni\" Rathore, Sartaj \"Taj\" Gill, Basheer \"Bash\" Khan, and Sukhdeep \"Sukhi\" Singh. During training, the team members bond, and Minni develops romantic feelings for Patty. However, Patty is haunted by his past after he lost his fianc\u00e9e in a previous mission. The team learn of an attack on CRPF soldiers in Pulwama, organized by Akhtar.\nIn response, the Indian Air Force, along with RAW agent Zarina Begum, plan a counterattack on Akhtar's base in Balakot. Despite succeeding in the mission, the aftermath causes conflict between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani Air Force launch a retaliatory attack on Indian base as a result. Despite Rocky's orders, Patty, Taj, and Bash cross the Indo-Pakistan border. Taj and Bash's plane is shot down by Pakistani pilots leading to them getting captured. Patty is suspended from the Air Dragons for disobeying orders and is placed as a flying instructor at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad. It is revealed to Minni by Rocky that he holds a grudge against Patty for letting his fianc\u00e9e, Naina Jai Singh  (revealed to be Rocky's younger sister), die in a previous rescue mission.\nThe Pakistani government announce that they will be escorting Taj and Bash safely back to India. However, as the team wait for them to arrive, Sukhi tells Patty that Bash was brutally murdered by Akhtar and have imprisoned a badly injured Taj. Determined to rescue him, Patty defies orders and joins a covert mission. The team successfully infiltrate the enemy territory and Patty is able to rescue Taj and kill Akhtar.
