M. Vetticad gave a positive review and said that the film \"touches upon aspects of sexual violence rarely discussed in Hindi cinema or in Indian society at large.\"[5] Shrikanth Venkatesh of Sify wrote: \"Nail Polish is a gritty film and is gripping for the most part. The acting is generally top notch, with Arjun Rampal and Manav Kaul especially in fine form.[6] Archika Khurana of The Times of India called it a \"a compelling thriller which can be watched for its story and most importantly the outstanding performances.\"[7]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express praised the film and wrote: \"A few things are overstated, a couple of facts are fuzzily presented, but despite the occasional eye-roll, Nail Polish, buoyed by a wonderful performance from Manav Kaul, and ably supported by the rest, keep us engaged.\"[8] Prathyush Parasuraman of Film Companion wrote: \"If nothing else, this movie is a testament to how well-framed and well-acted films can elevate even the banal writing, even if it cannot entirely transcend the banality.\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nNo.TitleSingersLength1.\"Gustakh Mausam\"Vibha Saraf & Ronit Chaterji3:13\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jain, Arushi (8 December 2020). \"Nail Polish trailer: Arjun Rampal and Manav Kaul promise a riveting courtroom drama\".
