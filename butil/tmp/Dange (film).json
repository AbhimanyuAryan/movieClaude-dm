Its biggest strength lies in its fresh appeal and treatment.\"[15]\nDhaval Roy of The Times of India gave 3/5 stars and wrote  \"Despite decent performances and atmosphere, Dange's plot meanders, often losing focus on the point of it all, which makes the direction seem overindulgent.\"[16] Rohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"Dange is enjoyable, but highly recommended for a one-time watch.\"[17] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"There\u2019s a raw energy to Dange. It\u2019s another film celebrating hyper-masculinity, which seems to be the flavour of the season. Watch it for a glimpse of what happens beneath the facade of respectability associated with institutes catering to higher education.\"[18] Rahul Desai of Film Companion wrote \"The craft is so proudly visible in director Bejoy Nambiar\u2019s film that it overwhelms everything else.\"[19]\n\nPor[edit]\nRoopa Radhakrishnan of The Times of India gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"There are a lot of characters and subplots in Por, and it's quite natural that the film isn't able to justify all of them.\"[20] Narayani. M of The New Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"It\u2019s a cinematic rollercoaster ride, and you would want to stand up and clap for its technical brilliance. Yet amidst the exhilarating ride, there\u2019s a lingering sense of disappointment as the narrative fails to rise to the occasion.\"[21] Gopinath Rajendran of The Hindu wrote \"\u2018Por\u2019 features some fascinating ideas, decent performances and looks stylish, but the sub-plots don\u2019t come together cohesively resulting in a predictable drama that\u2019s all over the place.\"[22] Latha Srinivasan of Hindustan Times wrote \"Por is a film that goes down fighting to win over the audience with its youth story. Unfortunately, the story doesn\u2019t have the spunk of Arjun Das nor the fury of Kalidas Jayaram to keep us engaged and invested.\"[23]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Dange (Hindi) (15)\".
