He also started appearing in commercial films, like Shool and Arjun Pandit. However, it was the Academy Award-nominated Lagaan (2001) which brought him to the limelight, and thereafter he appeared in Gangajal (2003) and Ab Tak Chhappan. He has been a regular in films of Shyam Benegal and Prakash Jha and continues to work as a stage actor in Mumbai.[3][5]\nIn 2010, he acted in Rage productions' bilingual play, One on One[6] and the play Lakeerein, written by Gulzar and directed by Salim Arif, opposite actor, Lubna Salim.[7]\nHe made his television debut with Mera Naam Karegi Roshan on Zee TV in 2010.
