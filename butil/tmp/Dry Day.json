(December 2023)\nReception[edit]\nDhaval Roy of The Times of India rated 3 stars out of 5 said The movie was enjoyable at times, but it might have been more captivating. Still, because of its unique vibe and the small-town setting it creates, it is a fun one-time viewing. [7] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV criticises the film and said Jitendra Kumar seems at ease with his surroundings. For him, it ought to have been an easy task. However, the writing gives him a limited number of cliches to work with, so all the part permits him to sell is meaningless babble.[8]\nDeepa Gahlot of Rediff.com gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and said \"Dry Day has an appealing feeling of purpose and honesty.\".[9] Nandini Ramnath write in the Scroll.in that Jitendra Kumar comes to the rescue with a character that first captures the audience's attention but ultimately loses it, much like the film itself. He does this by using his talent at portraying obdurate, cussed males.[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Dry Day (15)\". British Board of Film Classification. 18 December 2023.
