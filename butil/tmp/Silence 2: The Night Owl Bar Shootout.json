It is the sequel to Silence...Can You Hear It? (2021).[1][2]\nThe film was released on ZEE5 on 16 April 2024.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nACP Avinash Verma and his team are assigned a case of a mass shootout that happened as a club named Night Owl Bar in Mumbai. As the team works on the case they realise there is something much bigger and darker at play.\n\nCast[edit]\nManoj Bajpayee as ACP Avinash Verma\nPrachi Desai as Inspector Sanjana Bhatia[3]\nParul Gulati as Aarti\nSahil Vaid\nVaquar Shaikh\nAnkit Bhardwaj\nSujata Mogal\nShruti Bapna\nProduction[edit]\nShoots of Silence 2 commenced in South Mumbai in July 2023.[4][5] They wrapped up shoots in February 2024.[6]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nThe film was formally announced by ZEE5 in March 2023 when the teaser was released.[7][8] The trailer of the film was released on April 3, 2024.[9]\nAs a part of the promotions of the film, Manoj Bajpayee hit the streets of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.[10][11]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was released on the streaming platform ZEE5 on 16 April 2024.[9]\n\nReception[edit]\nA critic from The Times of India rated the film three out of five stars and wrote that \"Overall, in an otherwise average thriller, it is Manoj Bapayee who powers through his solid, assured act\".[12] A critic from News18 gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"Silence 2 definitely deserves a watch if you like murder mysteries. And as always, Manoj Bajpayee is at his finest. It\u2019s worth a watch despite the flaws\".[13] A critic from TimesNow gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"there was real potential and promise in Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout to build something interesting. But the red herrings grow tiresome and the final reveal, in which the antagonist basically reveal all their intentions, drags the story and the film by a good 20 minutes or so\".[14]\nA critic from Pinkvilla rated the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Silence 2 is a long and tiring watch that simply fails to connect. The performances also fail to match the level of a no-nonsense investigative-thriller\".[15] A critic from Outlook rated the film one-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that \"The only good part about Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout is the camera work. The camera work is smooth, and it keeps your attention in this poorly written whodunit\".[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Sequel of Manoj Bajpayee's 'Silence' announced\".
