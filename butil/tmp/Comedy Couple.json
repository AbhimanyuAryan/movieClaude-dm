Zoya is a level-headed girl who is very much in love with Deep but is easily irked by certain traits of his. Together they are a laugh riot on stage, cracking jokes on relationship issues while dealing with them off stage. \nTheir professional and personal lives collide in the backdrop of a comedy act that goes viral. They are helped by Siddhu - the couple\u2019s talent manager and Bala -their broker to navigate their crazy ride.\n[4][5]\n\nCast[edit]\nSaqib Saleem as Deep Sharma\nShweta Basu Prasad as Zoya Batra\nJasmeet Singh Bhatia as Timmy\nSubha Rajput as Aditi\nAadar Malik as Rohan\nPranay Manchanda as Siddhu\nMadhu Sachdeva as Neeta\nRaaz Khanna\nRajesh Tailang as Mukesh Sharma\nPooja Bedi as Zohra Batra\nAnubhav Singh Bassi as himself (Cameo)\nRelease[edit]\nComedy Couple  was premiered through ZEE5 on 21 October 2020.[6]\n\nMusic[edit]\nThe film's music was composed by Tanmaya Bhatnagar and Reuksh Alagh while lyrics written by Tanmaya Bhatnagar.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Kya Yeh Tumhe Pata Hai?\"Tanmaya BhatnagarTanmaya Bhatnagar, Reuksh AlaghTanmaya Bhatnagar, Reuksh Alagh3:20\nReception[edit]\nAnna MM Vetticad from Firstpost gave 2.5 rating out of 5 and wrote \u201cComedy Couple bravely picks several relevant subjects to cover: social conservatism, freedom of expression, religious bigotry, violent fundamentalism, media sensationalism and more. A pity then that its initially fun and fresh tone gives way to an ultimately superficial take on its primary area of focus: unmarriagehood in Gurgaon\u201d[7] Anvita Singh from The Indian Express \u201cThe blend of romance, comedy and lies is not novel, but at least it has some potential, which is fully realised towards the fag end of the movie. It is then that we see characters truly coming into their own, tackling their fears, trying to resolve a central conflict and even evoking some laughter in the process\u201d[8]\nSoumya Srivastava from Hindustan Times stated \u201cSaqib Saleem and Shweta Basu Prasad star in Nachiket Samant\u2019s film about a couple in Gurugram who are trying to make it big in the comedy world. The film, while brave in a few choices it makes, is marred by unimpressive writing and performances\u201d[9]  Tiasa Bhowal from India Today shared her review \u201cComedy Couple gets really monotonous and Nachiket Samant does very little to lift it. The real downer is that even though the film is based on the life of two stand-up comedians, the jokes in the film are not even funny\u201d[10]\nThe Scroll stated \u201cThe movie is salvaged by excellent chemistry between and sincere performances by Saqib Saleem and Shweta Basu Prasad. They have a sweet and believable vibe going, and in a film with less lazy writing and better gags, their efforts would have actually amounted to something\u201d[11] Pallabi Dey Purkayastha form Times Of India wrote \u201cComedy Couple is your typical Bollywood rom-com with a fresh pair and even fresher central theme. Look the other way if you are pining to witness innovation in this genre, stay if you are in it only for the laughs\u201d[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Comedy Couple trailer: Saqib Saleem, Shweta Basu Prasad star in easy-breezy rom-com\".
