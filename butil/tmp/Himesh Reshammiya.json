He started his career as a music director in the film Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya in 1998 and made his acting debut with the film Aap Kaa Surroor in 2007.[3]\n\n\nEarly and personal life[edit]\nHimesh Reshammiya was born in Mumbai to Vipin Reshammiya, an Indian music composer, and Madhu Reshammiya, on 23 July 1973. At the age of 21, Reshammiya married Komal and they have a son named Swaym.[4]\nOn 12 September 2016, it was reported that Himesh and Komal mutually agreed to separate and file for divorce.[5] On 11 May 2018, Himesh married his long-time girlfriend, actress Sonia Kapoor.[6][7]\n\nMusic and film career[edit]\nEarly career (1998\u20132002)[edit]\nReshammiya began producing TV series such as Andaz, Ahha, Aman, Aashiqui, Amar Prem and Jaan on Zee TV.

In 1998, Reshammiya made his debut as a music composer with the Salman Khan film Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, composing two songs for the project: \"Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya\" and \"Tum Par Hum Hai Aatke\". Both songs became hits.[9][10]\nHe went on to compose music for Bandhan and Hello Brother, together with other composers.

In 2009, Vaishali Mhade, a female contestant from his Jai Mata Di Let's Rock Gharana group, won the singing competition. He is also the team captain, judge, and mentor on Star Plus's show Music Ka Maha Muqqabla for the team Himesh's Warriors. Reshammiya was also the judge of the musical reality show Sur Kshetra, which was telecasted on Sahara One. He appeared as the special guest in the Grand Finale of Jo Jeeta Wohi Superstar 2, where he also trained the top four contestants.[17]\n\n2011\u20132020[edit]\nOn 4 November 2013, it was announced that Reshammiya would be acting in and producing a movie named The Xpos\u00e9.[18]\nIn April 2019, it was confirmed that Reshammiya would be back onscreen with the film Namastey Rome, which is a sequel to Namastey London and Namastey England. He also collaborated with lyricist Javed Akhtar in the film's soundtrack, as they had worked together on Namastey London.[19] Reshammiya also acted in three other projects, one being a sequel of The Xpos\u00e9, named The Xpos\u00e9 Returns.[20] Reshammiya also confirmed that he would make a biopic about the soldier Bishnu Shrestha; the film would be based on his involvement in the Maurya Express train robbery.[21][22]\n\n2021\u2013present[edit]\nReshammiya with Akshay Kumar during the Song launch event of the film Raksha Bandhan (2022)\nOn 5 June 2021, Reshammiya launched his music label Himesh Reshammiya Melodies and announced his upcoming studio album \"Surroor 2021\", the second album of the Surroor franchise to be released after 2006.[citation needed] The title track of the album \"Surroor Tera\" was released on 11 June 2021,[23] which followed by the announcement of two new albums under the label Himesh Reshammiya Melodies, namely \"Moods with Melodies\"[24] and \"Himesh Ke Dil Se\".[25] Later in August, Reshammiya announced another album Super Sitaara, which will feature prominent singers from 90's era like Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik and lyricist Sameer.[26] Surroor 2021 The Album garnered more than 6 billion views across YouTube and more than 1.5 billion audio streams on various platforms.[27] More than 500 videos have been released by Himesh Reshammiya Melodies music label on its YouTube Channel till date, which has garnered 21 billion video streams across YouTube and 10 billion audio streams across various audio streaming platforms, making it one of the popular music labels in recent times. \nIn 2022, he composed all the songs for Anand L.

D. Burman also sang through his nose. After this comment, Asha Bhosle, legendary singer and wife of Burman, said, \"If anyone says Burman sa'ab sang through his nose, he should be slapped\". Reshammiya subsequently clarified that he never intended to insult R. D. Burman.[30][31]\nIn his debut film as an actor, Aap Kaa Surroor, Reshammiya added the song \"Tanhaiyyan\" from Boney Kapoor's proposed film Milenge Milenge.[when?][32] Initially, Reshammiya had composed the song for Kapoor's film, but later decided to use it for his own movie. Tips, which held the audio rights of Milenge Milenge, accused Reshammiya of copyright violation, as audio rights for \"Aap Kaa Surroor \u2013 The Real Luv Story\" were acquired by T-Series.[33] However, Reshammiya defended himself, saying that he had made Kapoor listen to the song, but it was not included in Milenge Milenge. He also claimed to have tried to get in touch with Kapoor for seven months, and since there was no progress on the film, he decided to use the song for his own movie.[34]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Himesh Reshammiya\nReshammiya won the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer in 2006 for Aashiq Banaya Aapne, as well as receiving several other awards such as the Star Screen Award, IIFA Award, and the Zee Cine Award.[13] He also received several nominations for his music direction.
