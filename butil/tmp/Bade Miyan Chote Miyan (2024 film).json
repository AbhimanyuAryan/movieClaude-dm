The film stars Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff in the titular roles with Prithviraj Sukumaran as the antagonist. It also features Manushi Chhillar, Alaya F, Sonakshi Sinha and Ronit Bose Roy in pivotal roles. The film follows two former soldiers who reunite and race against time to save India from an imminent attack orchestrated by a vengeful mad scientist.\nThe film was announced in February 2022. Principal photography began in January 2023 and ended by February 2024 with filming held in Mumbai, Scotland, London, Luton, Abu Dhabi, and Jordan. The soundtrack is composed by Vishal Mishra, while Julius Packiam gave the background score, with Marcin Laskawiec as the cinematographer and Steven H. Bernard as the editor. The visual effects are handled by DNEG.\nBade Miyan Chote Miyan was theatrically released on 11 April 2024, coinciding with Eid. The film was met with mixed to negative reviews.\n\n\nPlot\nAn Indian convoy carrying a deadly weapon is ambushed and the soldiers guarding it are killed in the process. The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and  they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker. Misha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission.\nMisha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Just as the team is cornered and nearly defeated, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. Pam unlocks the vault and it is revealed that the package is actually a woman named Priya, who was once engaged to Freddy. Since the hard drives were at the risk of being hacked or falling into wrong hands, the codes to a highly advanced defense system named Karan Kavach were encrypted inside Priya's brain. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones.\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatized and vengeful. \nBack to present, Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. The duo manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode. Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using \"Eklavya\", the name of Kabir's own clone. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive.\n\nCast\n\nAkshay Kumar as Captain Firoz \"Freddy\"\nTiger Shroff as Captain Rakesh \"Rocky\"\nPrithviraj Sukumaran as Dr. Kabir / Eklavya\nManushi Chhillar as Captain Misha\nAlaya F as IT Specialist Dr. Parminder Bawa \u201cPam\u201d\nSonakshi Sinha as Captain Priya Dixit\nRonit Bose Roy as Colonel Adil Shekhar Azad\nManish Chaudhari as General Karan Shergill\nShahab Ali as Captain Vikram\nPawan Chopra as Indian Defence Secretary\nKhalid Siddiqui as Indian Ambassador\nKinnar Boruah as Chang\nMustafa Aksari as Bashir\nNyorika Bhatheja as High Commissioner's wife\nVidhaan Sharma as High Commissioner's son\nRohed Khan as Head Militant\nBijay Anand as Jamaluddin\nOmna Harjani as Agent\nTrisha Bisht as Little Girl\nSapan Chaudhary as Little Girl's father\nNeelam Khanna as Little Girl's mother\nRoshan Shanbagh as Mr. Naved\nMark Chiu as Mr. Wong\nAnay Prasad as Scientist\nSenora Dmello as Hindi Reporter\nJordan Turk as English Reporter\nBo Wang as Chinese Reporter\nZina Ida as Russian Reporter\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn December 2021, Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff were signed for Ali Abbas Zafar's next action film under the production of Pooja Entertainment, which also backed the 1998 film of the same name.[6] Eventually, the film was announced on 8 February 2022.[7] Zafar, apart from being the writer and director, also co-produced it under his own banner, AAZ Films.\n\nCasting\nManushi Chhillar was signed to play an action-packed role, reuniting with Kumar after Samrat Prithviraj (2022).[8][9] In December 2022, Prithviraj Sukumaran was roped in to play the main antagonist named Kabir.[10] Sonakshi Sinha was cast in March 2023.[11][12] Prior to that, Alaya F and Ronit Roy joined the film in January 2023.[13]\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on 17 January 2023 at Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[14] The first schedule included an action scene shot in a set of Bunker before it moved to Film City where other action scenes were shot.

Gupta further wrote \"If only the film had fully embraced its cartoonish qualities, it may have become enjoyable.\"[49]\nSukanya Verma of Rediff.com rated 1/5 stars and observed \"Forget comic chops, you'll not find an ounce of camaraderie between Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff as they go about firing ammo and flexing abs at a zombie-like army for nearly three excruciating hours of this noisy drivel.\"[50]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times stated that \"For those with a penchant for action films, good, bad or ugly, BMCM will definitely make for a one-time watch. If nothing else, Akshay and Tiger's onscreen camaraderie and bromance is quite impressive, and it translates well from real to reel.\"[51]\nZinia Bandyopadhyay of India Today opined that \"If you are in a state where your cognitive abilities are compromised, and you just want to see a lot of \u2018maar-dhaar\u2019(action) that makes no sense at all, then you may consider going for this one.\"[52]\nRonak Kotecha of Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, writing \"Director Ali Abbas Zafar, who is known for giving explosive entertainers like the Tiger series, once again displays his expertise in the genre. Bade Miyan Chote Miyan goes out all guns blazing to make for an entertaining potboiler with heart-pounding action, cheeky humour and barely a dull moment.\"[53]\nTitas Chowdhury of News18 awarded the movie 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that \"To be honest, it would be wrong to call Bade Miyan Chote Miyan just an action entertainer.\"[54]\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in praised director Zafar's work and stated \"Zafar also has a credit for creating the characters. It\u2019s brave, to say the least, given how derivative the movie is.\"[55]\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Exclusive: Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, and Prithviraj reunite to shoot for 3 songs of Bade Miyan Chote Miyan in January\".
