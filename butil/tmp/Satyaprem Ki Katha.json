Unlike other houses,his mother and sister are the earning member in their house so he and his father are both unemployed so they are tasked to do all the household chores. Sattu is frustrated as he is the only remaining bachelor in his neighbourhood .The last bachelor of his neighbour is also getting married inspite of being several years younger than Sattu.After many requests also,his mother declines to find a bride for him giving the reason that no girl will marry a jobless boy like him.But his mother is busy in finding a groom for her daughter,which left Sattu in jealousy.Both his mother and sister misbehave with him and it was only his father who understand his feelings.Sattu informs his father that he is still in love with the girl who he had seen a few years ago at the Garba.\nA flashback occurs which shows in a garba celebration, Sattu gets mesmerized on seeing the dance of a girl named Katha. However, he is heartbroken on learning that she is already in a relationship with a man named Tapan. \nOne year later, Sattu gets to know that Katha has broken up with Tapan and that her parents are looking for a suitable marriage alliance. He visits the Garba celebration again with his father, Narayan, hoping to see Katha's dance again. There they meet Katha's father, Harikishen, a wealthy businessman who owns a popular snack shop, along with her mother and her younger sister, Kinjal. He learns from them that Katha is sick, and after some persuasion from Narayan, he goes to see her at her home. Upon arriving, he is shocked to see that she tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrist. He rushes her to the hospital immediately. Katha recovers, but is angry at Sattu for saving her. When Katha's family arrives at the hospital, Harikishen scolds her, saying that she should have rather died. Later that night, Katha thanks Sattu for saving her life through a text message. The next day, Sattu visits Katha to gift her flowers and to make sure she is doing well.\nA few days pass, and Katha's parents bring a marriage proposal for Katha to Sattu's house. Sattu becomes overjoyed and accepts the alliance. Katha, on the other hand, is unhappy, but reluctantly agrees to the marriage as Harikishen threatens to kill himself if she does not get married. After the marriage, Sattu tries to get intimate with Katha but she is not interested in getting intimate at all and is uncomfortable with sharing the same bed with Sattu, saying that his snoring disturbs her sleep. This results in Sattu having to sleep separately and tries various remedies to fix his snoring problem. One night, Sattu angrily lashes out at her, and questions if she is really uncomfortable with his snoring or if that is just an excuse to not be intimate with him. Katha admits she was lying, and tells him that she is asexual and does not feel the desire to have sex or get intimate, leaving Sattu shocked.\nFrustrated, Sattu tells Harikishen the next day that if the situation does not improve, he will end the marriage and get a divorce. Harikishen advises him to give her some more time to warm up to him and that Sattu should try to make her feel comfortable. Following the advice, Sattu tries to win her affection. He buys her gifts and takes her out on dates. Their relationship improves and Katha reveals that she had lied about being asexual, but that she doesn't feel comfortable explaining the real reason why she doesn't want to sleep with Sattu. Sattu understands, reiterating that he will be there for her regardless. She also encourages him to attempt the law examination again. One night, Katha and Sattu finally try and get intimate, but it results in Katha having an emotional breakdown, due to a past trauma.\nIt is revealed that Tapan had raped Katha the previous year after the Garba celebration. She had become pregnant and had to get an abortion. Katha's family never told anyone of the incident, fearing the shame it would bring for them in the society, and had disowned Katha. Due to all this, Katha is not comfortable in being intimate with anyone. Sattu is furious on learning all this and confronts Harikishen regarding the matter. He then heads to Tapan's workplace and brutally thrashes him. Sattu's family is also left in shock after knowing everything but decide to keep the matter among themselves. Later, Sattu and Katha leave for Kashmir for their honeymoon, now more deeply in love with each other. Katha is still unable to get intimate with Sattu, due to her trauma. Sattu understand and gives her the space to cope with her past.\nOn the day of Satyanarayan Puja at Katha's house, Sattu arrives after registering an FIR against Tapan. Sattu brings the papers to Katha to sign them, encouraging her to fight for herself. With renewed hope and love for each other, Sattu and Katha perform the puja together and start their fight against Tapan in the court. Sattu finally obtains his law degree, while Katha starts healing slowly with Sattu's constant support.\n\nCast[edit]\nKartik Aaryan as Satyaprem \"Sattu\" Narayan, Katha's husband, Narayan and Diwali's son and Sejal's brother\nKiara Advani as Katha Kapadia, Sattu's wife, Harikishen and Rasna's daughter and Kinjal's sister\nGajraj Rao as Narayan, Sattu's father\nSupriya Pathak as Diwali, Sattu's mother\nSiddharth Randeria as Harikishen Kapadia, Katha's father\nAnuradha Patel as Rasna Kapadia, Katha's mother\nRajpal Yadav as Doodhiya\nShikha Talsania as Sejal, Sattu's sister\nArjun Aneja as Tapan Manek, Katha's ex-boyfriend and rapist\nMaira Doshi as Kinjal Kapadia, Katha's sister\nNirmiti Sawant as Christmas, Diwali's elder sister\nBhaumik Ahir as Chandresh\nPalash Tiwari as Dheeraj, Kinjal's fianc\u00e9\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe film was officially announced with a motion poster on 23 June 2021 by Sajid Nadiadwala, to be directed by Sameer Vidwans and starring Kartik Aaryan.
