We have shot at very difficult locations and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the relentless efforts made by the team of studio and the production! It was a real privilege to work on this one, now that our film made it to the likes of Film Bazaar, I am quite stoked.[14]\nScreenings[edit]\n\n\nDate\n\nScreening Event\n\nLocation\n\n\nFebruary 2023\nInternational Film Festival Rotterdam[15]\n\nRotterdam,Netherlands\n\n\nJune 2023\n\n70th Sydney Film Festival[16][17]\n\nSydney,Australia\n\n\nJuly 2023\n\nDurban International Film Festival[18][19]\n\nDurban,South Africa\n\n\nOctober 2023\n\n28th Busan International Film Festival[20]\n\nBusan,South Korea\n\n\nOctober 2023\n\n59th Chicago International Film Festival[21]\n\nChicago,USA\n\n\nReception[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 18 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10.[22]\nPhil Hoad of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five, stating, \"In this gritty thriller, director Devashish Makhija skillfully blends social satire with repressive realism to gradually build suspense as a parent struggles to outrun his oppressors\".[23] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV also gave it four stars and wrote, \"Manoj Bajpayee keeps the disturbing movie grounded even if it leaves viewers in disbelief. He fully gives himself over to Dasru Kerketta, fusing the agony of the defenseless with the wrath of the unfortunate. Joram isn't supposed to be amusing, it is engrossing from beginning to end\".[24] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the production 2.5 stars out of five and said in her review that Bajpayee is effective, yet his register of hopelessness and horror is restricted.[25] Dhaval Roy of The Times of India gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, \"Joram is a grim story that you will remember for a very long time. It deviates from being a survival drama since the socio-political aspect dominates the tale, but its powerful performances and storyline make it worth seeing\".[26] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times said in her review that Joram will only appeal to a very specific demographic because, while being a compelling narrative about institutional imbalance and more, it never quite gains the velocity necessary to keep readers interested.[27]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n28 January 2024\n\nBest Film (Critics)\n\nDevashish Makhija\n\nWon\n\n[11][28]\n\n\nBest Actor (Critics)\n\nManoj Bajpayee\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Story\n\nDevashish Makhija\n\nWon\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Manoj Bajpayee's 'Joram' to release on December 8\".
