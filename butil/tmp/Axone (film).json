The film stars Sayani Gupta, Vinay Pathak, Lin Laishram, Dolly Ahluwalia, Adil Hussain, Lanuakum Ao, Tenzin Dalha, and Rohan Joshi. The film follows Northeast Indian migrants in New Delhi, in their attempt to organize a wedding party.[3] The film premiered at the London Film Festival on 2 October 2019.[4]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe story tells of a group of migrants from Northeast India to Delhi, Upasana, Chanbi, and Zorem, who are trying to help their friend Minam with her wedding preparations. Minam, who shares a flat with Upasana, Chanbi, and others from their region, is called away suddenly for an interview. Meanwhile, her friends try to find an ingredient to make 'Axone,' a special dish that they want for the wedding. The friends face various difficulties as they attempt to plan the wedding and prepare Axone. The other tenants object and the landlord's mother-in-law enforces her rule against parties or spicy cooking in the flat. They decide to hold the wedding at Chanbi's boyfriend Bendang's flat, but finding a way to cook Axone without drawing the attention of locals brings comical problems.\nShiv, the landlord's son, and a friend of Zorem, lends his hand. His girlfriend breaks up with him when she sees him with Upasana, and later with Chanbi. As the wedding hour nears, the friends are discouraged at the thought of failing Minam (who has not yet returned). Zorem finally resolves to cook Axone on Upasana's landlord's terrace, and receives the landlord's permission in spite of his mother-in-law. The friends manage to prepare the Axone just in time for the wedding.\nThe marriage commences with Minam initiating a video conference with her groom and family from her hometown with Minam\u2019s sister standing in for her, which the friends had not realized. After the ceremony, Zorem proposes to Upasana, and Chanbi decides to go back to her hometown with Bendang. In the meantime, Bendang reconciles with a racist incident from his past. In the end, the friends indulge in Axone, while Shiv laments not being able to find any mainland Indian cuisine.\n\nCast[edit]\nSayani Gupta as Upasana\nLin Laishram as Chanbi\nLanuakum Ao as Bendang\nRohan Joshi as Shiv\nMerenla Imsong as Balamon\nTenzin Dalha as Zorem\nAsenla Jamir as Minam\nDolly Ahluwalia as Nani, Landlord mother\nVinay Pathak as Landlord\nSamit Gambhir as Rakesh (eve teaser), Supporting/ Guest Appearance\nEliel R Famhoite as Lalrempui\nMilo Sunka as Hayna\nAakash Bhardwaj as Hironya\nDeepansha Dhingra as Shiv's Girlfriend\nJimpa Bhutia as Bunty\nPallavi Batra as Secretary's Daughter-in-Law\nVijay Kumar Dogra as Rowdy neighbor\nAdil Hussain as the man outside Zorem shop (Special appearance).\nProduction[edit]\nThe film took 25 days to shoot on locations in New Delhi.[5]\n\nRelease[edit]\nThe film premiered at the London Film Festival on 2 October 2019 and made its debut in India at the Mumbai Film Festival (MAMI) on 19 October 2019.[5] The film was released on Netflix on 12 June 2020.[1]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nAxoneSoundtrack album by Papon, M.
