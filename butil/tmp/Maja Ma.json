This knotty moral conundrum that Pallavi must confront as a personal journey, is the highlight of a film that can often oscillate between massy tropes and meaningful depths.\"[10] Shweta Keshri from India Today gave Maja Ma a rating of 2/5 and wrote, \"Madhuri Dixit carries the film on her shoulders and Gajraj Rao delivers a flawless performance. The film dealt with the topic sensitively and not made a mockery of it. However, the film's ending is disappointing\".[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Entertainment Desk (28 April 2022). \"Maja Maa first look: Madhuri Dixit plays a 'warm, loving mother' in this Anand Tiwari dramedy\".
