It's significant because their support isn't based on 'andh bhakti' (blind devotion), but leadership that encourages questions\".[12]\nNDTV's Saibal Chatterjee rated the film 2.5 out of 5, opining in his review that, \"Ae Watan Mere Watan makes its points with clarity and directness. It tells a tale that has meat, but the storytelling style that the film adopts stops it significantly short of being either consistently riveting or memorably rousing\". He critized the lead performance, opining that, \"Sara Ali Khan, playing the principal character, is way too porcelain and dainty to convey the remarkably doughty woman's fierce determination.\"[13]\nZinia Bandyopadhyay of India Today gave 2/5 stars and wrote that \"Ae Watan Mere Watan drowns in a lacklustre script despite having the potential to be an effective story.\"[14]\nFirstpost's Lachmi Deb Roy, in her review, rated the film 2/5 and said that \"Though the film was able to weave the freedom movement with enough human stories showing Usha\u2019s contribution to the Quit India movement, but  Ae Watan Mere Watan was unable to give us those goosebumps which a freedom movie generally does\".[15] Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express called the film a \"banal blur\". She panned the film, opining that \"nothing about this period drama breaks out of familiar moulds\" and that \"Sara Ali Khan leaves little impact.\" However, she called Sparsh Srivastav the \"breakout star\", praising his performance as a polio-afflicted young freedom fighter.[16]\nTrisha Gaur from Koimoi rated the film a 3.5/5 and said \"When Sara Ali Khan, for the first time, introduces Congress Radio, \u2018Hindustan Mein Kahin Se, Kahin Se Hindustan Mein,\u2019 you absolutely want to root for her\".[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Ae Watan Mere Watan (15)\".
