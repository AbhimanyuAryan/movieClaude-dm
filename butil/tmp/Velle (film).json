It\u2019s only at the interval point when more things happen, and the movie moves into higher gear. And the second half more than makes up for the \u2018vellapanti\u2019-filled first and also keeps you glued to the screen proceedings even though you half-anticipate them.\"[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Velle\".
