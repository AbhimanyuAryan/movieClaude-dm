Rating the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, she wrote, \"Rakul Preet Singh has delivered a perky performance in a film hamstrung by a script that is afraid to fully embrace its message.\"[12]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nChhatriwaliSoundtrack album by Akhil Sachdeva, Rohan-Rohan, Sumeet Bellary and Durgesh R RajbhattReleased13 January 2023[13]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength14:25LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanyOfficial audioChhatriwali - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe music for the film composed by Akhil Sachdeva, Rohan-Rohan, Sumeet Bellary and Durgesh R Rajbhatt.
