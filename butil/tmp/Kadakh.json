The film, directed by Kapoor, is set on a night of Deepawali celebration when a Mumbai based couple organise a party at their home only to face bizarre circumstances during the whole night.[6]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nSunil is preparing for a Diwali party at his house. Some hours before the party he is visited by a stranger named Raghav, who introduces himself as husband of Sunil's colleague Chaya. Sunil is having an extramarital affair with Chaya and Raghav knows about that. Sunil and Raghav have an argument, during which Raghav accidentally shoots and kills himself with a gun. Before Sunil could do much to hide the body, his wife Malti returns from the office. Sunil tells her about the incident and while they're discussing what they should do, guests of the party start arriving. Having no way out, they hide the body and welcome the friends. Among the set of friends, there is Francoise Marie, who is a thought reader, a single mom named Paro and Joshi who is cooking for everyone in the party. There are unannounced guests as well, who are Malti's uncle and her aunt, Sunil's friend Rahul, Rahul's wife Sheetal, Yogesh and his wife Alka and Sunil's office colleagues and Chaya too; very soon the whole house is filled with people. What unfolds next is the hidden rivalry between friends, drunken brawls, game of cards and several twists and turns finally resulting in soiled friendships and ruined relationships.[7][8][9]\n\nCast[edit]\nRanvir Shorey as Sunil[10]\nMansi Multani as Maalti\nPalomi Ghosh as Chhaya\nChandrchoor Rai as Raaghav\nRajat Kapoor as Rahul\nKalki Koechlin as Francoise Marie\nShruti Seth as Alka\nNupur Asthana as Paaro\nSagar Deshmukh as Joshi\nTara Sharma as Sheetal (as Tara Sharma Saluja)\nCyrus Sahukar[11][12] as Yogesh\nSheena Khalid as Sheena\nKaizaad Kotwal as Kaizaad\nKrishna Raaz as Radha\nMinty Tejpal as Minty\nManoj Pahwa as Maalti's Chacha\nYamini Das as Maalti's chachi\nBrijesh Karanwal as Watchman\nProduction[edit]\nThe film was shot on a single location.
