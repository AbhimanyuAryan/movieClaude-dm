They ride beyond the limits of their lives and to the heights of freedom.\n\nCast[edit]\nRatna Pathak Shah as Manpreet Kaur Sethi \"Mahi\"\nDia Mirza as Uzma\nFatima Sana Shaikh as Shashi Kumar Yadav \"Sky\"\nSanjana Sanghi as Manjari alias \"Lali\"\nHrriday Malhotra as Nishant Kakkar\nHarshpal Singh as Prabjyot \"Prabhi\", Mahi's grandson and Sky's friend\nDheerendra Dwivedi as Shabbir, Uzma's husband\nKallirroi Tziafeta as Martha\nOzgur Kurt as Bernett\nPoonam Gurung as Kung Fu Nun\nProduction[edit]\nIn May 2022, the film was announced by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and stars Ratna Pathak Shah, Dia Mirza, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanjana Sanghi.[6][7] The principal photography of the film began in May 2022.[8] The filming took place in Greater Noida, New Delhi,[9] followed by Manali, Himachal Pradesh[10] before moving on to Leh, Ladakh,[11] and it was shot across 83 locations.[12] The filming was completed in 40 days and wrapped up in June 2022.[13]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nDhak DhakSoundtrack album by Jasmine Sandlas, Rishi Dutta, Osho Jain, Mohan Kannan, Anurag Saikia, Raghav & ArjunReleased13\u00a0October\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-10-13)[14]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength27:55LanguageHindiLabelZee Music CompanySingles from  Dhak Dhak \n\"Dhak Dhak - Title Track (Re Banjara)\"Released: 6 October 2023[15]\n\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Akhiyan Criminal\"Jasmine SandlasJasmine SandlasJasmine Sandlas3:012.\"Dhak Dhak - Title Track (Re Banjara)\"Kundan Vidyarthi, Baba Bulleh ShahRishi DuttaSunidhi Chauhan, Jatinder Singh3:533.\"Sadke Sadke\"Osho JainOsho JainRashmeet Kaur2:284.\"Miltay Hain Na\"Mohan KannanMohan Kannan, Aditya PushkarnaMohan Kannan3:575.\"Safar Pe Chale\"Avinash ChouhanAnurag SaikiaAmit Trivedi3:146.\"Woh Tara\"Raghav, ArjunRaghav, ArjunShannon Donald, Shashaa Tirupati3:487.\"Udd Udd\"Gurpreet SainiShruti PathakShruti Pathak3:008.\"Farzi Duniya\"Kundan VidyarthiRishi DuttaShruti Pathak, Shivangi Bhayana4:34Total length:27:55\nReception[edit]\nReviewing the movie, Sajesh Mohan of Onmanorama wrote, \"embarking on a journey to Khardung La on Royal Enfield Bullets is a promise of adventure in itself. Yet, director Tarun Dudeja, in his debut film, takes it a step further by forming an all-women biker gang. This ride turns into an unforgettable pilgrimage with the charming and evergreen Ratna Pathak Shah as Mahi, Dia Mirza as Uzma, Fatima Sana Shaikh as Sky, and Sanjana Sanghi as Manjari. Tarun, collaborating with co-writer Parijat Joshi, assembles this group of riders from the bustling streets of Delhi. It's a world where the trials and tribulations of Mahi, Uzma, Sky, and Manjari all converge on a single theme\u2014the experience of being women in a prejudiced and predatory patriarchal society.\"[16] A critic from Bollywood Hungama rated the film 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Dhak Dhak is a well-intentioned genuine effort laced with some fine performances by the leading ladies. But due to a weak second half and negligible buzz, the film will suffer at the box office.\"[17]\nIn a less positive review, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote \"The Ratna Pathak Shah, Dia Mirza starrer is a patchy effort.\" But she added, \"Dhak Dhak\u2019 starts off with many of the expected tropes playing out in a movie of this kind. Very different women, from different walks of life. Troubled past. Conflicted present. All looking for a way out, a way forward. Bumps on the road. Breakdowns of men and machines. And finally, that most elusive, precious element, the connection which binds us despite our differences.\"[18]\nIn a slightly negative review, Prathyush Parasuraman of Film Companion said, \"Road Trip to Nowhere\" with \"inane and predictable\" plot elements in the second half.[19]\n\nSequel[edit]\nA sequel Dhak Dhak 2, has been confirmed by actress Sanjana Sanghi, who played the character of Manjari. Sanjana shared the news on her social media.[20]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAward\n\nCeremony date\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n28 January 2024\n\nBest Actress (Critics)\n\nFatima Sana Shaikh\n\nNominated\n\n[21]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nRatna Pathak Shah\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Story\n\nParijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Debut Director\n\nTarun Dudeja\n\nWon\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Dhak Dhak (15)\".
