A remake of the 2020 Telugu-language film Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, it stars Kartik Aaryan in the lead role who also makes his production debut with the film. Kriti Sanon, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala and Ronit Roy appear in key roles.\nPrincipal photography began in October 2021 and ended in January 2023 with filming held in Mumbai, Mauritius and Delhi. The film score and soundtrack album are composed by Pritam. Shehzada was released theatrically on 17 February 2023.[5] The film received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure.[6]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nValmiki and Randeep start their career as clerks in the company of Aditya Jindal. Randeep, who marries Jindal's daughter Yashoda \"Yashu\", becomes wealthy while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both their children, Randeep's son appears to be dead. When nurse Sulochana informs Valmiki about this, he pities Randeep and offers to exchange his baby with the dead one since the Jindals have done so much for him.\nAfter switching them, however, Randeep's child begins to cry, having not died after all. Valmiki, sensing that his son would have a better life growing up in a rich family, prevents Sulochana from switching the babies back and accidentally pushes her off a ledge. Sulochana goes into a coma, keeping Valmiki's secret from coming out.\n25 years later, Raj, raised at Jindal's house, is timid and innocent while Bantu, raised by Valmiki, is street-smart and outspoken. Valmiki, who favours his own son Raj, treats Bantu badly. Bantu gets a job at a law firm headed by Samara, who is impressed by his knowledge and quick-wittedness. Meanwhile, Raj returns from his studies abroad. Jindal sends Raj to reject Sarang, a powerful man who offers to buy their company's shares but deals with drugs. Randeep watches the deal from a restaurant where Samara has a meeting. When the client misbehaves with Samara, Bantu interferes. Randeep is disappointed by Raj's inability to say no to Sarang but beams at Bantu and Samara when they defend themselves against the rowdy client. Following this, Raj becomes engaged to Samara but she and Bantu have fallen in love.\nSarang attempts to kill Randeep for getting in his way. Bantu saves Randeep; at the hospital, he meets Sulochana, who has come out of her coma. She reveals Bantu's true parentage before dying. Bantu denounces Valmiki as his father. Aditya Jindal, Bantu's true grandfather, is fond of Bantu for saving Randeep and hires him.\nBantu begins to address the issues plaguing the house by patching up Randeep relationship with Yashu, which had been strained since Randeep's affair seven years ago. He also settles the dispute with Sarang and reforms the corrupt family members, Kailash and Arun. He and Samara tell Raj about their relationship; Raj calls off his marriage with Samara and confronts his parents, telling them he should be allowed to make his own decisions rather than have everything handed to him. Sarang kidnaps Yashu and threatens to kill her unless Randeep gives him money.\nBantu saves Yashu. Jindal reveals that he knew all along who Bantu was, which is why he brought him home; he had overheard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. Bantu unites with Randeep but asks him not to reveal the truth to Yashu, fearing she might be disheartened to know that Raj, who she dotes on so much, is not her real child. Yashu remarks that Bantu is like her son, as he saved her and the family. Yashu asks Valmiki to train Raj to be as competent as Bantu and become the CEO of their company. Bantu forgives Valmiki and mends his relationship with him.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKartik Aaryan as Bantu Nanda\nKriti Sanon as Samara Singh\nParesh Rawal as Valmiki Upadhyay, Bantu's foster father\nManisha Koirala as Yashoda 'Yashu' Jindal, Bantu's biological mother\nRonit Roy as Randeep Nanda, Bantu's biological father\nRajpal Yadav as Inspector Satish Yadav DP\nSachin Khedekar as Aditya Jindal, Yashu's father and Bantu's biological grandfather.

Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in stated: \"Rehash of Telugu hit is catnip for Kartik Aaryan fans\"[30] Dhaval Roy of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, stating \"With campy humour and action, this is just a mass entertainer\".[31] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV Movies stated: \"Take Kartik Aaryan Out, There Might Not Be Much Left. The obsolescence of the film's essence is difficult to shrug off.\"[32]\nShalini Langer of The Indian Express stated: \"Only Manisha Koirala and Ronit Roy come out of this Kartik Aaryan starrer with some dignity intact. That\u2019s more than can be said about the audience.

The original was extremely loud and over the top, so the remake can hardly be less so.\"[38] Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave 0.5 out of 5 ratings.[39]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kartik Aaryan starrer Shehzada certified 'U/A' by CBFC with duration of 2 hours 25 minutes\".
