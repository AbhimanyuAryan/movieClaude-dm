Critics praised the performances of Tagore, Bajpayee, and Simran. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film giving 4 out of 5 stars and said that \u201cthere is a great deal of beauty in the muted melodrama\u201d, praising the cast\u2019s ensemble performance.[6]\nAlaka Sahani of The Indian Express drew a parallel between Gulmohar and Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding and termed it as director Rahul V Chittella's Tribute to his mentor. [7]\nDhaval Roy, writing for the Times of India, gave the movie 3.5 stars and gave particular praise to the acting performance of the cast stating that Tagore \u201cis par excellence\u201d and that \u201cwhile Manoj is outstanding, so is Simran as his wife, Indu. The duo's individual performances are as noteworthy as their on-screen chemistry as husband and wife\u201d. He highlighted the \u201ccommendable performances\u201d of the rest of the cast. [8]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times was more critical. While she praised the cast\u2019s performance she also stated that \u201cthe film needed much better editing\u201d with certain subplots seeming \u201chalf-baked\u201d.[9]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nNominee / work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2023\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nBest Web Original Film\n\nGulmohar\n\nNominated\n\n[10]\n\n\nBest Director in a Web Original Film\n\nRahul V.
