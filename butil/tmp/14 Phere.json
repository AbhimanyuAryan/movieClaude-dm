However, knowing their parents will disapprove, they hatch a plan to convince them.\n\nCast[edit]\nVikrant Massey as Sanjay Lal Singh a.k.a.

It almost feels like the message is that as long as one can show off an ostentatious display of wealth and dowry, one can hush up about caste- a rather problematic resolution!\"[9] Anita Aikara of Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"14 Phere delivers on the feel-good factor, but if you are looking for ground-breaking humour, it will fail to work its way into your hearts.\"[10] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll gave the film a negative review and criticized the screenplay, performance, the leads, but praised Jameel Khan's performance.[11]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\n14 PhereSoundtrack album by Raajeev V.
