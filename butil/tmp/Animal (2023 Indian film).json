Despite Balbir being a strict father, Vijay's love for his father is deep and abiding. Balbir doesn't know about his son's devotion for him due to his busy schedule, which also keeps him from spending time with his family\nOne day, Balbir expels Vijay to a boarding school in the USA when Vijay threatens the bullies of his elder sister Reet with an AK-47. Vijay finishes his education and returns home after several years. During Balbir's birthday party, Vijay gets into an argument with his brother-in-law Varun, prompting Balbir to expel him from the house again.After his argument with Balbir, Vijay joins the European football club Real Madrid as a center forward. Vijay marries his childhood girlfriend Geetanjali from a Telugu family and the couple cuts ties with their families and moves to the USA.\nEight years later, Vijay, Geetanjali and their two kids return to India upon learning that Balbir had an assassination attempt. After meeting his father, Vijay reconciles with his family and takes it upon himself to uncover the assassin's identity. He rounds up his cousins from the village for backup and recruits a body double for his father, who is eventually killed by a gangster named Asrar Haque. Vijay discovers Varun's role in the assassination attempt and kills him publicly at a conference with his cousins, where Asrar is also present.\nVijay and his cousins meet Freddy, an arms dealer at a hotel where Asrar arrives with his assailants to kill Vijay. Vijay takes them all down with a machine gun and kills Asrar, but gets severely wounded and became bedridden with a damaged sense of hearing. He wakes up after two weeks and undergoes a heart transplant for his failing heart. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Asrar's brother Abrar Haque learns of his death during Abrar's third wedding and kills one of his men publicly at the wedding. Abrar and his other brother Abid go to a house where they shoot the man who was keeping tabs on Asrar revealing Abrar was the one who planned the assassination attempt on Balbir. Vijay recuperates after several months and is approached by Zoya, the fianc\u00e9e of his heart donor. Vijay starts an extramartial affair with Zoya, who eventually reveals that she was sent by Abrar to honey trap him, so that one of his brothers who transformed himself into another Vijay, would kill his family, but Vijay reveals that he had already knew this and played along to learn the mastermind's identity.\nVijay learns from his grandfather Rajdheer Singh that Abrar and his brothers are Vijay's second cousins. They are the grandchildren of Shamsher Singh, Rajdheer's younger brother. Rajdheer had renounced Shamsher for his immoral antics. Shamsher's son Azim, who had converted to Islam and married a couple of times, was denied any share in Balbir's assets, which prompted Shamsher to commit suicide by setting himself on fire. Abrar, who had witnessed his grandfather's suicide, became mute from the trauma. Vijay then reveals to Geethanjali about the affair with Zoya and she becomes depressed and angry at Vijay but the two put aside their differences.\nVijay with his cousins stops Abrar, who is about to escape the country in a private jet with Abid. A violent fistfight ensues on the runway for a couple of hours. Vijay requests Abrar to stop targeting Balbir to which he denies. At the end of the fight Vijay brutally slits Abrar's throat, thereby putting an end to the chapter.\nBack in India during Diwali, Balbir reveals that he has stage 4 ALL with only a few months left to live. He realises that his lack of love for his son has always been the root cause of Vijay's aggression. Balbir finally apologises to Vijay who bitterly cries in the pain of losing his father, the one whom he loved more than anyone. At this time, Geetanjali leaves Vijay for USA with their children, but their son Abhay runs back to Vijay.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Aziz Haque, a butcher in Istanbul and the youngest of the Haque brothers, is revealed as the one who underwent plastic surgery to resemble another Vijay. Zoya and Abid are with him and Zoya is revealed to be pregnant, though unsure whether the child's father is Aziz or Vijay. After butchering two of Vijay's cousins brutally, Aziz sets out with Abid to exact revenge for the deaths of their two elder brothers.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nRanbir Kapoor in a double role as Ranvijay \"Vijay\" Singh Balbir and Aziz Haque\nAhmad Ibn Umar as young Ranvijay\nAnil Kapoor in a double role as Balbir Singh and Kailash Petkar\nBobby Deol as Abrar Haque\nLeon Ung as young Abrar\nRashmika Mandanna as Geetanjali Iyengar Singh Balbir, Ranvijay's wife\nDiyara Valecha as young Geetanjali\nTriptii Dimri as Zoya Ahmed, Aziz's girlfriend\nCharu Shankar as Jyoti Singh, Ranvijay's mother\nShakti Kapoor as PK Mishra, COO of Swastik Steels Corporation\nPrem Chopra as Dalbir Dodamal Singh \"Bade Daji\", Ranvijay's granduncle\nBabloo Prithiveeraj as Asrar Haque, Abrar and Aziz's first brother\nMadhu Raja as Rani Kaur \"Beeji\", Dalbir Singh's wife\nSuresh Oberoi as Rajdheer Dodamal Singh \"Dadaji\", Ranvijay's grandfather\nSaurabh Sachdeva as Abid Haque, Abrar and Aziz's second brother\nSaloni Batra as Reet Singh Malhotra, Ranvijay's elder sister\nNeeven Ved as young Reet\nAnshul Chauhan as Roop Singh, Ranvijay's younger sister\nEva Chibber as young Roop\nSiddhant Karnick as Varun Pratap Malhotra, Reet's husband and Ranvijay's brother-in-law\nMaganti Srinath as Karthik Iyengar, Geetanjali's brother\nUpendra Limaye as Freddy Wilfred Patil\nMathew Varghese as Professor Shreepad Balaji Iyengar, Karthik and Geetanjali's father\nIndira Krishnan as Motika Iyengar, Karthik and Geetanjali's mother\nKunal Thakur as Ahaan, Geetanjali's fianc\u00e9\nMrinmayee Godbole as Dr. Amrita\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nIn September 2019, it was reported that Sandeep Reddy Vanga would turn into a producer for his next directional venture in Bollywood.

The website's consensus reads: \"Overlong, overly violent, and thinly written, Animal goes wildly over the top to little avail.\"[79] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[80]\nAwarding the film 4.5/5 stars, Bollywood Hungama praised \"Ranbir Kapoor\u2019s outstanding performance, clap-worthy massy scenes, and interval block.\"[81] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave 4/5 stars and wrote \"Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way.\"[82] Ganesh Aaglave of Firstpost gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote,\"Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling.\"[83] Puja Awasthi of The Week gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Animal for all its blood and gore, is the story of a son\u2019s aching desire for his father\u2019s approval. Why even its ballads are less romantic, more revenge. And its female characters for all their luminosity, are just props\".[84]\nMonika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times found it \"an absolute massy, entertaining and extremely violent thriller which doesn't believe in conforming to the norms\", while adding that the extreme violence might be off-putting for some.[85] Titas Chowdhury of News18 gave 3.5/5 stars, labelled it \"dark, loud and garish but also unapologetic\", and thought that Ranbir Kapoor \"breathes life into this undesirable character with a lot of charisma and swag\".[86] Abhimanyu Mathur of DNA India rated the film 3.5/5 and opined, \"Animal takes everything that was problematic and increases it several notches. It is downright the most violent Hindi film I have seen, and also one of the most inherently toxic and misogynist. The amazing part is that it is still very well made and entertaining, enhanced further by yet another great performance from Kapoor\".[87]\nConversely, Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India gave 2.5/5 stars and termed the film \"all swag and no substance derailed family drama\"; she was critical of \"Vanga's take on women or violence\" but praised Ranbir's \"raw sex appeal and unmatched intensity\".[88] India Today's Anvita Singh gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Ranbir Kapoor is stellar in problematic, paper-thin film.\"[89] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote \"Ranbir is on fire, inhabiting to a frightening degree Vijay's delusional personal war. Reptile-eyed even at his smoldering best, Kapoor's career-best performance makes Animal tough to stomach, but equally difficult to ignore\".[90]\nIn a negative review, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express expressed disappointment that the performances of Ranbir and Anil Kapoor had been \"wasted in this pointless, vile tale\".[91] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"The sickeningly violent father-son action drama rarely pauses for breath.\"[92] Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote: \"Sandeep Reddy Vanga's film has the kind of writing you'll find in BDSM erotica like Fifty Shades of Grey, but presented with the same earnestness of 'pure love' that we saw in Arjun Reddy.\"[93] Phuong Le of The Guardian gave 1/5 stars and wrote \"Animal sinks even further into regressive depths, resulting in one of the vilest protagonists to have graced the big screen.\"[94][95] Pranati A S of Deccan Herald gave 1/5 stars and wrote \"If you thought Arjun Reddy was toxic, then Animal will rattle your cage.\"[96]\n\nBox office[edit]\nAnimal broke several box-office records for a Hindi film.[97][98][99][100] The film had the fourth-biggest advance
