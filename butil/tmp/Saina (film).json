Based on the life of badminton player Saina Nehwal, the film stars Parineeti Chopra as Nehwal.[3][4] The film was initially set to release in September 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.[5] It was theatrically released on 26 March 2021.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film traces Saina's journey from her training at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad, her struggles, her parents sacrifices for her dreams, her passion for badminton, her relationship with Kashyap and her coach Rajan to her becoming World's No.1.\n\nCast[edit]\nParineeti Chopra as Saina Nehwal\nManav Kaul as Coach Sarvadhamaan Rajan, a fictionalized version of Pullela Gopichand\nEshan Naqvi as Parupalli Kashyap[6]\nMeghna Malik as Usha Rani Nehwal, Saina's mother[7]\nSubhrajyoti Barat  as Harvir Singh Nehwal, Saina's father[7]\nAnkur Vikal as Coach Jeewan Kumar[7]\nTawhid Rike Zaman as Rohan's Friend\nSharrman Dey as Damodar\nSameer Bassi as Rohan\nTaiyaba Mansuri as young Abu Nehwal\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nSaina Nehwal revealing the details of the film, on her Twitter account announced the film on 26 April 2017. Earlier, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play Nehwal's role, and she even started filming in September 2018 after training, but later she opted out of the film due to health issues.[8] On 15 March 2019, it was confirmed by T-Series head honcho Bhushan Kumar that Shraddha Kapoor will not be playing the role of Nehwal. In a statement they said, \"Due to circumstances beyond her control, the actress kept giving other films priority over the national badminton champion\u2019s biopic, so the makers have decided to go ahead with Chopra.\"[9]\nIn June, Manav Kaul was finalized to play the role of Pullela Gopichand who is Nehwal's coach.[10]\n\nTraining[edit]\nFrom mid June, Chopra was training herself in playing badminton and practicing the stances of Nehwal.[11] As many as 12 courts were recreated to represent international venues where Saina Nehwal has played.[12]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nThe film collected total \u20b9 1.2 crore in its theatrical run, it was declared flop and disastrous.[13]\nIt was impacted due to Covid-19.\n\nCritical reception[edit]\nSaina received mixed to positive reviews from critics with praises towards Chopra's performance. Yogesh Mishra of 'Bollywood Town' says \"Movie beautifully talks about the success saga of a middle-class girl from Haryana\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 3 out of 5 stars and noted that Parineeti \"serves, drops and smashes as [the] badminton champ\", writing \"[Chopra] gives us a good, solid Saina Nehwal. When she raises her racket after a hard-fought win, you cheer.\"[14]\nFilm critic Anna M. M. Vetticad applauded Chopra for rising to the challenge of playing the sports icon, writing \"The actor plays down her naturally vivacious personality and sparkling eyes for the not-so-showy character she plays here. Most impressively, she gets the body language of a sportsperson right and actually looks the part on court.\"[15] She gave the film 2.75 star out of 5 and pointed out that the film erases Gopichand and skirts inconvenient truths. \nRenuka Vyavahare of Times Of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Saina is a simple ode to eternal optimism\". For Chopra's performance she said, \"Parineeti push herself in this physically demanding role\".[16]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\n\nAward\n\nDate of the ceremony\n\nCategory\n\nRecipients\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n67th Filmfare Awards\n\n30 August 2022\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nMeghna Malik\n\nNominated\n\n[17]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nManav Kaul\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Music Album\n\nAmaal Malik\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Lyrics\n\nManoj Muntashir\n\nNominated\n\n\n68th National Film Awards\n\n30 September 2022\n\nBest Lyrics\n\nManoj Muntashir\n\nWon\n\n\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nSainaSoundtrack album by Amaal MallikReleased26 March 2021[18]Recorded2020GenreFeature film soundtrackLength37:18LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesProducerMeghdeep BoseAmaal Mallik chronology\n\n\nKabir Singh(2019)\n\nSaina(2021)\n\nKoi Jaane Na(2021)\nOfficial audioSaina - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Amaal Mallik, produced, arranged & co-written by Meghdeep Bose with lyrics by Manoj Muntashir and Kunaal Vermaa.[19]\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsSinger(s)Length1.\"Exordium\"\u2014\u20141:202.\"Chal Wahin Chalein\"Manoj MuntashirShreya Ghoshal5:103.\"The Staircase Of Life\"\u2014Shreya Ghoshal2:314.\"Embrace Yourself\"\u2014Shreya Ghoshal1:385.\"Parinda\"Manoj MuntashirAmaal Mallik5:146.\"One Point For The Sky\"\u2014\u20141:527.\"A Mother's Love\"Manoj MuntashirSuvarna Tiwari1:148.\"Confluence Of Dreams\"\u2014\u20141:229.\"Main Hoon Na Tere Saath\"Kunaal VermaaArmaan Malik5:2710.\"A Rally Of Love & Success\"\u2014\u20141:4611.\"The Curse Of A Champion\"\u2014Snigdha Pious3:0612.\"Hall Of Mirrors\"\u2014Shreya Ghoshal3:3813.\"The Sword Of Saina\"\u2014Suzanne D'Mello3:00Total length:37:18\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Parineeti Chopra-starrer Saina Nehwal biopic to release in March\".
