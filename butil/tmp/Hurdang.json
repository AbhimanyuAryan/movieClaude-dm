They both have on and off relationship with each other. Loha bhaiya is a local goon wants to be taken seriously as a politician and is backed by one of the known politicians in the area.\nDaddu, Jhulan and their friends are studying and planning to give exams to become IAS officers one day. Jhulan knows her potential and works hard towards trying to achieve her dream. Daddu on the other hand wants to leak papers and pass just so he could ask Jhulan's parents if he could marry her. He is seen leaking few papers with help of Loha bhaiya who gets fair share of the amount they collect by selling these papers to students.\nAnd one day there comes a news that V.P Singh government had made up its mind to implement the report put forth by the Mandal Commission, which talked about giving reservations to socially backward classes. There were widespread protests held all over India and in Allahabad, Loha wants to take advantages of this situation. He pushes Daddu to fuel the fire and get students in his campus to protest against the Mandal Commission.\nWhile all this is happening, Jhulan breaks up with him and is planned to get married off to an IAS officer who is naive and believes her stress to be nervousness. On the day riots are at their highest and students get arrested including Daddu, Jhulan is getting married same day and Daddu gets to know about it.\nHe disguises himself as a policeman and flies the station only to know that Jhulan is already married and has given sleeping pills to her husband. They both flee from there and go to Loha's place. Before they leave from there so that no one knows Jhulan is not with her husband Loha insists Daddu to go to riots one last time and lead the crowd.\nLoha has planned to burn Daddu alive which is noticed by his best friend, and he pushes Daddu and gets burned himself. When Daddu finally comprehends that this was Loha's plan all along, he kills Loha and his brother.
