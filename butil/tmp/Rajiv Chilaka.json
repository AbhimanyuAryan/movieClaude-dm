He has an elder brother, Srinivas Chilaka, who helps him in running Greengold.[6][7]\nChilaka is the youngest son of noted technocrat Madhusudan Rao Chilaka and Ms. Chilaka.\nThe magazine Businessworld named Rajiv Chilaka's company Green Gold Animations and Gamitronics as two of the top ten companies in India for making visual content in 2023.[8]\n\nGreen Gold Animation[edit]\nIn January 2001, Chilaka set up Green Gold Animation Pvt Ltd. According to a report in the Indian newspaper, The Hindu it is now \"perhaps the largest animation production company in India that caters primarily to children.\"[6]\nHis first break came in 2004 with the animation series Bongo about an alien who lands on Earth. That led to Vikram Betal, an 80-minute 2D animation on the Cartoon Network in 2005. Chilaka and his team made a series of four animated telefilms on the life of Krishna for the Cartoon Network, before its sister channel Pogo agreed to air their next project Chhota Bheem in 2008. In various interviews Chilaka has shared that were it not for the windfall his company made from Bheem, he and his Greengold would still be in the 'hand to mouth' stage like hundreds perhaps even thousands of other animation companies. According to Chilaka, a few episodes into the telecast of Chhota Bheem, Pogo TV told him that due to the losses suffered the channel can no longer remain in air. But such was the great success in the very next episodes that Pogo continued with content. Chhota Bheem changed everything.[9]\n\nChhota Bheem[edit]\nChilaka has told Wikipedia teams that he devised the concept of an Indian historically mythological hero, Chhota Bheem in 2005. During the first three years of the series Bheem was 'if not out-rightly presented at least allowed to be thought of' as a reincarnation of legendary warrior prince Bhima from Mahabharata but later on the concept itself was modified to make the village of Dholakpur and its inhabitants more contemporary showing episodes featuring things as disparate and modern as Bollywood, trains, air-crafts etc. to emphasise the change. The first episode aired on 6 April 2008. As of 2012, more than 130 episodes have been telecast in English, Hindi, Telugu and Tamil on the Pogo TV.[1] These have been accompanied by more than 10 Chhota Bheem television movies also on Pogo. It has been ranked as the most popular television character among children of 2012 by Ormax Media's Small Wonders.[9]\nIn 2012, the feature film Chhota Bheem and the Curse of Damyaan written by Richa Ingle Deo and Seeta was released. It is considered to be the first Indian home-grown TV series to be made into a feature film.[1] By November 2012, the movie had grossed 50 million Rupees at the box office.[9]\nIn January 2016, the feature film Chhota Bheem Himalayan Adventure written by Teja Pratap and Chilaka was released. The film was directed by Rajiv Chilaka and Rusauro B. Adorable.\nOn 10 May 2019, another feature film titled Chhota Bheem: Kung Fu Dhamaka was released. The film's music was composed by Sunidhi Chauhan and the film was distributed by Yash Raj Films. The film just like the previous ones was directed and produced by Rajiv Chilaka. This was the first film to be released in both 2D and 3D formats.\n\nRelated series[edit]\nThe following series have been created by Green Gold Animations\n\n\n\nOriginal Run\n\nSeries\n\nNetwork\n\nNotes\n\n\n2004\u20132006\nBongo\nDD National\n\n\n\n2006\u20132007\nKrishna\nCartoon Network\n4 part serialised film\n\n\n2008\u2013present\nChhota Bheem\nPogo\n\n\n\n2008\u20132010\nKrishna and Balram\nCartoon Network\n\n\n\n2009\u20132012\nChorr Police\nDisney XD India\n\n\n\n2011\u2013present\nMighty Raju\nPogo\nFirst spin-off of Chhota Bheem series\n\n\n2012\u20132014\nLuv Kushh\nDisney XD\nSeries now in syndication on Discovery Kids India since 2015\n\n\n2014\u20132016\nArjun - Prince of Bali\nDisney Channel India\nSpin off of 2013 film Chhota Bheem and the Throne of BaliSecond spin-off of Chhota Bheem seriesReruns also aired on Disney XD in 2017\n\n\n2017\u2013present\nSuper Bheem\nPogo\nThird spin-off of Chhota Bheem series\n\n\nKalari Kids[10]\nAmazon Prime Video\n\n\n\n2018\u2013present\nKicko & Super Speedo\nSony Yay\n[11]\n\n\nRudra: Boom Chik Chik Boom\nNickelodeon India\n[12]\n\n\n2019\u2013present\nMighty Little Bheem\nNetflix\nFourth spin-off of Chhota Bheem series[13]\n\n\n2021\u2013present\nChhota Bheem: Adventures in Singapore \nVoot Kids\nFifth spin-off of Chhota Bheem series.\n\n\n2022\u2013present\nBheem in the city\nPogo\nSixth spin-off of Chhota Bheem series and the follow-up mini series of the 2020 Chhota Bheem film Bheem in the city\n\nMerchandising and demographics[edit]\nThe merchandising accompanying the popularity of the Chhota Bheem series has produced a range over 500 products such as DVDs, T-shirts, bedsheets, ceiling fans which are available at 20 Green Gold Stores across India as well as on-line games, comics and carnivals.[9]\nChilaka, who directs each episode of the TV series and directed the movie, claims \"the show has worked across demographics\" by not being tied to a specific location in India and \"it's followed equally by boys and girls.\"[1][9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Rao, Subha J.
