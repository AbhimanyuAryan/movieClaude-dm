He added \"it's easy to pick your favourite. Tabu tops the list her pitch is perfect and appears effortless, Kapoor has more to do, and the actor delivers an honest performance while Naseeruddin Shah, Konkana, Radhika, Shardul and Kumud make their limited time on screen count\".[13]\nZinia Bandyopadhyay of India Today rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Kuttey is best enjoyed if you have a knack for dark and wry humour. However, if gore is not your cup of tea, it is best to steer clear from this one. The performances are indeed the strong suit in the film Mishra and Kapoor both will leave you impressed, Tabu, steals the show, Madan is delight to watch, Naseerudin and Konkona\u2019s extended cameo, sets the mood wish they had more screen time\".[14] Avinash Lohana of Pinkvilla rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Kuttey does entertain and enthral, but in parts. The film was capable of a lot more and doesn\u2019t optimise its potential. Kapoor gives a sincere performance, Tabu, Konkona, Kumud delivered controlled performance which leaves an impact, Radhika and Shardul shine in their respective roles\".[15]\nBollywood Hungama rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Kuttey rests on an interesting concept and strong performances but suffers from excessive violence and usage of cuss words\".[16] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Kuttey is a film that certainly does not bark up the wrong tree. On performances she highlighted Tabu's work, who delivers unblemished performance, and admirably supported well by Mishra, Kapoor, Madan and Bharadwaj go along with the flow of the wild tale without missing a beat, while Naseeruddin Shah and Konkona Sen do full justice to their limited roles\".[17] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost rated it 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Kuttey needed some meat to bark. The film doesn\u2019t have a very convincing storyline the unnecessary violence, use of cuss words and a huge waste of some good craftsmen\".[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kuttey\".
