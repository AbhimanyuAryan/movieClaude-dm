Back in New Delhi, he worked briefly with audio-visual filmmaker Sam Mathews.[7][8]\nHe is married to Richa Puranesh, who has an FMCG marketing background, and the couple lived in Delhi for many years. After the success of Khosla Ka Ghosla, they moved to Mumbai and live in Parel, Mumbai with their two daughters.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBanerjee joined advertising as a copywriter first with Shems Combit, TBWA Anthem, and then he joined Contract Advertising, Delhi, where he worked with Pradeep Sarkar, who was then a creative director at the agency. Screenwriter Jaideep Sahni was also one of his colleagues, who later penned Khosla Ka Ghosla's story, screenplay, dialogues and lyrics.[9] In 1997, he left Contract to launch his own company named 'Watermark', with two ex- NID friends, to develop promos for Channel V and MTV and Ad films for major brands.\nWith friend and ex-colleague Jaideep Sahni he conceptualised his debut film \"about Delhi, based in Delhi\", Khosla Ka Ghosla (2006) starring Anupam Kher and Boman Irani, shot in locations in and around New Delhi. The film was a critical and commercial success and won the National Film Award.[3][10] The film brought Banerjee in the list of new filmmakers who were bringing about a marked shift in Bollywood themes, which typically focuses on stories & characters from in and around Mumbai.[11][12]\nBanerjee then co-wrote and directed his second feature, Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! (2008), which was also set in his hometown Delhi. The film starring Abhay Deol, Neetu Chandra and Paresh Rawal, premiered at the International Film Festival of India, Goa, along with Museum of Modern Art, New York.[5][13] It was released in the 2008 Mumbai attacks weekend to positive reviews and went on to become a sleeper hit.[14][15] Rachel Saltz of The New York Times described the film as \"a breezy mix of satire and realism\".[16] Oye Lucky!

The film was shown through Handycams, CCTV cameras and mobile cameras.[18] Dealing with Issues like honour killings, MMS scandals, and sting operations,[19] the film was released on 19 March 2010 to positive reception and strong box office results.[20] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN rated it 4 out of 5, stating \" Dibakar Banerjee's Love, Sex aur Dhoka is the most riveting Hindi film in recent memory. [...] You will be shocked, you will be startled, but walking out of the theatre, you know you have just seen what is possibly the most important Hindi film since Satya and Dil Chahta Hai. Not only does it redefine the concept of \"realistic cinema\", it opens a world of possibilities in terms of how you can shoot films now.\"[21]\nBanerjee's next directorial venture was Shanghai (2012), a political drama involving an assassination of a social activist. Starring Abhay Deol, Kalki Koechlin and Emraan Hashmi, the film was based on the 1967 Greek novel Z written by Vassilis Vassilikos. Shanghai premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and released on 8 June 2012.[22][23]\nIn 2013, Banerjee adapted Satyajit Ray's short story- Patol Babu, Film Star, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui for Bombay Talkies. It was the part of the anthology film made by four directors Including -Anurag Kashyap, Zoya Akhtar and Karan Johar. The film was made as a celebration of 100 years of Indian cinema.[24][25] Bombay Talkies under-performed at the box office,[26] but was well received by critics; specially Banerjee's story. Anupama Chopra in her review mentioned: \"Dibakar narrates his story with such tenderness and Siddiqui is so good that by the end, I was wiping away tears\".[27]\nNext Banerjee went on to adapt Byomkesh Bakshi, created by the Bengali writer Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay, as Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! (2015).[28] The film starring Sushant Singh Rajput as the titular character was produced jointly by Yash Raj Films and his own film production company Dibakar Banerjee Productions.
