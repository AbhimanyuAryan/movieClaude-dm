Due to ongoing killings, the police department assigns Satya's twin brother ACP Jay Balram Azad to investigate the case. Jay begins his investigation, where it is revealed that Jay is also involved with his brother in the killings. Later, Satya and Jay's mother Suhasini Devi Azad wakes up from her coma and reveals that Satya's wife Vidya Maurya's father and the present-CM Chandra Prakash Maurya was behind the death of their father Dadasahab Balram Azad, a patriotic farmer who fought for the rights of the people. After a heavy battle, Satya and Jay manages to kill Chandra Prakash, where they secretly continue their vigilante activities.\n\nCast[edit]\nJohn Abraham in a triple role as\nSocial Activist Dadasaheb Balram Azad, Satya and Jay's father\nHome Minister Satya Balram Azad, Dadasaheb's elder son and Jay's twin brother\nACP Jay Balram Azad IPS, Dadasaheb's younger son and Satya's twin brother\nDev Kharoud in a triple role as\nSocial Activist Sardar Balraj Singh Shergill Sahab, Sukhdev and Baldev 's father\nDistrict Magistrate IAS officer Sukhdev Shergill Balraj 's elder son Baldev twin brother\nDSP Baldev Shergill  IPS, Balraj 's Yonger son and Sukhdev 's twin brother\nJapji Khairaas Shaminder Shergill Balraj 's Wife\nDivya Khosla Kumar as MLA Vidya Maurya Azad, Satya's wife\nHarsh Chhaya as CM Chandra Prakash Maurya, Vidya's father\nAnup Soni as DCP Subodh Upadhyay IPS\nGautami Kapoor as Suhasini Devi Azad\nSahil Vaid as Inspector Gyaneswar Chaurasia\nZakhir Hussain as Minister Shankar Prasad\nRituraj Singh as Madan Lal Joshi\nRajendra Gupta as Daya Kaka\nBhagyashree Limaye as a Doctor\nShaad Randhawa as Sardara\nDaya Shankar Pandey as Parag Tripathi\nSalim Shah as Yashwant Paswan\nDevaksh Rai as Doctor Colleague\nCameo appearance[edit]\nJass Manak as Himself performing his song \"Tenu Lehanga\" at a function\nNora Fatehi in the song \"Kusu Kusu\"[10][11]\nProduction[edit]\nPrincipal photography for Satyameva Jayate 2 commenced on 20 October 2020 in Lucknow, before moving to Mumbai and Raebareli.[12] Filming wrapped up in the last week of January 2021 in Mumbai.[13]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nSatyameva Jayate 2Soundtrack album by Arko, Rochak Kohli, Tanishk Bagchi, Payal Dev and Jass ManakReleased23 November 2021[14]Recorded2020-21GenreFeature film soundtrackLength23:22LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesOfficial audioSatyameva Jayate 2 - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film's music was composed by  Arko, Rochak Kohli, Tanishk Bagchi, Payal Dev and Jass Manak while lyrics written by Manoj Muntashir,  Rashmi Virag, Tanishk Bagchi and Jass Manak.[14]\nThe first song \"Meri Zindagi Hai Tu\" is remake from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's song with same name.

Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, \u2018\u2018Satyameva Jayate 2 is a power packed mass entertainer with entertaining moments and bravura performance by John Abraham\u2019\u2019.[18] Hiren Kotwani of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 3/5 and wrote, \u2018\u2018If you enjoy the massy masala fare of the bygone era and are willing to take on thrice as much of John Abraham in one frame, you can go indulge in this one\u2019\u2019.[19] Murtuza Nullwala of Eastern Eye gave the film a rating of 2/5 and wrote, \u2018\u2018Satyameva Jayate 2 is an outdated film and doesn\u2019t entertain much\u2019\u2019.[20] Anupama Chopra of Film Companion wrote, \u2018\u2018Satyameva Jayate 2 starts with a visual of the Tricolor and then over the next 138 minutes, the film batters us with ear-splitting background music, grotesque visuals, feeble dialogues that are desperate to land punches and superbly hammy acting\u2019\u2019.[21] Sonil Dedhia of News 18 criticized the film by calling its script \u2018\u2018Tacky\u2019\u2019 and  wrote, \u2018\u2018My biggest question is why did the producers decide to put their hard-earned money into this project when Zaveri is known to make the tackiest of films\u2019\u2019.[22] Tatsam Mukherjee of Firstpost gave the film a rating of 0/5 and wrote, \u2018\u2018Satyamev Jayate 2 is an ugly exhibition of appeasement filmmaking, where a director is trying to tick off as many boxes of the audience he can appease, using the most tired tropes in the history of Hindi cinema\u2019\u2019.[23]\nShubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 0.5/5 and wrote, \u2018\u2018Abraham strides through this thing with his standard mix of fixed-frown-and-swinging-fists. Only once or twice does he do the bare-bodied superhero who can take on all comers with a teeny dimpled nudge-wink. The rest is a string of tired stereotypes and bad story-telling, refreshing the dangerous idea of justice being doled out by men arrogating to themselves the power to judge, jury, executioner\u2019\u2019.[24] Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave the film a rating of 1/5 and criticized the soundtrack, dialogues and the characters of the film by writing, \u2018\u2018The soundtrack is shoddy and ear-splitting. The dialogues are clearly the handiwork of a third-rate rhymester. The characters do not speak, they howl\u2019\u2019. He further stated, \u2018\u2018The shoddy cinematic qualities are only one aspect of Satyameva Jayate 2; The film also peddles dangerous ideas about instant justice and patriotism. No Hindi film in living memory has misused the tricolour as brazenly as Satyameva Jayate 2 does; The film invokes the national flag for the purpose of justifying extra-judicial means of punishing the corrupt. In the bargain, all that it does is sully the fair reputation of the world's largest democracy\u2019\u2019.[25] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times called Satyameva Jayate 2 a \u2018\u2018loud, screeching, bloated mess\u2019\u2019 and a \u2018\u2018film no one should have to tolerate\u2019\u2019. She wrote, \u2018\u2018There's not even a single person that's talking in this film. Everyone is shouting, screaming and yelling at the top of their lungs, leaving your eardrums craving for some calm. Satyameva Jayate 2 is a shoddy and sloppy depiction of jingoism and vigilantism at its most shameless\u2019\u2019.[26]\nStutee Ghosh from The Quint gave the film a rating of 1/5 and wrote, \u2018\u2018Satyameva Jayate 2 is all noise and no substance\u2019\u2019. She further stated, \u2018\u2018Satyameva Jayate 2 is mind-bogglingly, excruciatingly loud, on-the-nose, screechy and melodramatic\u2019\u2019.[27] Syed Firdaus Ashraf of Rediff gave the film a rating of 1.5/5 and criticized its script by stating, \u2018\u2018Satyamev Jayate 2 has a dated circa 1990s script which won't find acceptance with today's generations\u2019\u2019. He further wrote, \u2018\u2018The only saving grace in the film is a passable item song Kusu Kusu performed by Nora Fatehi\u2019\u2019.[28] Anuj Kumar from The Hindu wrote, \u2018\u2018Despite being soaked in blood and tears, the cases of injustice have been so mechanically handled that they fail to evoke any empathy for the characters; So much so that even references to the secular fabric of society and women\u2019s safety sound gratuitous\u2019\u2019.[29] Nandini Ramnath from  Scroll wrote, \u2018\u2018The director Zaveri throws everything in his powers at his barren canvas. The dialogue is screamed rather than spoken and competes with the blaring background music. By shooting the same scene from ten angles and deploying rapid zooms and editing gimmicks, Zaveri hopes that the rampant tackiness will not be apparent\u2019\u2019.[30]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Vibha Maru (22 October 2021). \"John Abraham's Satyameva Jayate 2 to release on Nov 25, a day before its scheduled date\".
