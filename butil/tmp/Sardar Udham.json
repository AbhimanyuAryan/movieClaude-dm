The screenplay is written by Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Ritesh Shah, with Bhattacharya also writing the story based on team research, and Shah also writing the dialogues, while playing a supporting role. Based on the life of Udham Singh, a freedom fighter from Punjab who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar,[1] the film starred Vicky Kaushal in the title role, along with Shaun Scott, Stephen Hogan, Amol Parashar, Banita Sandhu and Kirsty Averton in supporting roles.\nThe film was officially announced in March 2019, with principal photography began on April. In a marathon schedule of 7 months, the makers completed the shooting of the film in December 2019. Set in India and England, principal photography took place in Russia and India, with few sequences in United Kingdom and Ireland.[2] Sardar Udham features musical score composed by Shantanu Moitra, cinematography handled by Avik Mukhopadhyay and editing done by Chandrashekhar Prajapati.\nInitially being delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the makers headed for a direct-to-digital premiere through the streaming service Amazon Prime Video. The film released on 16 October 2021, during the Dusshera weekend and eventually received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed on Kaushal's performance, direction, screenplay and technical aspects. The film was also noted for its realistic portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, being depicted in an extended and graphic sequence. Sardar Udham was listed by several publications as one of the best Hindi films of 2021, and subsequently won five National Film Awards including Best Feature Film In Hindi, as well as nine Filmfare Awards.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film follows a non-linear narrative, going back and forth from the present, where Sardar Udham Singh is in London, to his past when he was part of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and explores his reasons for assassinating Indian Civil Service officer Michael O'Dwyer. Udham (known as Sher Singh) is released from prison at Punjab in British India. He is constantly being watched by the colonial authorities. He leaves India and goes to the USSR during what appears to be winter. From there, he makes his way to London by ship. Even though the British authorities are on the lookout for him, he successfully evades them and lives in London, making a living as a salesman and then a welder. He is shown in front of Caxton Hall, making his way inside where O'Dwyer is giving a speech on his time as Lt. Governor of Punjab and how he had suppressed a major uprising. Udham makes his way to O'Dwyer and shoots him, and is arrested.\nUdham is appointed a lawyer who slowly gets Udham to tell his backstory. Udham is brought to court and in spite of a good lawyer, the judges sentence him to death. Upon hearing this, Udham makes an impromptu speech where he denounces British rule in India and reaffirms his support for the Indian freedom movement. Udham protests the conditions of his detention and goes on a 42-day fast, but is force-fed to break it. He slowly opens up to the investigating inspector and tells him the reasons for the assassination. Udham also got the title of Shaheed-E-Azam.\nIn 1919, Udham is a young adult working in a textile mill near Amritsar, with a girlfriend who is mute. On 13 April 1919, in favour of O'Dwyer, General Dyer opens fire on a crowd of 20,000 peaceful protestors inside Jallianwala Bagh. Udham is sleeping unaware of the massacre, until his friend wakes him up, mortally wounded and bleeding profusely. He hears about the massacre and rushes to the grounds to help. It is shown that along with a few other volunteers, Udham finds survivors and gets them to a makeshift hospital which is overwhelmed itself. He is later executed and shown to have a photo of Bhagat Singh, taken when Bhagat was in prison during his final days.\nAfter the independence of India, Udham's ashes are brought to the country upon the request of Punjab Chief Minister Giani Zail Singh, and were immersed in the Sutlej river. His ashes were immersed in the same place as his idol, Bhagat. In the final scene, Dyer and O'Dwyer give their own accounts to the Hunter Commission.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nVicky Kaushal as Sher \"Udham\" Singh aka Ram Mohammad Singh Azad\nShaun Scott as Michael O'Dwyer\nStephen Hogan as Detective Inspector Swain\nAmol Parashar as Bhagat Singh\nBanita Sandhu as Reshma\nKirsty Averton as Eileen Palmer\nAndrew Havill as General Reginald Dyer\nRitesh Shah as Koppikar\nManas Tiwari as Nihal Singh\nTim Berrington as John Hutchinson\nTim Hudson as Winston Churchill\nNicholas Gecks as Justice Atkinson\nSam Retford as Detective Deighton\nSimon Weir as King George VI\nJogi Mallang as Surat Ali\nKuljeet Singh as S.

Plus, it's also a big honour for me that finally, I am going to be directed by him. Honestly, that's something that will take time to sink in\".[5] The film marked the second Indian project to be based on the life of the Indian revolutionary after the Raj Babbar-starrer Shaheed Udham Singh (2000).[6]\n\nShoojit Sircar initially wanted Irrfan Khan to play the lead, but due to health issues,[7] he stepped out working on the film and had insisted to cast Vicky Kaushal in the lead.[8]\nThe film's storyline traces from Singh's age of 20 to 40, showcasing the events of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, to the assassination of Michael O'Dwyer, the Governor of Punjab who was responsible for the incident.[4] The idea was initially pitched to be presented in mid-1990s, after Sircar read about the events and life of Udham Singh, when he was a student at the Shaheed Bhagat Singh College in Delhi, but had waited for two decades due to his extensive research about Udham Singh, with Sircar wanting to showcase Udham's life to the current generation of younger audiences.[9][10] Initially, the role was offered to Irrfan Khan,[11] and his son Babil Khan was reported to play the younger version of Udham Singh.[12] However, due to the former's health issues, he stepped out doing the role and insisted Kaushal to play the lead.[13][11] Kaushal had undergone physical transformation to represent the younger version of Singh, losing 15 kilograms within two months.[14] \nIn November 2019, Banita Sandhu who worked with Sircar in October (2018), confirmed her presence, saying that she would play an important role in the film.[15] Television and theatre actor Amol Parashar was assigned to play the role of Indian freedom fighter Bhagat Singh.[16][17] Parashar told in an interview with The Indian Express, saying \"I didn\u2019t have to copy any other actor\u2019s interpretation because nobody knows how tall he was, how he walked. It\u2019s only through the written accounts, which mostly are about his ideas and thought process. Now we needed to create a person who\u2019s believable. It was more about his energy.\"[16] The film also has British actors Shaun Scott, Kirsty Averton and Stephen Hogan playing prominent roles.[18] Originally titled Sardar Udham Singh, the title was later changed to Sardar Udham.[19]\n\nFilming[edit]\nOn the centennial year of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, on 13 April 2019, principal photography began in London (with a 25\u2013day schedule being filmed); the team then moved to Russia in late-April, filming several sequences in Saint Petersburg.[4][20] Since the film is set in the pre-independence era, Sircar wanted to recreate the settings, characters and other things related to that period.[1] Being his first period film, he noted the difficultly he had doing in research, saying \"there are few records available and those there are were speculative\".[4] He gained ideas on recreating that period by watching American and European cinema, documentaries, and pictures from online archives.[10] Four days before filming started, Kaushal faced injuries while shooting for another film and had 13 stitches on his cheek. But Sircar advised him to come with the shoot saying that Sardar Udham will also have stitches, and shot for his portions with a real scar in his face.[21]\nThe filmmakers shot a month-long schedule in Russia and the team headed to Ireland and Germany during mid-June 2019.[22][failed verification] With a three-month shooting in parts of Europe and other countries, the team returned to India to commence a schedule in Amritsar, Punjab in October 2019.[23] The schedule went on for 25 days, where sequences featuring the massacre and its aftermath being shot.[24] Vicky Kaushal stated in an interview on the recreation of the incident that \"it was physically exhausting, heart-wrenching and emotionally numbing as an individual, but as an actor, we have to be prepared at all sorts. To be thrown into that reality, almost a reality, to imagine yourself in that space. I had to react to dead bodies and all that bloodshed and bloodbath.\"[25][26] Since the crew were not allowed to shoot the incidents at Jallianwala Bagh, the makers recreated few portions in empty sets in Punjab. Some scenes were also shot at Hoshiarpur.[10] The team later returned to Europe to shoot a few sequences in November.[27] Filming wrapped up on 27 December 2019, after consecutively filming for 6\u20137 months.[28] The portions set in London were recreated in Russia, excepts for a few sequences which were shot in United Kingdom and Ireland.[10][29]\n\nPost-production[edit]\nThe film's post-production was scheduled to begin during mid-March 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 lockdown in India.[30] On 8 June 2020, the makers decided to begin post-production activities for the film, with Sircar activating a four-phase plan, starting with the editing process, which would go on for 15\u201320 days.[31][32] Chandrashkehar Prajapati was the editor of the film, and during the editing process, only the director, editor, and his assistants were allowed inside the editing room, working while strictly adhering to social distancing protocols, and had to complete all editing works before the night curfew at 7:00\u00a0p.m.[33] He also felt grateful that the film industry has developed an app that allowed them to share edited content, frame by frame, with explanatory comments, back and forth through the internet.[34] Sircar wanted to resume visual effects in the second phase of post-production, but this was pushed back, as this required a larger crew of about 150\u2013200 people.[35][36]\nComposer Shantanu Moitra worked on the film's score during June 2020.[32] During mid-September 2020, the filmmakers resumed work on visual effects.[37] Work on the sound design resumed in October, as the last phase in the post-production process. A part of the sound design was done in Europe, and another part took place in-house in Kolkata.[35] Other activities such as digital intermediate, color grading and pre-visualization eventually began during early-2021.[32] As per the suggestion of cinematographer Avik Mukhopadhyay and other crew members \u2014 executive producer Kumar Thakur, art directors Mansi Mehta and Dmitriy Malich \u2014 the filmmakers focused on the use of colour palettes with a gray-colored theme during the foreign sequences, and a sepia-colored theme for the sequences in Amritsar.[10] Vicky Kaushal completed dubbing for his portions in September 2021.[38]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Sardar Udham (score)\nSardar Udham is a song-less film; its soundtrack featured six instrumental compositions used in the film score curated and composed by Shantanu Moitra,[35] which was recorded during the COVID-19 lockdown period in June 2020, and were produced by George Joseph.[32][39] The soundtrack was released by Zee Music Company on 2 October 2021.[40]\n\nRelease[edit]\nIn June 2019, Shoojit Sircar announced that the film would be released theatrically on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti (2 October 2020),[41] while also rumoured to be clashing with Satyameva Jayate 2 and Jayeshbhai Jordaar.[42][43] However, the film was later rescheduled for release on 30 December 2020,[44][45] which was also postponed, since post-production was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[46] Despite the delays, Sircar decided to release the film in theatres, unlike other major Hindi films, which debuted on digital streaming platforms ever since the closure of theatres across the country due to the pandemic.[47]\nIn September 2021, the producers headed for a direct-to-digital release, considering that theatres were reopened but only in limited states,[48] and also the government did not allow permission to resume operations of theatres in Maharashtra until 22 October 2021.[49] The producers later sold the distribution rights of the film to Amazon Prime Video,[50] which scheduled for a release date of 16 October 2021, coinciding with Dusshera weekend.[51] On 27 September 2021, the filmmakers released the teaser of the film, which introduced its theme and premise in a unique way.[52][53] Three days later, on 30 September, the official trailer of the film was launched at an event in Mumbai, with the presence of Vicky Kaushal and Shoojit Sircar, along with the film's crew.[54][55] The trailer received positive response from fans.[56][57]\nKaushal shared his working stills of the film prior to the release, and also shared facts about Udham Singh, in his Instagram account.[14][58] On 15 October 2021, a day prior to the release, a special screening of Sardar Udham was conducted to the press, critics and celebrities at a theatre in Mumbai.[59][60] On the night of the same day, Amazon Prime Video released the film earlier ahead of the scheduled release of 16 October, in more than 240 countries and also in Hindi, Punjabi and English languages.[61]\n\nReception[edit]\nVicky Kaushal received high critical acclaim for his portrayal of Udham Singh\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, praising the performances of Kaushal and the supporting cast, realistic portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the setting of pre-independent India, technical aspects, script and direction. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 18 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10.[62]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave a positive review stating it as \"a long, unhurried re-creation of a turbulent slice of India\u2019s colonial past, going back and forth from Punjab to London, with a few detours here and there\".[63] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost also gave a positive review stating \"Shoojit Sircar has chosen to recount a remarkable (and painful) true story with a reliance on facts and facts alone\", and further stated \"The atrocities committed by the British colonisers in India are epitomised by the cruelty of Jallianwala Bagh. It is nothing short of a feat that Sircar has managed to chronicle that tragedy and its aftermath without turning his film into a call for vendetta. Both in terms of artistic merit and the political statements it makes, Sardar Udham is a landmark for Indian cinema.\"[64]\nNamrata Joshi of National Herald India wrote \"Shoojit Sircar\u2019s biopic of the patriot is a stunning slice of history mirroring our fractious present and cautioning us about the pitfalls of the future\".[65] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV stated \"The brilliantly lensed biopic also draws power from lead actor Vicky Kaushal's intense and intuitive performance. Sircar combines a portrait of shocking brutality with a depiction of one man's determination not to back off from his risky stratagem. There is a phenomenal degree of craft in Sardar Udham but none of it is employed for mere effect. There is great deal of soul, too, in this magnificently crafted film.\"[66] Renuka Vyahare of The Times of India stated \"This film is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode but beware; the wait tries your patience. The intention is to give a lull before the storm treatment to storytelling. The non-linear, non-verbose narrative struggles to hold your attention even an hour into the movie. The re-enactment of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is unsettling to watch and that is the very reason why this story needed to be told.\"[67] Writing for The Week magazine, Aishwarya Venugopal stated \"For the biopic of a revolutionary, the film does not throw punch dialogoues or the over-used trope of jingoism. Instead, Sircar takes the viewer smoothly, yet painfully, through his turbulent life\".[68] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu stated \"Shoojit Sircar explores contentious definitions and concerns, as India continues to grapple with the idea of dissent, and Section 144 remains a repressive tool in the hands of the government of the day\".[69]\nSoumya Srivatsava of Hindustan Times wrote \"Sardar Udham, if there was ever any doubt, also proves once again that Shoojit Sircar is in top form and among the most dependable filmmakers in Hindi cinema right now. From slices of lives to biographies on historical heroes, he has been able to give his distinct stamp to any idea he has picked up. Hope the streak continues another 20 years.\"[70] Nandini Ramanath of Scroll.in stated \"Sardar Udham follows a handful of biopics about a historical figure whose colourful life readily lends itself to fictionalisation. The creators, bravely but also puzzlingly resist the temptation to include what might have been a shoo-in. The non-linear screenplay by Shubendu Bhattacharya (who also has a story credit) and Ritesh Shah is based on facts but takes creative licence with them.\"[71] On the other hand, Syed Firdaus Ashraf of Rediff gave a mixed review saying \"You neither get goosebumps nor the adrenaline rush of desh bhakti (patriotism), which a film like Sardar Udham should give every Indian. But a story of an unsung hero is needed to be told and hats off to Shoojit Sircar for doing that.\"[72]\nSeveral publications listed Sardar Udham as one of the best Bollywood films of 2021, which includes: The Indian Express (Shubhra Gupta and Minnasa Shekhar),[73][74] Film Companion (Anupama Chopra),[75] Hindustan Times (Devarsi Ghosh),[76] The Hindu (Anuj Kumar),[77] India Today (Anandita Mukherjee)[78] and Firstpost (Subhash K.

The notice had stated \"We, Surjit Movies and Iqbal Singh Dhillon are the producers and the sole, exclusive and absolute owners of copyrights and all other rights and to all the works of the Punjabi and Hindustani film Shaheed Udham Singh: Alias Ram Mohammed Singh Azad.\"[85] In defence, few sources had stated that team did not borrow anything from that film and further added that by 2000, all his life's work is copyright free and the team will not have any trouble for the film, unless the family of Udham Singh have any issue with the content.[85]\n\nAcademy Award submission[edit]\nThe film was shortlisted among 14 other Indian films to be submitted at the 94th Academy Awards under the nomination of Best International Film category.[86][87] However, it was not selected. The jury members \u2014 Bengali music composer-director Indraadip Dasgupta and production designer Sumit Basu \u2014 criticised the length of the film and its delayed climax, which was the reason for not being selected to the nominations.[88] The latter, however, stated that the film projects \"hatred towards the British\".[89][90] The decision from the jury members received some backlash, calling their reasons \"baseless\".[91] However, the director Shoojit Sircar and Vicky Kaushal respected the jury's decision as \"a personal and subjective opinion\".[91][92] They however supported the Tamil film Koozhangal, which was selected as the official entry to the award ceremony, but that was also not nominated.[93][94][95]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Vicky Kaushal kicks off Sardar Udham Singh, details of his character and shoot schedule revealed\".
