It stars Shahid Kapoor as a former cricketer who returns to the game for his son's wish of buying a Jersey T- Shirt, alongside Mrunal Thakur and Pankaj Kapoor.[7][8] The film is produced by Geetha Arts, Dil Raju Production, Sithara Entertainments and Brat Films.[9]\nOfficial announcement for the film was made in October 2019.[10] Principal photography commenced in Chandigarh in December 2019 and ended in December 2020, amidst delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jersey was originally scheduled for a cinema release on 28 August 2020 but was postponed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was theatrically released on 22 April 2022. Despite a positive reception from the critics and praise for Shahid Kapoor's performance, Jersey performed poorly at the box office.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\n26-year-old Arjun Talwar is an extraordinary cricketer from Chandigarh with the highest batting average in all of India and 106 half-centuries, fifty-two centuries, nine double centuries and two triple centuries to his name. Following the 1985-86 Duleep Trophy finals, Arjun awaits news of his selection in the India national team, only to find out his inclusion in the list was a misprint. Following this, he quits cricket. Arjun then applies for a job in the food sector and shortly after marries his girlfriend Vidya, with whom he has a son named Ketan, nicknamed Kittu. However, sometime in the early 1990s, Arjun is suspended from his job on corruption charges, although he is innocent.\nIn 1996, Arjun lives with Vidya and Kittu in a dilapidated house in Chandigarh, with Vidya struggling to make ends meet as a hotel receptionist. Kittu loves playing cricket, much like Arjun did, and wishes to get a jersey of the Indian national team for his upcoming birthday. Arjun tries getting one, but finds out it is very expensive; he then tries to loan the Jersey in vain and Vidya refuses to lend him money for the same. His friends try pooling funds for the jersey, but fall very short of the budget. Arjun's former coach Baali Sir approaches him to inform him of an upcoming charity match between Punjab and New Zealand, with players' fees included. Arjun's friend lies that Arjun has agreed to play, forcing Arjun to practice for the match late at night.\nThe next day, the New Zealand team bats impressively and sets a high target for Punjab. At first, Punjab seems to be losing the match, with very few runs and wickets falling quick. Arjun is sent onto the pitch, hitting fours and sixes with ease. Although the Punjab team eventually loses the match by one run, Arjun is praised by many, especially Kittu, for his exceptional batting. However, he is dismayed to find out that players' fees are going to charity as well. Arjun, ashamed that he was unable to get his son a jersey, tells Baali Sir that he wants to get back up playing cricket.\nOfficials are skeptical about Arjun, a 36-year-old, playing cricket, thinking he will not do well and will quit again in a year or two. However, they then see him play during practice, amazed by how he is able to score easily. Selections for the upcoming Ranji Trophy are underway, with only 15 out of 30 of the trainees being selected. The results come in, and Arjun is ecstatic after finding out that his name in the list. The first few matches go well, with Arjun making centuries effortlessly and simultaneously earning his teammates' respect and teaching them some of his techniques. Meanwhile, Arjun's time on the field takes a toll on him, resulting in him having to go to the hospital for some tests. Although it is said he may not be able to play in the finals, Arjun nevertheless appears for the match against Karnataka at the Wankhede Stadium.\nIn the second half of the match, he is pitted against Gowda, a bowler from the Karnataka team who has effortlessly taken wickets of batsmen who had played prior in the match. Gowda proves to be a challenge to Arjun, who however manages to get to a century. Gowda tries many tricks to take Arjun's wicket. However, this does not deter Arjun from scoring. In the final over, the team barely manages to score runs due to the opposition's strong bowling and Arjun being on the non-striker end. On the final ball, Arjun needing three runs to win, attempts to hit a sixer. Despite risking being run out, Arjun manages to make the required runs for his team to win the match and the trophy.\nIn 2022, Jasleen Shergill, a journalist who supported Arjun during his comeback, writes a biography about him titled Jersey. At a function relating to the book, it is revealed that recently, a list of players selected for the Indian national team headed to England was found, with Arjun's name included in it. A grown-up Ketan is then called upon stage to receive a jersey with Arjun's name on it, thus fulfilling his childhood dream of getting a jersey. Ketan reveals that shortly after the Ranji finals, Arjun had to be admitted to the hospital, succumbing to heart failure caused by arrythmia, something Arjun chose to keep a secret and the reason why he quit cricket. Ketan then ends his speech by stating that while people believed his father lost his life while trying, it was the opposite; even during hardships, Arjun never backed down till the very end.\n\nCast[edit]\nShahid Kapoor as Arjun Talwar, Vidya's husband and Kittu's father\nMrunal Thakur as Vidya Rao Talwar, Arjun's wife and Kittu's mother\nPankaj Kapur as Baali, Arjun's coach\nSaurabh V Pandey as Ravindra Singh, Punjab cricket team\u2019s captain <[11]\nPrit Kamani as Ketan Talwar (Kittu), Arjun's son (cameo)\nRonit Kamra as Young Ketan Talwar aka Kittu\nGeetika Mehandru as Jasleen Shergill[12]\nRudrashish Majumdar as Rudra Juneja\nAnjum Batra as Amrit, Arjun's friend\nRituraj Singh as Mahesh Karmarkar, Mumbai Coach\nVinay Varma as Krishna Rao, Vidya's father\nProduction[edit]\nMain Field of The Doon School where some cricket scenes were filmedDoon's cricket pavilion where a song and a few scenes were shot.\nSpeculations for a remake of the Telugu film Jersey (2019) began soon after its release.
