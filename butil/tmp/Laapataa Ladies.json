She does away with marquee names in Laapataa Ladies... and employs three first-timers in a lively tale of two brides caught in a terrible mix-up.\"[15]\nBollywood Hungama rated the film 3/5 stars, writing, \"Laapataa Ladies works due to the amusing plot, performances, underlying message and some memorable funny and emotional scenes.\"[16]\nCatherine Bray of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated, \"If you can get with the larky premise, Kiran Rao\u2019s tale of mixed-up newlyweds makes for a gently probing comedy of manners.\"[17]\nIn a review for The Indian Express, Shubhra Gupta rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Kiran Rao's film is unapologetically message-y, but its strongly beating feminist heart overrides the broad brush strokes. Sometimes things need to be stated loud and clear.\"[18]\nRishil Jogani of Pinkvilla rated the film 4/5 and opined that Laapataa Ladies \"is funny, witty, quirky, entertaining and empowering. It is an extremely important film that utilises the power of cinema in the right way\".[19]\nTushar Joshi of India Today said in his review that \"\u2018Laapataa Ladies\u2019 is a terrific watch simply because it is put together so well. The length might be a slight issue, but if you invest your heart into this tale of two women gone missing, then you will be in for a treat.\"[20]\nRajiv Vijayakar from Koimoi gave the film a solid 4.5 stars out of 5, claiming, \"A seemingly rural slice-of-life dramedy suddenly spirals into a powerful social statement!\" He further wrote \"The film is thus not just value-for-money entertainment but a movie you will carry home with its progressive angles, not just for women but also for society.\"[21]\n\nBox office[edit]\nOn its first day, the film earned Nett of \u20b975 lakh, followed by \u20b91.45 crore on the second day and \u20b91.7 crore on the third day, a first weekend total of \u20b93.75 crore.
