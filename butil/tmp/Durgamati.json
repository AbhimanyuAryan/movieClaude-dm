Ashok which is a remake of his own Telugu\u2013Tamil bilingual film  Bhaagamathie (2018).[3] It stars Bhumi Pednekar as an IAS officer, with Arshad Warsi, Jisshu Sengupta and Mahie Gill playing supporting roles. The film is produced by Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar and Vikram Malhotra under T-Series, Cape of Good Films and Abundantia Entertainment.[4]\nThe official announcement for the film was made on 30 November 2019.[5] First shot was taken on 23 January 2020 in Madhya Pradesh and filming begun there on 30 January.[6] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film has been available to stream worldwide from 11 December 2020 on Amazon Prime Video.[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nThe film starts with Ishwar Prasad, a politician who vows to resign from his post if the government fails to recover idols stolen over six months. This troubles his political rivals, who forge a plan to destroy his credibility with CBI Joint Director Satakshi Ganguly and Assistant Commissioner of Police Abhay Singh.\nThe two plan to interrogate IAS Chanchal Chauhan, a close confidante of Ishwar, who is in jail for murdering her fianc\u00e9 Shakti, Abhay's brother. To avoid attention, they shift her to Durgamati Bungalow, a dilapidated, supposedly haunted house in the outskirts of a city, for the interrogation. The CBI question Chanchal to get some clues against Ishwar, but she repeats that he is a good man and doubts his integrity without proof in a cryptic but leading manner.\nLater that night, the spirit of Durgamati, the Queen of the house before independence, takes control of Chanchal. The CBI team calls upon a psychiatrist to investigate the matter, who concludes that Chanchal must be schizophrenic as she seems to take on a different persona and narrate some story from a book as if it were her own. He suggests that the CBI commit her to an asylum. However, Abhay suspects that this might be a ploy by her to escape and arranges for a spiritual guru to find out if there is paranormal activity. The guru suggests a few indicators. Later, Abhay discovers that those indicators indicate the presence of ghosts in the bungalow. He also finds Chanchal hurting herself under the influence of the spirit. This leads to Abhay taking Chanchal to a mental hospital.\nIshwar visits her at the mental asylum, and it is revealed that Chanchal had planned the entire thing to escape the CBI in return for a 300 Crore kickback from Ishwar. It is also shown that Ishwar had forced Chanchal to kill Shakti (her fianc\u00e9) to hide his scam regarding a welfare project.\nMeanwhile, Satakshi realizes that Chanchal was trying to convey the truth of Ishwar's crimes using the story of Queen Durgamati, which she came across from the various writings and artifacts she had discovered in the bungalow. She also finds evidence of Ishwar's misdeeds and the site where he hid the villagers after killing Shakti with a gun.\nThus vindicated, Chanchal is seen running a charity organization in memory of Shakti. Satakshi then tells her that they thought they knew everything about her but never knew that she was a great magician in her childhood and learned Arabic. Chanchal replies by saying that she does not know Arabic, which shocks them, hinting that there was actual paranormal activity in the house.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBhumi Pednekar as Chanchal Chauhan IAS / Durgamati\nArshad Warsi as Central Minister Ishwar Prasad[7]\nJisshu Sengupta as ACP Abhay Singh (Shakti's Elder Brother)[8]\n\nMahie Gill as CBI Chief Satakshi Ganguly[9]\nKaran Kapadia as Shakti Singh[7]\nPrabhat Raghunandan as Ajay Yadav\nAshok Sharma as Ajay's father\nDhanraj as Nand Singh\nBrij Bhushan Shukla as Gopi\nAda Singh as Satakshi's daughter\nShoeb Ali as Sodhi\nShubhendra Gupta as Analyser\nChandan Vicky Roy as Darruk\nAmit Behl as Jose\nK.

He Concluded that 'All in all, Durgamati turns out to be one of those rare films (especially in the current times) that you can watch comfortably with your family. Play it on and you won't be disappointed. Pallabi Dey Purkayastha of Times of India gave the film 2.5/5 stars by saying that 'Durgamati is relevant but the storytelling lacks the spirit it needed'. She praised Sengupta's performance by saying that he charms us the way he always does, effortlessly. She concluded that Durgamati could be delivered better.[13]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\nDurgamatiSoundtrack album by Tanishk Bagchi, Naman Adhikari, Abhinav Sharma and Malini AwasthiReleased11\u00a0December\u00a02020\u00a0(2020-12-11)[14]GenreFeature film soundtrackLength8:09LanguageHindiLabelT-SeriesOfficial audioDurgamati - Full Album on YouTube\n\nThe film score was composed by Jakes Bejoy and the songs were composed by Tanishk Bagchi, Naman Adhikari, Abhinav Sharma and Malini Awasthi while lyrics written by Tanishk Bagchi and Dipti Misra.\n\nTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsMusicSinger(s)Length1.\"Baras Baras\"Tanishk BagchiTanishk BagchiB Praak, Altamash Faridi3:202.\"Heer\"Dipti MisraNaman Adhikari, Abhinav Sharma, Malini AwasthiMalini Awasthi4:49Total length:8:09\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Coolie No.1, Chhalaang, Durgavati and others to premiere on Amazon Prime Video\".
