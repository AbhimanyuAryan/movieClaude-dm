Balamani is determined to turn Liger into a MMA champion and takes him to a coach named Christopher, who trains him. While Liger is on his way to perfection in the sport, he meets a rich young woman, Tanya, and falls in love with her. After learning from her brother Sanju that Liger has a stammering problem, Tanya, apparently embarrassed, leaves him. Liger wins the national championship after getting motivated by the rejection. He moves on to participate in the International Championship, sponsored by Sanju and Tanya's father.\nLiger wins every match and moves on to the finals. However, Tanya is kidnapped days before the finals. Upon getting to know of this, Liger confronts Tanya's father. He reveals that he borrowed money from a gangster to set up his business, and remains helpless, as he could not repay the money back to him. After her father reveals that Tanya broke up with Liger so he could focus on his sport and career after his mother chastised her for being a distraction, Liger decides to save Tanya by himself, which ultimately causes him to miss the final match. He stumbles upon the kidnapper, who happens to be Mark Anderson, his lifelong role model and legendary MMA fighter.\nAnderson challenges him to a fight to get Tanya back. The fight is live streamed at the MMA final. When Liger is on the verge of losing, he remembers the advice that his mother gave him and defeats Anderson. Impressed by his skills, Anderson takes a picture with Liger and Tanya, and lets them go. As a result of the successful fight, the MMA jury declares the fight between Anderson and Liger as the final match.

In other words, Liger is a wasted opportunity\".[36] Arvind V of Pinkvilla rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"The performances are mixed at best. Vijay Deverakonda is measured and earnest\".[37] Sonil Dedhia of News 18 rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Liger seems so long that by the end, I started feeling why did I get into this Aafat\". She also called Deverakonda's performance as repetitive and tiresome.[38] Sudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and called it 'a crossbreed between cringe and clich\u00e9'. He added, \"The kicks and punches in Puri Jagannadh's weakly written Liger seem directed at us\".[39] A reviewer for Bollywood Hungama rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"On the whole, Liger fails to impress due to its silly and bizarre narrative and poor writing. At the box office, it will have a tough time attracting the audience to cinemas\".[40]\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 1 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"There's nothing new or fresh about the ingredients that go into the making of this Liger. The plot is filled with all kinds of outlandish situations, and the treatment is jaded\".[41] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 1 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Liger is massive mess of a movie that Vijay Deverakonda's newfangled physique and action chops cannot salvage\".[42] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com rated the film 1 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Director Puri Jagannadh's off-putting humour and ridiculous ambitions ensure Liger is a dead duck from the word go\".[43] Suresh Bishnoi of cinereveal.com rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"The film presents a fine example of action choreography, but casting, acting and direction is so sick\".[44] Stutee Ghosh of The Quint rated the film 1 out of 5 stars and called the film 'a disappointment of colossal portions'.[45] Sanyukta Thakare of Mashable India rated the film 0.5 out of 5 stars and said, \"0.5 is for the longest fight montage I have even seen, also only good part of the movie.\"[46] Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost rated the film 0 .1 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Liger overflows with the signature tackiness of Puri Jagannadh's films and the misogyny that Vijay Deverakonda has proudly worn on his sleeve since he struck box-office gold with Arjun Reddy\".[47]\nSanjukta Sharma of Moneycontrol noted in her review, \"Devarakonda has the swagger of a testosterone bomb but has no consistence in his impersonation of either the lover or the fighter. Liger is an example of how cringe-worthy big Bollywood can get to resuscitate ticket sales. This attempt is out-and-out a lost case of such desperation.\"[48] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times wrote in her review, \"Puri Jagannadh's Liger is extremely flawed and below average for the hype it created\". She added that the film is devoid of any coherent plot, performances, or action that does not involve the hero strutting in slow-motion.[49] Shomini Sen of WION in her review noted, \"Lots of mindless action sequences, arbitrary songs and a story that lacks logic- 'Liger' feels like an ordeal to sit through\".[50] Aditi Chavan of First India wrote in her review, \"Overall, Liger is a meme-worthy asinine film that does not do justice as Vijay's Hindi debut.\"[51]\n\nBox office[edit]\nLiger grossed \u20b923.12 crore worldwide on its opening day including \u20b915.3 crore from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, with a distributor share of \u20b913.45 crore including \u20b92.56 crore from overseas market.[52] On second day it collected \u20b97.7 crore worldwide, on third and fourth day it collected \u20b96.55 crore and \u20b95.24 crore respectively. So on the weekend it collected India net \u20b935.44 crore and \u20b948.5 crore worldwide gross.and on fifth day it collected \u20b91.5 crore.\nLiger performed poorly at the box office. Latha Srinivasan of Firstpost attributed the film's failure to over-hyped promotions and audience expectations.[53] Writing for Hindustan Times, Abhimanyu Mathur stated that the film's team tried to manufacture a pan-Indian success by casting actors from Hindi film industry and failed.[54]\nIn October 2022, News18 Telugu reported that the film has collected a total worldwide gross of \u20b960.80 crore with a distributors' share of \u20b928.20 crore. Thus, the film incurred a total loss of \u20b961.80 crore.[55]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Liger\". British Board of Film Classification.
