(October 2023)\nA critic of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and noted, \"Donois a clean family entertainer and works due to its simplicity, relatable goings-on and some funny and emotional moments. At the box office, it\u2019ll need a strong word of mouth to attract its target audience.\"[11] Ganesh Aaglave of Firstpost gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and noted, \"Dono is a modern-day love story, which works well because of its fresh writing. The story will find relevance among the youth but the stretched runtime of over two-and-a-half hours plays a bit spoiler. The film is visually appealing.\"[12]\nSonil Dedhia of News18 India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and noted, \"With Dono, Avnish gives Bollywood romance a simple yet interesting love story. The film is much too long, though. There is a noticeable dip just before the interval and things tend to get convenient. The film delivers decent entertainment and leaves you with a smile at the end of it.\"[13] Deepa Gahlot of Rediff.com gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and noted, \"With Dono, Avnish has slowly dragged the story a few miles over the boundary into the territory of contemporary lifestyle. There are no great emotional highs or lows in the film. It is just made up of little moments of normal interactions between young people.\"[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Dono Box Office\".
