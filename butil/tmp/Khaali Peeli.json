On 13 September, the producers changed the spelling of the title, from \"Beyonc\u00e9\" to \"Beyonse\".[15] News18 India reported that Jay-Z trademarked and protected the name \"Beyonc\u00e9\" and it therefore cannot be used without their permission.[16] The title was subsequently changed again, to \"Duniya Sharma Jayegi\".[17] However, despite the name change, the video received 1 million dislikes within its first week on YouTube.[18]\n\nAll music is composed by Vishal\u2013ShekharTrack listingNo.TitleLyricsSinger(s)Length1.\"Duniya Sharma Jaayegi\" (previously \"Beyonce Sharma Jaayegi\" and \"Beyonse Sharma Jaayegi\")Kumaar, Raj ShekharNakash Aziz, Neeti Mohan3:322.\"Tehas Nehas\"KumaarShekhar Ravjiani, Prakriti Kakar3:553.\"Shana Dil\"Raj ShekharDivya Kumar2:58Total length:10:25\nRelease[edit]\nKhaali Peeli was originally scheduled to be released worldwide on 11 June 2020 in cinemas, before the COVID-19 pandemic led to its postponement owing to cinemas shutdown.[19] In August 2020, the makers sold its rights to new PVOD platform Zee Plex.[20] Khaali Peeli was released there on 2 October 2020, coinciding with Gandhi Jayanti.[21] It was simultaneously released in drive-in theatres of Gurugram and Bengaluru.[22]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe film released on the Zee Plex platform alongside Ka Pae Ranasingam. Devansh Sharma from Firstpost wrote, \"After Beyond The Clouds and Dhadak, Khatter puts on display yet another side of his multifaceted personality. Khaali Peeli is his most 'commercial' film yet, a la Ranveer Singh in Rohit Shetty's Simmba. But rather than mimicking his idols, Khatter invents his style in conformity with a Mumbai taxi driver on a steady diet of Bollywood films for years \u2014 and makes a meal of it.[23] Soumya Srivastava from Hindustan Times stated, \"Khaali Peeli is a concoction that can only be brewed in the belly of Bollywood. With one chase sequence following on the tails of another, director Maqbool Khan ensures not a single moment is without its adrenaline dialled up to an 11. But it\u2019s quite shocking how easily one can grow bored of craziness as well\" [24]\nShubra Gupta from The Indian Express said, \" Khaali Peeli knows that it needs to refresh the tropes it is up against, and manages to do so only some of the time in its two-hour duration.\"[25] Uma Ramasubramanian from Mid-Day wrote \"Khaali Peeli is the perfect package for Khatter, who gets to showcase his dancing skills, action, drama, romance, comedy and biceps. Known for his love for offbeat films \u2014 Majid Majidi's Beyond the Clouds (2017) and forthcoming A Suitable Boy (2020) \u2014 the wonder boy is equally crackling in a typical Bollywood entertainer. Panday, though she carries the role efficiently, doesn't deliver authenticity to the character.\"[26]\n\nControversies[edit]\nThe song \"Beyonce Sharma Jaayegi\" was criticised online for lyrics that some found racist.[11][12][13] The song has been contrasted with Beyonc\u00e9's \"Brown Skin Girl\", as Rolling Stone India pointed out how on one hand, Beyonc\u00e9 is working towards the racial empowerment through her song, but the Bollywood song, names her, and says she will be \"embarrassed of fairskined Ananya Panday's dancing skills\".[14] HuffPost India wrote \"What's a bit of racism sprinkled over the regular dose of sexism\".[15] News18 India said \"It seems despite the Black Lives Matter movement, the hashtags and the social media outrage, Bollywood hasn't learned much about racism\".[16] After receiving heavy backlash online, the director Maqbool Khan apologised.
